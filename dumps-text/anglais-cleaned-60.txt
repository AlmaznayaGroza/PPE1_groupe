level of consciousness loc is a medical term used to describe how
awake alert and aware you are

 it also refers to how well you respond
to attempts to get your attention

 a person with an altered level of
consciousness may have decreased cognitive function or be difficult to
arouse



a variety of medical conditions and drugs can affect your level of
consciousness from having dementia or lethargy to being in a coma


sometimes impaired consciousness is reversible while other times it is
not



this article covers normal and altered states of consciousness as well
as coma classifications

 what is consciousness

 

medical definitions say a normal loc means a person is either awake or
can be readily awakened from normal sleep

 terms include

 consciousness a state in which a person is awake aware alert and
 responsive to stimuli
 decreased consciousness a person appears awake and aware of their
 surroundings conscious but is not responding normally acts
 confused odd or sleepy


 unconsciousness a person has a deficit in awareness and
 responsiveness to stimuli touch light sound

sleeping is not considered unconsciousness if waking up would result in
normal consciousness between consciousness and unconsciousness there are
several altered levels each with its own definition



 altered level of consciousness 

altered or abnormal levels of consciousness are states in which you
either have decreased cognitive function or cannot be easily aroused



most medical conditions affect the brain and impair consciousness when
they become serious or lifethreatening

 an altered loc usually signals
a serious medical problem



are you at risk of altered level of consciousness



if you are at risk for altered loc be sure to have the proper medical
precautions in place

 for example wear a medical alert bracelet or
download a phone app that lists your diagnoses medications and
emergency contacts

 some apps can be accessed even when your phone is
locked

 you may also want to designate a healthcare proxy to speak for
you if you are unable



often an altered loc can deteriorate rapidly from one stage to the
next

 they require timely diagnosis and prompt treatment



 confusion 

confusion describes disorientation that makes it difficult to

 reason
 provide a medical history
 participate in a medical examination

causes include

 sleep deprivation
 fever
 medications
 alcohol intoxication
 recreational drug use
 postictal state recovering from a seizure

 delirium 

delirium is a term for an acute confused state

 it involves impaired
cognition thought processes and may include

 attention deficits
 sleepwake cycle changes
 hyperactivity agitation or hypoactivity apathy
 hallucinations seeing things that are not there or delusions
 false beliefs
 heart rate and blood pressure instability

causes can include

 alcohol withdrawal
 recreational drugs
 medications
 severe infection or illness
 organ failure

delirium risks and effects

 lethargy and somnolence 

lethargy and somnolence sleepiness involve

 severe drowsiness
 listlessness
 apathy
 reduced alertness

a lethargic person may need a gentle touch or verbal stimulation before
they will respond



causes can include

 severe illness or infection
 recreational drugs
 organ failure

 loc symptoms causes
 
 normal wakefulness awareness alertness 
 confusion  disorientation inability to reason sleep deprivation fever drugsalcohol seizure recovery
 delirium  impaired cognition hallucinations delusions agitation or apathy unstable heart rate and blood pressure alcohol withdrawal drugs illness organ failure severe infection
 lethargy and somnolence severe drowsiness listlessness apathy reduced alertness severe illness severe infection drug use organ failure
 obtundation reduced alertness slow responses to stimuli prolonged periods of sleep drowsiness while awake poisoning stroke brain swelling blood infection advanced organ failure
 stupor minimal response to vigorous stimuli stroke drug overdose lack of oxygen brain swelling heart attack
 coma  unresponsiveness to all stimuli may lack gag reflex andor pupil response severely diminished brain function extreme blood loss organ failure brain damage

 obtundation 

obtundation is reduced alertness with

 slow responses to stimuli
 need of repeated stimulation to maintain attention
 prolonged periods of sleep
 drowsiness between these periods

causes can include

 poisoning
 stroke
 brain edema swelling
 sepsis a blood infection
 advanced organ failure

 stupor 

someone in a stupor responds minimally to vigorous stimulation such as
a pinched toe or light in the eyes



causes can include

 stroke
 drug overdose
 lack of oxygen
 brain edema
 myocardial infarction heart attack

 coma 

a person in a coma does not respond to any stimuli

 their pupils may not
react to light and they may not have a gag reflex



comas are caused by severely diminished brain function

 this is usually
due to

 stroke
 alcohol poisoning
 extreme hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia
 extreme blood loss
 organ failure
 brain damage or infection

what is myxedema coma



the causes of altered loc may overlap

 for example the early stages of
brain edema or organ failure can cause confusion but then advance
rapidly through lethargy obtundation stupor and coma



 levels of consciousness assessment scale 

levels of consciousness can be subdivided into levels that further
clarify your degree of unresponsiveness

 that helps improve
communication among healthcare providers as well as aiding in research



several systems have been developed to standardize these
classifications

 the most common classification systems are

 grady coma scale grades a coma from i to v

 grady is based on the
 state of awareness and response to stimuli e

g

 name being called
 light pain deep pain

 grade i indicates confusion while v
 indicates coma no response to stimuli


 glasgow coma scale scores the level of consciousness from 1 to 15
 with 15 being normal loc

 this scale takes into account verbal
 motor and eye responses to stimuli



nursing assessment of loc

nurses may evaluate loc based on the following categories

 alert opens eyes spontaneously looks at the speaker when spoken to
 in a normal voice responds appropriately to stimuli and movements
 are purposeful
 lethargic appears drowsy but opens eyes to loud verbal stimuli


 looks at the speaker and responds to questions before falling back
 to sleep


 obtundation opens eyes with tactile stimuli and looks to the source
 but responds slowly and may be confused
 stupor awakens only after a painful stimulus is applied e

g


 applying pressure to the nailbed

 verbal responses are slow or
 absent

 will fall into an unresponsive state when the stimulus
 stops


 coma unarouseable and eyes remain closed

 there are no purposeful
 responses to internal or external stimuli

 however nonpurposeful
 responses to painful stimuli and brain stem reflexes may still be
 present



 summary 

levels of consciousness range from normal alertness and attention to
gradations of altered states including confusion delirium stupor and
coma



the same conditions may produce mild to severe states of altered loc


sometimes there may be a rapid progression from a mild to a high stage



coma scales can help describe the exact level of consciousness
