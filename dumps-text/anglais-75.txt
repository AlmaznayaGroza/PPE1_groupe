-   Altered LOC

-   Coma Classifications

"Level of consciousness" (LOC) is a medical term used to describe how
awake, alert, and aware you are. It also refers to how well you respond
to attempts to get your attention. A person with an altered level of
consciousness may have decreased cognitive function or be difficult to
arouse.

A variety of medical conditions and drugs can affect your level of
consciousness, from having dementia or lethargy to being in a coma.
Sometimes impaired consciousness is reversible, while other times it is
not.

This article covers normal and altered states of consciousness as well
as coma classifications.

 What Is Consciousness? 

Medical definitions say a normal LOC means a person is either awake or
can be readily awakened from normal sleep. Terms include:

-   Consciousness: A state in which a person is awake, aware, alert, and
    responsive to stimuli
-   Decreased consciousness: A person appears awake and aware of their
    surroundings (conscious) but is not responding normally (acts
    confused, odd, or sleepy).
-   Unconsciousness: A person has a deficit in awareness and
    responsiveness to stimuli (touch, light, sound)

Sleeping is not considered unconsciousness if waking up would result in
normal consciousness Between consciousness and unconsciousness there are
several altered levels, each with its own definition.

 Altered Level of Consciousness 

Altered or abnormal levels of consciousness are states in which you
either have decreased cognitive function or cannot be easily aroused.

Most medical conditions affect the brain and impair consciousness when
they become serious or life-threatening. An altered LOC usually signals
a serious medical problem.

Are You at Risk of Altered Level of Consciousness?

If you are at risk for altered LOC, be sure to have the proper medical
precautions in place. For example, wear a medical alert bracelet or
download a phone app that lists your diagnoses, medications, and
emergency contacts. Some apps can be accessed even when your phone is
locked. You may also want to designate a healthcare proxy to speak for
you if you are unable.

Often, an altered LOC can deteriorate rapidly from one stage to the
next. They require timely diagnosis and prompt treatment.

 Confusion 

Confusion describes disorientation that makes it difficult to:

-   Reason
-   Provide a medical history
-   Participate in a medical examination

Causes include:

-   Sleep deprivation
-   Fever
-   Medications
-   Alcohol intoxication
-   Recreational drug use
-   Postictal state (recovering from a seizure)

 Delirium 

Delirium is a term for an acute confused state. It involves impaired
cognition (thought processes) and may include:

-   Attention deficits
-   Sleep-wake cycle changes
-   Hyperactivity (agitation) or hypoactivity (apathy)
-   Hallucinations (seeing things that are not there) or delusions
    (false beliefs)
-   Heart rate and blood pressure instability

Causes can include:

-   Alcohol withdrawal
-   Recreational drugs
-   Medications
-   Severe infection or illness
-   Organ failure

Delirium Risks and Effects

 Lethargy and Somnolence 

Lethargy and somnolence (sleepiness) involve:

-   Severe drowsiness
-   Listlessness
-   Apathy
-   Reduced alertness

A lethargic person may need a gentle touch or verbal stimulation before
they will respond.

Causes can include:

-   Severe illness or infection
-   Recreational drugs
-   Organ failure

  Obtundation               Reduced alertness, slow responses to stimuli, prolonged periods of sleep, drowsiness while awake             Poisoning, stroke, brain swelling, blood infection, advanced organ failure
  Stupor                    Minimal response to vigorous stimuli                                                                         Stroke, drug overdose, lack of oxygen, brain swelling, heart attack
  Coma                      Unresponsiveness to all stimuli, may lack gag reflex and/or pupil response                                   Severely diminished brain function, extreme blood loss, organ failure, brain damage

 Obtundation 

Obtundation is reduced alertness with:

-   Slow responses to stimuli
-   Need of repeated stimulation to maintain attention
-   Prolonged periods of sleep
-   Drowsiness between these periods

Causes can include:

-   Poisoning
-   Stroke
-   Brain edema (swelling)
-   Sepsis (a blood infection)
-   Advanced organ failure

 Stupor 

Someone in a stupor responds minimally to vigorous stimulation, such as
a pinched toe or light in the eyes.

Causes can include:

-   Stroke
-   Drug overdose
-   Lack of oxygen
-   Brain edema
-   Myocardial infarction (heart attack)

 Coma 

A person in a coma does not respond to any stimuli. Their pupils may not
react to light, and they may not have a gag reflex.

Comas are caused by severely diminished brain function. This is usually
due to:

-   Stroke
-   Alcohol poisoning
-   Extreme hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia
-   Extreme blood loss
-   Organ failure
-   Brain damage or infection

What Is Myxedema Coma?

The causes of altered LOC may overlap. For example, the early stages of
brain edema or organ failure can cause confusion but then advance
rapidly through lethargy, obtundation, stupor, and coma.

 Levels of Consciousness Assessment Scale 

Levels of consciousness can be subdivided into levels that further
clarify your degree of unresponsiveness. That helps improve
communication among healthcare providers as well as aiding in research.

Several systems have been developed to standardize these
classifications. The most common classification systems are:

-   Grady Coma Scale: Grades a coma from I to V. Grady is based on the
    state of awareness and response to stimuli (e.g., name being called,
    light pain, deep pain). Grade I indicates confusion, while V
    indicates coma (no response to stimuli).
-   Glasgow Coma Scale: Scores the level of consciousness from 1 to 15,
    with 15 being normal LOC. This scale takes into account verbal,
    motor, and eye responses to stimuli.

Nursing Assessment of LOC

Nurses may evaluate LOC based on the following categories:

-   Alert: Opens eyes spontaneously, looks at the speaker when spoken to
    in a normal voice, responds appropriately to stimuli, and movements
    are purposeful
-   Lethargic: Appears drowsy but opens eyes to loud verbal stimuli.
    Looks at the speaker and responds to questions before falling back
    to sleep.
-   Obtundation: Opens eyes with tactile stimuli and looks to the source
    but responds slowly and may be confused
-   Stupor: Awakens only after a painful stimulus is applied (e.g.,
    applying pressure to the nailbed). Verbal responses are slow or
    absent. Will fall into an unresponsive state when the stimulus
    stops.
-   Coma: Unarouseable and eyes remain closed. There are no purposeful
    responses to internal or external stimuli. However, nonpurposeful
    responses to painful stimuli and brain stem reflexes may still be
    present.

 Summary 

Levels of consciousness range from normal alertness and attention to
gradations of altered states, including confusion, delirium, stupor, and
coma.

The same conditions may produce mild to severe states of altered LOC.
Sometimes, there may be a rapid progression from a mild to a high stage.

Coma scales can help describe the exact level of consciousness.
