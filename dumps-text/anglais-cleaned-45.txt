activism which use awareness campaigns

consciousness raising also called awareness raising is a form of
activism popularized by united states feminists in the late 1960s

 it
often takes the form of a group of people attempting to focus the
attention of a wider group on some cause or condition

 common issues
include diseases e

g

 breast cancer aids conflicts e

g

 the darfur
genocide global warming movements e

g

 greenpeace peta earth hour
and political parties or politicians

 since informing the populace of a
public concern is often regarded as the first step to changing how the
institutions handle it raising awareness is often the first activity in
which any advocacy group engages



however in practice raising awareness is often combined with other
activities such as fundraising membership drives or advocacy in order
to harness andor sustain the motivation of new supporters which may be
at its highest just after they have learned and digested the new
information



the term awareness raising is used in the yogyakarta principles against
discriminatory attitudes1 and lgbt stereotypes as well as the
convention on the rights of persons with disabilities to combat
stereotypes prejudices and harmful practices toward people with
disabilities

terminology

edit

until the early17th century english speakers used the word
consciousness in the sense of moral knowledge of right or wrong—a
concept today referred to as conscience

in feminism

edit

consciousness raising groups were formed by new york radical women an
early women s liberation group in new york city and quickly spread
throughout the united states

 in november 1967 a group including
shulamith firestone anne koedt kathie sarachild originally kathie
amatniek and carol hanisch began meeting in koedt s apartment


meetings often involved going around the room and talking about issues
in their own lives

 the phrase consciousness raising was coined to
describe the process when kathie sarachild took up the phrase from anne
forer

 in the old left they used to say that the workers don t know they re
 oppressed so we have to raise their consciousness

 one night at a
 meeting i said would everybody please give me an example from their
 own life on how they experienced oppression as a woman

 i need to hear
 it to raise my own consciousness

 kathie was sitting behind me and
 the words rang in her mind

 from then on she sort of made it an
 institution and called it consciousnessraising



 — anne forer4

on thanksgiving 1968 kathie sarachild presented a program for feminist
consciousness raising at the first national women s liberation
conference near chicago illinois in which she explained the principles
behind consciousnessraising and outlined a program for the process that
the new york groups had developed over the past year

 groups founded by
former members of new york radical women—in particular redstockings
founded out of the breakup of the nyrw in 1969 and new york radical
feminists—promoted consciousness raising and distributed mimeographed
sheets of suggesting topics for consciousness raising group meetings


new york radical feminists organized neighborhoodbased c

r

 groups in
manhattan brooklyn and queens involving as many as four hundred women
in c

r

 groups at its peak

5 over the next few years smallgroup
consciousness raising spread rapidly in cities and suburbs throughout
the united states

 by 1971 the chicago women s liberation union which
had already organized several consciousness raising groups in chicago
described small consciousness raising groups as the backbone of the
women s liberation movement

6 susan brownmiller a member of the
west villagea would later write that smallgroup consciousness
raising was the movement s most successful form of female bonding and
the source of most of its creative thinking

 some of the small groups
stayed together for more than a decade

7

in 1973 probably the height of cr 100000 women in the united states
belonged to cr groups

8

early midcentury feminists argued that women were isolated from each
other and as a result many problems in women s lives were misunderstood
as personal or as the results of conflicts between the personalities
of individual men and women rather than systematic forms of oppression


raising consciousness meant helping oneself and helping others to become
politically conscious

 consciousness raising groups aimed to get a
better understanding of women s oppression by bringing women together to
discuss and analyze their lives without interference from the presence
of men

9

while explaining the theory behind consciousness raising in a 1973 talk
kathie sarachild remarked that from the beginning of
consciousnessraising 





 there has been no one method of raising
consciousness

 what really counts in consciousnessraising are not
methods but results

 the only methods of consciousness raising are
essentially principles

 they are the basic radical political principles
of going to the original sources both historic and personal going to
people—women themselves and going to experience for theory and
strategy

10 however most consciousness raising groups did follow
a similar pattern for meeting and discussion

 meetings would usually be
held about once a week with a small group of women often in the living
room of one of the members

 meetings were womenonly and usually
involved going around the room for each woman to talk about a
predetermined subject—for example when you think about having a child
would you rather have a boy or a girl

citation needed—speaking
from her own experience with no formal leader for the discussion and
few rules for directing or limiting discussion

 some c

r

 groups did
implement rules designed to give every woman a chance to speak to
prevent interruptions etc

 speaking from personal experience was used
as a basis for further discussion and analysis based on the firsthand
knowledge that was shared

citation needed

some feminist advocates of consciousness raising argued that the process
allowed women to analyze the conditions of their own lives and to
discover ways in which what had seemed like isolated individual
problems such as needing an abortion surviving rape conflicts between
husbands and wives over housework etc

 actually reflected common
conditions faced by all women

citation needed as sarachild wrote in
1969 we assume that our feelings are telling us something from which
we can learn





 that our feelings mean something worth analyzing





 that
our feelings are saying something political something reflecting fear
that something bad will happen to us or hope desire knowledge that
something good will happen to us

 





 in our groups let s share our
feelings and pool them

 let s let ourselves go and see where our
feelings lead us

 our feelings will lead us to ideas and then to
actions

11

ellen willis wrote in 1984 that consciousness raising has often been
misunderstood and disparaged as a form of therapy but that it was in
fact in its time and context the primary method of understanding
women s condition and constituted the movement s most successful
organizing tool

 at the same time she saw the lack of theory and
emphasis on personal experience as concealing prior political and
philosophical assumptions

12

however some in the feminist movement criticised consciousness raising
groups as trivial and apolitical

13

through poetry

edit

historically poetry has been used as a consciousnessraising tactic by
consciousnessraising groups

14 activist and writer audre lorde was
noted to have been one of many scholars who wrote of poetry as a means
of communication for women of color activist and resistance
groups

15 this focus has also been studied by other feminist
scholars as a new approach to women s literary writing
experience16 and the usage of critical consciousness through the
creation of art as a liberatory praxis

17 art as a liberatory
praxis has also been explored through a radical queer lens through a
number of publications and journals such as sinister wisdom18 and
conditions19 online publications with an emphasis on lesbian
writing



for lgbt rights

edit

in the 1960s consciousnessraising caught on with gay liberation
activists20 who formed the first comingout groups which helped
participants come out of the closet among welcoming tolerant
individuals and share personal stories about coming out

 the idea of
coming out as a tool of consciousnessraising had been preceded by even
earlier opinions from german theorists such as magnus hirschfeld iwan
bloch and karl heinrich ulrichs all of whom saw selfdisclosure as a
means of selfemancipation the raising of consciousness among fellow
uncloseted individuals and a means of raising awareness in the wider
society

citation needed

in atheism

edit

in the god delusion antireligion activist richard dawkins uses the
term consciousness raising for several other things explicitly
describing these as analogous to the feminist case

21 these include
replacing references to children as catholic muslim etc

 with
references to children of the adults who are members of these religions
which he compares to our using nonsexist terminology and darwin as
raising our consciousness in biology to the possibility of explaining
complexity naturalistically and in principle raising our consciousness
to the possibility of doing such things elsewhere especially in
physics

21 earlier in the book he uses the term without
explicitly referring to feminism to refer to making people aware that
leaving their parents faith is an option
