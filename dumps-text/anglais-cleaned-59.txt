the question is not what goal is envisaged for the time being by this or
that member of the proletariat or even by the proletariat as a whole


the question is what is the proletariat and what course of action will
it be forced historically to take in conformity with its own nature


marx the holy family





marx s chief work breaks off just as he is about to embark on the
definition of class

 this omission was to have serious consequences both
for the theory and the practice of the proletariat

 for on this vital
point the later movement was forced to base itself on interpretations
on the collation of occasional utterances by marx and engels and on the
independent extrapolation and application of their method

 in marxism
the division of society into classes is determined by position within
the process of production

 but what then is the meaning of class
consciousness

 the question at once branches out into a series of
closely interrelated problems

 first of all how are we to understand
class consciousness in theory

 second what is the practical
function of class consciousness so understood in the context of the
class struggle

 this leads to the further question is the problem of
class consciousness a general sociological problem or does it mean one
thing for the proletariat and another for every other class to have
emerged hitherto

 and lastly is class consciousness homogeneous in
nature and function or can we discern different gradations and levels in
it

 and if so what are their practical implications for the class
struggle of the proletariat



1

in his celebrated account of historical materialism 1 engels
proceeds from the assumption that although the essence of history
consists in the fact that “nothing happens without a conscious purpose
or an intended aim” to understand history it is necessary to go further
than this

 for on the one hand “the many individual wills active in
history for the most part produce results quite other than those
intended – often quite the opposite their motives therefore in
relation to the total result are likewise of only secondary importance


on the other hand the further question arises what driving forces in
turn stand behind these motives

 what are the historical causes which
transform themselves into these motives in the brain of the actors

” he
goes on to argue that these driving forces ought themselves to be
determined in particular those which “set in motion great masses whole
peoples and again whole classes of the people and which create

 a
lasting action resulting in a great transformation

” the essence of
scientific marxism consists then in the realisation that the real
motor forces of history are independent of man s psychological
consciousness of them



at a more primitive stage of knowledge this independence takes the form
of the belief that these forces belong as it were to nature and that
in them and in their causal interactions it is possible to discern the
 eternal laws of nature

 as marx says of bourgeois thought “man s
reflections on the forms of social life and consequently also his
scientific analysis of those forms take a course directly opposite to
that of their actual historical development

 he begins post festum with
the results of the process of development ready to hand before him

 the
characters 





 have already acquired the stability of natural
selfunderstood forms of social life before man seeks to decipher not
their historical character for in his eyes they are immutable but
their meaning

” 2

this is a dogma whose most important spokesmen can be found in the
political theory of classical german philosophy and in the economic
theory of adam smith and ricardo

 marx opposes to them a critical
philosophy a theory of theory and a consciousness of consciousness


this critical philosophy implies above all historical criticism

 it
dissolves the rigid unhistorical natural appearance of social
institutions it reveals their historical origins and shows therefore
that they are subject to history in every respect including historical
decline

 consequently history does not merely unfold within the terrain
mapped out by these institutions

 it does not resolve itself into the
evolution of contents of men and situations etc

 while the principles
of society remain eternally valid

 nor are these institutions the goal
to which all history aspires such that when they are realised history
will have fulfilled her mission and will then be at an end

 on the
contrary history is precisely the history of these institutions of the
changes they undergo as institutions which bring men together in
societies

 such institutions start by controlling economic relations
between men and go on to permeate all human relations and hence also
man s relations with himself and with nature etc





at this point bourgeois thought must come up against an insuperable
obstacle for its startingpoint and its goal are always if not always
consciously an apologia for the existing order of things or at least
the proof of their immutability

 3 “thus there has been history
but there is no longer any” 4 marx observes with reference to
bourgeois economics a dictum which applies with equal force to all
attempts by bourgeois thinkers to understand the process of history

 it
has often been pointed out that this is also one of the defects of
hegel s philosophy of history

 as a result while bourgeois thought is
indeed able to conceive of history as a problem it remains an
intractable problem

 either it is forced to abolish the process of
history and regard the institutions of the present as eternal laws of
nature which for mysterious reasons and in a manner wholly at odds
with the principles of a rational science were held to have failed to
establish themselves firmly or indeed at all in the past

 this is
characteristic of bourgeois sociology

 or else everything meaningful
or purposive is banished from history

 it then becomes impossible to
advance beyond the mere individuality of the various epochs and their
social and human representatives

 history must then insist with ranke
that every age is “equally close to god” i

e

 has attained an equal
degree of perfection and thatfor quite different reasonsthere is no
such thing as historical development



in the first case it ceases to be possible to understand the origin of
social institutions

 5 the objects of history appear as the objects
of immutable eternal laws of nature

 history becomes fossilised in a
formalism incapable of comprehending that the real nature of
sociohistorical institutions is that they consist of relations between
men

 on the contrary men become estranged from this the true source of
historical understanding and cut off from it by an unbridgeable gulf

 as
marx points out 6 people fail to realise “that these definite
social relations are just as much the products of men as linen

 flax
etc

”



in the second case history is transformed into the irrational rule of
blind forces which is embodied at best in the spirit of the people or
in great men 

 it can therefore only be described pragmatically but it
cannot be rationally understood

 its only possible organisation would be
aesthetic as if it were a work of art

 or else as in the philosophy of
history of the kantians it must be seen as the instrument senseless in
itself by means of which timeless suprahistorical ethical principles
are realised



marx resolves this dilemma by exposing it as an illusion

 the dilemma
means only that the contradictions of the capitalist system of
production are reflected in these mutually incompatible accounts of the
same object

 for in this historiography with its search for
 sociological laws or its formalistic rationale we find the reflection
of man s plight in bourgeois society and of his helpless enslavement by
the forces of production

 “to them their own social action” marx
remarks 7 “takes the form of the action of objects which rule the
producers instead of being ruled by them”

 this law was expressed most
clearly and coherently in the purely natural and rational laws of
classical economics

 marx retorted with the demand for a historical
critique of economics which resolves the totality of the reified
objectivities of social and economic life into relations between men


capital and with it every form in which the national economy objectives
itself is according to marx “not a thing but a social relation between
persons mediated through things”

 8

however by reducing the objectivity of the social institutions so
hostile to man to relations between men marx also does away with the
false implications of the irrationalist and individualist principle
i

e

 the other side of the dilemma

 for to eliminate the objectivity
attributed both to social institutions inimical to man and to their
historical evolution means the restoration of this objectivity to their
underlying basis to the relations between men it does not involve the
elimination of laws and objectivity independent of the will of man and
in particular the wills and thoughts of individual men

 it simply means
that this objectivity is the selfobjectification of human society at a
particular stage in its development its laws hold good only within the
framework of the historical context which produced them and which is in
turn determined by them



it might look as though by dissolving the dilemma in this manner we were
denying consciousness any decisive role in the process of history

 it is
true that the conscious reflexes of the different stages of economic
growth remain historical facts of great importance it is true that
while dialectical materialism is itself the product of this process it
does not deny that men perform their historical deeds themselves and
that they do so consciously

 but as engels emphasises in a letter to
mehring 9 this consciousness is false

 however the dialectical
method does not permit us simply to proclaim the falseness of this
consciousness and to persist in an inflexible confrontation of true and
false

 on the contrary it requires us to investigate this false
consciousness concretely as an aspect of the historical totality and as
a stage in the historical process



of course bourgeois historians also attempt such concrete analyses
indeed they reproach historical materialists with violating the concrete
uniqueness of historical events

 where they go wrong is in their belief
that the concrete can be located in the empirical individual of history
 individual here can refer to an individual man class or people and
in his empirically given and hence psychological or masspsychological
consciousness

 and just when they imagine that they have discovered the
most concrete thing of all society as a concrete totality the system
of production at a given point in history and the resulting division of
society into classes – they are in fact at the furthest remove from it


in missing the mark they mistake something wholly abstract for the
concrete

 “these relations” marx states “are not those between one
individual and another but between worker and capitalist tenant and
landlord etc

 eliminate these relations and you abolish the whole of
society your prometheus will then be nothing more than a spectre
without arms or legs

 





” 10

concrete analysis means then the relation to society as a whole

 for
only when this relation is established does the consciousness of their
existence that men have at any given time emerge in all its essential
characteristics

 it appears on the one hand as something which is
subjectively justified in the social and historical situation as
something which can and should be understood i

e

 as right 

 at the
same time objectively it bypasses the essence of the evolution of
society and fails to pinpoint it and express it adequately

 that is to
say objectively it appears as a false consciousness 

 on the other
hand we may see the same consciousness as something which fails
subjectively to reach its selfappointed goals while furthering and
realising the objective aims of society of which it is ignorant and
which it did not choose



this twofold dialectical determination of false consciousness 
constitutes an analysis far removed from the naive description of what
men in fact thought felt and wanted at any moment in history and from
any given point in the class structure

 i do not wish to deny the great
importance of this but it remains after all merely the material of
genuine historical analysis

 the relation with concrete totality and the
dialectical determinants arising from it transcend pure description and
yield the category of objective possibility

 by relating consciousness
to the whole of society it becomes possible to infer the thoughts and
feelings which men would have in a particular situation if they were
able to assess both it and the interests arising from it in their impact
on immediate action and on the whole structure of society

 that is to
say it would be possible to infer the thoughts and feelings appropriate
to their objective situation

 the number of such situations is not
unlimited in any society

 however much detailed researches are able to
refine social typologies there will always be a number of clearly
distinguished basic types whose characteristics are determined by the
types of position available in the process of production

 now class
consciousness consists in fact of the appropriate and rational reactions
 imputed zugerechnet to a particular typical position in the process
of production

11 this consciousness is therefore neither the sum
nor the average of what is thought or felt by the single individuals who
make up the class

 and yet the historically significant actions of the
class as a whole are determined in the last resort by this consciousness
and not by the thought of the individual – and these actions can be
understood only by reference to this consciousness



this analysis establishes right from the start the distance that
separates class consciousness from the empirically given and from the
psychologically describable and explicable ideas which men form about
their situation in life

 but it is not enough just to state that this
distance exists or even to define its implications in a formal and
general way

 we must discover firstly whether it is a phenomenon that
differs according to the manner in which the various classes are related
to society as a whole and whether the differences are so great as to
produce qualitative distinctions

 and we must discover secondly the
practical significance of these different possible relations between the
objective economic totality the imputed class consciousness and the
real psychological thoughts of men about their lives

 we must discover
in short the practical historical function of class consciousness



only after such preparatory formulations can we begin to exploit the
category of objective possibility systematically

 the first question we
must ask is how far is it intact possible to discern the whole economy
of a society from inside it

 it is essential to transcend the
limitations of particular individuals caught up in their own narrow
prejudices

 but it is no less vital not to overstep the frontier fixed
for them by the economic structure of society and establishing their
position in it

 12 regarded abstractly and formally then class
consciousness implies a classconditioned unconsciousness of ones own
sociohistorical and economic condition

 13 this condition is given
as a definite structural relation a definite formal nexus which appears
to govern the whole of life

 the falseness the illusion implicit in
this situation is in no sense arbitrary it is simply the intellectual
reflex of the objective economic structure

 thus for example “the
value or price of labourpower takes on the appearance of the price or
value of labour itself 





” and “the illusion is created that the
totality is paid labour







 in contrast to that under slavery even that
portion of labour which is paid for appears unpaid for

” 14 now it
requires the most painstaking historical analysis to use the category of
objective possibility so as to isolate the conditions in which this
illusion can be exposed and a real connection with the totality
established

 for if from the vantage point of a particular class the
totality of existing society is not visible if a class thinks the
thoughts imputable to it and which bear upon its interests right through
to their logical conclusion and yet fails to strike at the heart of that
totality then such a class is doomed to play only a subordinate role


it can never influence the course of history in either a conservative or
progressive direction

 such classes are normally condemned to passivity
to an unstable oscillation between the ruling and the revolutionary
classes and if perchance they do erupt then such explosions are purely
elemental and aimless

 they may win a few battles but they are doomed to
ultimate defeat



for a class to be ripe for hegemony means that its interests and
consciousness enable it to organise the whole of society in accordance
with those interests

 the crucial question in every class struggle is
this which class possesses this capacity and this consciousness at the
decisive moment 

 this does not preclude the use of force

 it does not
mean that the classinterests destined to prevail and thus to uphold the
interests of society as a whole can be guaranteed an automatic victory


on the contrary such a transfer of power can often only be brought
about by the most ruthless use of force as e

g

 the primitive
accumulation of capital

 but it often turns out that questions of class
consciousness prove to be decisive in just those situations where force
is unavoidable and where classes are locked in a
lifeanddeathstruggle

 thus the noted hungarian marxist erwin szabo is
mistaken in criticising engels for maintaining that the great peasant
war of 1525 was essentially a reactionary movement

 szabo argues that
the peasants revolt was suppressed only by the ruthless use of force
and that its defeat was not grounded in socioeconomic factors and in the
class consciousness of the peasants

 he overlooks the fact that the
deepest reason for the weakness of the peasantry and the superior
strength of the princes is to be sought in class consciousness

 even the
most cursory student of the military aspects of the peasants war can
easily convince himself of this



it must not be thought however that all classes ripe for hegemony have
a class consciousness with the same inner structure

 everything hinges
on the extent to which they can become conscious of the actions they
need to perform in order to obtain and organise power

 the question then
becomes how far does the class concerned perform the actions history
has imposed on it consciously or unconsciously 

 and is that
consciousness true or false 

 these distinctions are by no means
academic

 quite apart from problems of culture where such fissures and
dissonances are crucial in all practical matters too the fate of a
class depends on its ability to elucidate and solve the problems with
which history confronts it

 and here it becomes transparently obvious
that class consciousness is concerned neither with the thoughts of
individuals however advanced nor with the state of scientific
knowledge

 for example it is quite clear that ancient society was
broken economically by the limitations of a system built on slavery

 but
it is equally clear that neither the ruling classes nor the classes that
rebelled against them in the name of revolution or reform could perceive
this

 in consequence the practical emergence of these problems meant
that the society was necessarily and irremediably doomed



the situation

 is even clearer in the case of the modern bourgeoisie
which armed with its knowledge of the workings of economics clashed
with feudal and absolutist society

 for the bourgeoisie was quite unable
to perfect its fundamental science its own science of classes the reef
on which it foundered was its failure to discover even a theoretical
solution to the problem of crises

 the fact that a scientifically
acceptable solution does exist is of no avail

 for to accept that
solution even in theory would be tantamount to observing society from
a class standpoint other than that of the bourgeoisie

 and no class can
do that – unless it is willing to abdicate its power freely

 thus the
barrier which converts the class consciousness of the bourgeoisie into
 false consciousness is objective it is the class situation itself

 it
is the objective result of the economic setup and is neither
arbitrary subjective nor psychological

 the class consciousness of the
bourgeoisie may well be able to reflect all the problems of organisation
entailed by its hegemony and by the capitalist transformation and
penetration of total production

 but it becomes obscured as soon as it
is called upon to face problems that remain within its jurisdiction but
which point beyond the limits of capitalism

 the discovery of the
natural laws of economics is pure light in comparison with medieval
feudalism or even the mercantilism of the transitional period but by an
internal dialectical twist they became “natural laws based on the
unconsciousness of those who are involved in them”

 15

it would be beyond the scope of these pages to advance further and
attempt to construct a historical and systematic typology of the
possible degrees of class consciousness

 that would require – in the
first instance – an exact study of the point in the total process of
production at which the interests of the various classes are most
immediately and vitally involved

 secondly we would have to show how
far it would be in the interest of any given class to go beyond this
immediacy to annul and transcend its immediate interest by seeing it as
a factor within a totality

 and lastly what is the nature of the
totality that is then achieved

 how far does it really embrace the true
totality of production

 it is quite evident that the quality and
structure of class consciousness must be very different if e

g

 it
remains stationary at the separation of consumption from production as
with the roman lumpenproletariat or if it represents the formation of
the interests of circulation as with merchant capital

 although we
cannot embark on a systematic typology of the various points of view it
can be seen from the foregoing that these specimens of false 
consciousness differ from each other both qualitatively structurally
and in a manner that is crucial for the activity of the classes in
society



2

it follows from the above that for precapitalist epochs and for the
behaviour of many strata within capitalism whose economic roots lie in
precapitalism class consciousness is unable to achieve complete
clarity and to influence the course of history consciously



this is true above all because class interests in precapitalist society
never achieve full economic articulation

 hence the structuring of
society into castes and estates means that economic elements are
inextricably joined to political and religious factors

 in contrast to
this the rule of the bourgeoisie means the abolition of the
estatessystem and this leads to the organisation of society along class
lines

 in many countries vestiges of the feudal system still survive
but this does not detract from the validity of this observation



this situation has its roots in the profound difference between
capitalist and precapitalist economics

 the most striking distinction
and the one that directly concerns us is that precapitalist societies
are much less cohesive than capitalism

 the various parts are much more
selfsufficient and less closely interrelated than in capitalism


commerce plays a smaller role in society the various sectors were more
autonomous as in the case of village communes or else plays no part at
all in the economic life of the community and in the process of
production as was true of large numbers of citizens in greece and
rome

 in such circumstances the state i

e

 the organised unity
remains insecurely anchored in the real life of society

 one sector of
society simply lives out its natural existence in what amounts to a
total independence of the fate of the state

 “the simplicity of the
organisation for production in these selfsufficient communities that
constantly reproduce themselves in the same form and when accidentally
destroyed spring up again on the spot and with the same name – this
simplicity supplies the key to the secret of the immutability of asiatic
societies an immutability in such striking contrast with the constant
dissolution and resounding of asiatic states and the neverceasing
changes of dynasty

 the structure of the economic elements of society
remains untouched by the stormclouds of the political sky

” 16

yet another sector of society is – economically – completely parasitic


for this sector the state with its power apparatus is not as it is for
the ruling classes under capitalism a means whereby to put into
practice the principles of its economic power – if need be with the aid
of force

 nor is it the instrument it uses to create the conditions for
its economic dominance as with modern colonialism

 that is to say the
state is not a mediation of the economic control of society it is that
unmediated dominance itself

 this is true not merely in cases of the
straightforward theft of land or slaves but also in socalled peaceful
economic relations

 thus in connection with labourrent marx says
“under such circumstances the surplus labour can be extorted from them
for the benefit of the nominal landowner only by other than economic
pressure

” in asia “rent and taxes coincide or rather there is no tax
other than this form of groundrent”

 17

even commerce is not able in the forms it assumes in precapitalist
societies to make decisive inroads on the basic structure of society


its impact remains superficial and the process of production above all
in relation to labour remains beyond its control

 “a merchant could buy
every commodity but labour as a commodity he could not buy

 he existed
only on sufferance as a dealer in the products of the handicrafts

”
18

despite all this every such society constitutes an economic unity

 the
only question that arises is whether this unity enables the individual
sectors of society to relate to society as a whole in such a way that
their imputed consciousness can assume an economic form

 marx emphasises
19 that in greece and rome the class struggle “chiefly took the
form of a conflict between debtors and creditors”

 but he also makes the
further very valid point “nevertheless the moneyrelationship – and
the relationship of creditor to debtor is one of money – reflects only
the deeperlying antagonism between the economic conditions of
existence

” historical materialism showed that this reflection was no
more than a reflection but we must go on to ask was it at all possible
– objectively – for the classes in such a society to become conscious of
the economic basis of these conflicts and of the economic problems with
which the society was afflicted

 was it not inevitable that these
conflicts and problems should assume either natural religious forms 
20 or else political and legal ones depending on circumstances 



the division of society into estates or castes means in effect that
conceptually and organisationally these natural forms are established
without their economic basis ever becoming conscious

 it means that
there is no mediation between the pure traditionalism of natural growth
and the legal institutions it assumes

 21 in accordance with the
looser economic structure of society the political and legal
institutions here the division into estates privileges etc

 have
different functions objectively and subjectively from those exercised
under capitalism

 in capitalism these institutions merely imply the
stabilisation of purely economic forces so that – as karner has ably
demonstrated 22 – they frequently adapt themselves to changed
economic structures without changing themselves in form or content

 by
contrast in precapitalist societies legal institutions intervene
substantively in the interplay of economic forces

 in fact there are no
purely economic categories to appear or to be given legal form and
according to marx economic categories are “forms of existence
determinations of life”

 23 economic and legal categories are
objectively and substantively so interwoven as to be inseparable


consider here the instances cited earlier of labourrent and taxes of
slavery etc

 in hegel s parlance the economy has not even objectively
reached the stage of beingforitself

 there is therefore no possible
position within such a society from which the economic basis of all
social relations could be made conscious



this is not of course to deny the objective economic foundations of
social institutions

 on the contrary the history of feudal estates
shows very clearly that what in origin had been a natural economic
existence cast into stable forms begins gradually to disintegrate as a
result of subterranean unconscious economic development

 that is to
say it ceases to be a real unity

 their economic content destroys the
unity of their juridical form

 ample proof of this is furnished both by
engels in his analysis of the class struggles of the reformation

 period
and by cunow in his discussion of the french revolution

 however
despite this conflict between juridical form and economic content the
juridical privilegecreating forms retain a great and often absolutely
crucial importance for the consciousness of estates in the process of
disintegration

 for the form of the estates conceals the connection
between the – real but unconscious – economic existence of the estate
and the economic totality of society

 it fixates consciousness directly
on its privileges as in the case of the knights during the reformation
or else – no less directly – on the particular element of society from
which the privileges emanated as in the case of the guilds



even when an estate has disintegrated even when its members have been
absorbed economically into a number of different classes it still
retains this objectively unreal ideological coherence

 for the
relation to the whole created by the consciousness of one s status is
not directed to the real living economic unity but to a past state of
society as constituted by the privileges accorded to the estates

 status
– consciousness – a real historical factor masks class consciousness in
fact it prevents it from emerging at all

 a like phenomenon can be
observed under capitalism in the case of all privileged groups whose
class situation lacks any immediate economic base

 the ability of such a
class to adapt itself to the real economic development can be measured
by the extent to which it succeeds in capitalising itself i

e


transforming its privileges into economic and capitalist forms of
control as was the case with the great landowners



thus class consciousness has quite a different relation to history in
precapitalist and capitalist periods

 in the former case the classes
could only be deduced from the immediately given historical reality by
the methods of historical materialism

 in capitalism they themselves
constitute this immediately given historical reality

 it is therefore no
accident that as engels too has pointed out this knowledge of history
only became possible with the advent of capitalism

 not only – as engels
believed – because of the greater simplicity of capitalism in contrast
to the complex and concealed relations of earlier ages

 but primarily
because only with capitalism does economic class interest emerge in all
its starkness as the motor of history

 in precapitalist periods man
could never become conscious not even by virtue of an imputed 
consciousness of the “true driving forces which stand behind the
motives of human actions in history”

 they remained hidden behind
motives and were in truth the blind forces of history

 ideological
factors do not merely mask economic interests they are not merely the
banners and slogans they are the parts the components of which the
real struggle is made

 of course if historical materialism is deployed
to discover the sociological meaning of these struggles economic
interests will doubtless be revealed as the decisive factors in any
explanation



but there is still an unbridgeable gulf between this and capitalism
where economic factors are not concealed behind consciousness but are
present in consciousness itself albeit unconsciously or repressed


with capitalism with the abolition of the feudal estates and with the
creation of a society with a purely economic articulation class
consciousness arrived at the point where it could become conscious

 from
then on social conflict was reflected in an ideological struggle for
consciousness and for the veiling or the exposure of the class character
of society

 but the fact that this conflict became possible points
forward to the dialectical contradictions and the internal dissolution
of pure class society

 in hegel s words “when philosophy paints its
gloomy picture a form of life has grown old

 it cannot be rejuvenated by
the gloomy picture but only understood

 only when dusk starts to fall
does the owl of minerva spread its wings and fly

bourgeoisie and proletariat are the only pure classes in bourgeois
society

 they are the only classes whose existence and development are
entirely dependent on the course taken by the modern evolution of
production and only from the vantage point of these classes can a plan
for the total organisation of society even be imagined

 the outlook of
the other classes petty bourgeois or peasants is ambiguous or sterile
because their existence is not based exclusively on their role in the
capitalist system of production but is indissolubly linked with the
vestiges of feudal society

 their aim therefore is not to advance
capitalism or to transcend it but to reverse its action or at least to
prevent it from developing fully

 their class interest concentrates on
symptoms of development and not on development itself and on elements
of society rather than on the construction of society as a whole



the question of consciousness may make its appearance in terms of the
objectives chosen or in terms of action as for instance in the case of
the petty bourgeoisie

 this class lives at least in part in the
capitalist big city and every aspect of its existence is directly
exposed to the influence of capitalism

 hence it cannot possibly remain
wholly unaffected by the fact of class conflict between bourgeoisie and
proletariat

 but as a “transitional class in which the interests of two
other classes become simultaneously blunted 





” it will imagine itself
“to be above all class antagonisms”

 24 accordingly it will search
for ways whereby it will “not indeed eliminate the two extremes of
capital and wage labour but will weaken their antagonism and transform
it into harmony”

 25 in all decisions crucial for society its
actions will be irrelevant and it will be forced to fight for both sides
in turn but always without consciousness

 in so doing its own objectives
– which exist exclusively in its own consciousness – must become
progressively weakened and increasingly divorced from social action


ultimately they will assume purely ideological forms the petty
bourgeoisie will only be able to play an active role in history as long
as these objectives happen to coincide with the real economic interests
of capitalism

 this was the case with the abolition of the feudal
estates during the french revolution

 with the fulfilment of this
mission its utterances which for the most part remain unchanged in
form become more and more remote from real events and turn finally into
mere caricatures this was true e

g

 of the jacobinism of the montagne
184851



this isolation from society as a whole has its repercussions on the
internal structure of the class and its organisational potential

 this
can be seen most clearly in the development of the peasantry

 marx says
on this point 26 “the smallholding peasants form a vast mass
whose members live in similar conditions but without entering into
manifold relations with each other

 their mode of production isolates
them from one another instead of bringing them into mutual
intercourse







 every single peasant family 





 thus acquires its means
of life more through exchange with nature than in intercourse with
society







 in so far as millions of families live under economic
conditions of existence that separate their mode of life their
interests and their culture from those of other classes and place them
in opposition to them they constitute a class

 in so far as there is
only a local connection between the smallholding peasants and the
identity of their interests begets no community no national unity and
no political organisation they do not constitute a class

” hence
external upheavals such as war revolution in the towns etc

 are
needed before these masses can coalesce in a unified movement and even
then they are incapable of organising it and supplying it with slogans
and a positive direction corresponding to their own interests



whether these movements will be progressive as in the french revolution
of 1789 or the russian revolution of 1917 or reactionary as with
napoleon s coup d état will depend on the position of the other classes
involved in the conflict and on the level of consciousness of the
parties that lead them

 for this reason too the ideological form taken
by the class consciousness of the peasants changes its content more
frequently than that of other classes this is because it is always
borrowed from elsewhere



hence parties that base themselves wholly or in part on this class
consciousness always lack really firm and secure support in critical
situations as was true of the socialist revolutionaries in 1917 and
1918

 this explains why it is possible for peasant conflicts to be
fought out under opposing flags

 thus it is highly characteristic of
both anarchism and the class consciousness of the peasantry that a
number of counterrevolutionary rebellions and uprisings of the middle
and upper strata of the peasantry in russia should have found the
anarchist view of society to be a satisfying ideology

 we cannot really
speak of class consciousness in the case of these classes if indeed
we can even speak of them as classes in the strict marxist sense of the
term for a full consciousness of their situation would reveal to them
the hopelessness of their particularise strivings in the face of the
inevitable course of events

 consciousness and selfinterest then are
mutually incompatible in this instance

 and as class consciousness was
defined in terms of the problems of imputing class interests the failure
of their class consciousness to develop in the immediately given
historical reality becomes comprehensible philosophically



with the bourgeoisie also class consciousness stands in opposition to
class interest

 but here the antagonism is not contradictory but
dialectical



the distinction between the two modes of contradiction may be briefly
described in this way in the case of the other classes a class
consciousness is prevented from emerging by their position within the
process of production and the interests this generates

 in the case of
the bourgeoisie however these factors combine to produce a class
consciousness but one which is cursed by its very nature with the tragic
fate of developing an insoluble contradiction at the very zenith of its
powers

 as a result of this contradiction it must annihilate itself



the tragedy of the bourgeoisie is reflected historically in the fact
that even before it had defeated its predecessor feudalism its new
enemy the proletariat had appeared on the scene

 politically it
became evident when at the moment of victory the freedom in whose
name the bourgeoisie had joined battle wit i feudalism was transformed
into a new repressiveness

 sociologically the bourgeoisie did
everything in its power to eradicate the fact of class conflict from the
consciousness of society even though class conflict had only emerged in
its purity and became established as an historical fact with the advent
of capitalism

 ideologically we see the same contradiction in the fact
that the bourgeoisie endowed the individual with an unprecedented
importance but at the same time that same individuality was annihilated
by the economic conditions to which it was subjected by the reification
created by commodity production



all these contradictions and the list might be extended indefinitely
are only the reflection of the deepest contradictions in capitalism
itself as they appear in the consciousness of the bourgeoisie in
accordance with their position in the total system of production

 for
this reason they appear as dialectical contradictions in the class
consciousness of the bourgeoisie

 they do not merely reflect the
inability of the bourgeoisie to grasp the contradictions inherent in its
own social order

 for on the one hand capitalism is the first system
of production able to achieve a total economic penetration of society
27 and this implies that in theory the bourgeoisie should be able
to progress from this central point to the possession of an imputed
class consciousness of the whole system of production

 on the other
hand the position held by the capitalist class and the interests which
determine its actions ensure that it will be unable to control its own
system of production even in theory



there are many reasons for this

 in the first place it only seems to be
true that for capitalism production occupies the centre of class
consciousness and hence provides the theoretical startingpoint for
analysis

 with reference to ricardo “who had been reproached with an
exclusive concern with production” marx emphasised 28 that he
“defined distribution as the sole subject of economics”

 and the
detailed analysis of the process by which capital is concretely realised
shows in every single instance that the interest of the capitalist who
produces not goods but commodities is necessarily confined to matters
that must be peripheral in terms of production

 moreover the
capitalist enmeshed in what is for him the decisive process of the
expansion of capital must have a standpoint from which the most
important problems become quite invisible

 29

the discrepancies that result are further exacerbated by the fact that
there is an insoluble contradiction running through the internal
structure of capitalism between the social and the individual principle
i

e

 between the function of capital as private property and its
objective economic function

 as the communist manifesto states “capital
is a social force and not a personal one

” but it is a social force
whose movements are determined by the individual interests of the owners
of capital – who cannot see and who are necessarily indifferent to all
the social implications of their activities

 hence the social principle
and the social function implicit in capital can only prevail unbeknown
to them and as it were against their will and behind their backs


because of this conflict between the individual and the social marx
rightly characterised the stock companies as the “negation of the
capitalist mode of production itself”

 30 of course it is true
that stock companies differ only in inessentials from individual
capitalists and even the socalled abolition of the anarchy in
production through cartels and trusts only shifts the contradiction
elsewhere without however eliminating it

 this situation forms one of
the decisive factors governing the class consciousness of the
bourgeoisie

 it is true that the bourgeoisie acts as a class in the
objective evolution of society

 but it understands the process which it
is itself instigating as something external which is subject to
objective laws which it can only experience passively



bourgeois thought observes economic life consistently and necessarily
from the standpoint of the individual capitalist and this naturally
produces a sharp confrontation between the individual and the
overpowering suprapersonal law of nature which propels all social
phenomena

 31 this leads both to the antagonism between individual
and class interests in the event of conflict which it is true rarely
becomes as acute among the

 ruling classes as in the bourgeoisie and
also to the logical impossibility of discovering theoretical and
practical solutions to the problems created by the capitalist system of
production



this sudden reversion from a system of credit to a system of hard cash
heaps theoretical fright on top of practical panic and the dealers by
whose agency circulation is effected shudder before the impenetrable
mystery in which their own economic relations are shrouded

” 32
this terror is not unfounded

 that is to say it is much more than the
bafflement felt by the individual capitalist when confronted by his own
individual fate

 the facts and the situations which induce this panic
force something into the consciousness of the bourgeoisie which is too
much of a brute fact for its existence to be wholly denied or repressed


but equally it is something that the bourgeoisie can never fully
understand

 for the recognisable background to this situation is the
fact that “the real barrier of capitalist production is capital itself”


33 and if this insight were to become conscious it would indeed
entail the selfnegation of the capitalist class



in this way the objective limits of capitalist production become the
limits of the class consciousness of the bourgeoisie

 the older
 natural and conservative forms of domination had left unmolested
34 the forms of production of whole sections of the people they
ruled and therefore exerted by and large a traditional and
unrevolutionary influence

 capitalism by contrast is a revolutionary
form par excellence

 the fact that it must necessarily remain in
ignorance of the objective economic limitations of its own system
expresses itself as an internal dialectical contradiction in its class
consciousness

this means that formally the class consciousness of the bourgeoisie is
geared to economic consciousness

 and indeed the highest degree of
unconsciousness the crassest form of false consciousness always
manifests itself when the conscious mastery of economic phenomena
appears to be at its greatest

 from the point of view of the relation of
consciousness to society this contradiction is expressed as the
irreconcilable antagonism between ideology and economic base

 its
dialectics are grounded in the irreconcilable antagonism between the
capitalist individual i

e

 the stereotyped individual of capitalism
and the natural and inevitable process of development i

e

 the
process not subject to consciousness

 in consequence theory and practice
are brought into irreconcilable opposition to each other

 but the
resulting dualism is anything but stable in fact it constantly strives
to harmonise principles that have been wrenched apart and thenceforth
oscillate between a new false synthesis and its subsequent cataclysmic
disruption



this internal dialectical contradiction in the class consciousness of
the bourgeoisie is further aggravated by the fact that the objective
limits of capitalism do not remain purely negative

 that is to say that
capitalism does not merely set natural laws in motion that provoke
crises which it cannot comprehend

 on the contrary those limits acquire
a historical embodiment with its own consciousness and its own actions
the proletariat



most normal shifts of perspective produced by the capitalist point of
view in the image of the economic structure of society tend to “obscure
and mystify the true origin of surplus value”

 35 in the normal 
purely theoretical view this mystification only attaches to the organic
composition of capital viz

 to the place of the employer in the
productive system and the economic function of interest etc

 i

e

 it
does no more than highlight the failure of observers to perceive the
true driving forces that lie beneath the surface

 but when it comes to
practice this mystification touches upon the central fact of capitalist
society the class struggle



in the class struggle we witness the emergence of all the hidden forces
that usually lie concealed behind the façade of economic life at which
the capitalists and their apologists gaze as though transfixed

 these
forces appear in such a way that they cannot possibly be ignored

 so
much so that even when capitalism was in the ascendant and the
proletariat could only give vent to its protests in the form of vehement
spontaneous explosions even the ideological exponents of the rising
bourgeoisie acknowledged the class struggle as a basic fact of history


for example marat and later historians such as mignet

 but in
proportion as the theory and practice of the proletariat made society
conscious of this unconscious revolutionary principle inherent in
capitalism the bourgeoisie was thrown back increasingly on to a
conscious defensive

 the dialectical contradiction in the false 
consciousness of the bourgeoisie became more and more acute the false 
consciousness was converted into a mendacious consciousness

 what had
been at first an objective contradiction now became subjective also the
theoretical problem turned into a moral posture which decisively
influenced every practical class attitude in every situation and on
every issue



thus the situation in which the bourgeoisie finds itself determines the
function of its class consciousness in its struggle to achieve control
of society

 the hegemony of the bourgeoisie really does embrace the
whole of society it really does attempt to organise the whole of
society in its own interests and in this it has had some success

 to
achieve this it was forced both to develop a coherent theory of
economics politics and society which in itself presupposes and amounts
to a weltanschauung and also to make conscious and sustain its faith
in its own mission to control and organise society

 the tragic
dialectics of the bourgeoisie can be seen in the fact that it is not
only desirable but essential for it to clarify its own class interests
on every particular issue while at the same time such a clear awareness
becomes fatal when it is extended to the question of the totality

 the
chief reason for this is that the rule of the bourgeoisie can only be
the rule of a minority

 its hegemony is exercised not merely by a
minority but in the interest of that minority so the need to deceive
the other classes and to ensure that their class consciousness remains
amorphous is inescapable for a bourgeois regime

 consider here the
theory of the state that stands above class antagonisms or the notion
of an impartial system of justice



but the veil drawn over the nature of bourgeois society is indispensable
to the bourgeoisie itself

 for the insoluble internal contradictions of
the system become revealed with increasing starkness and so confront
its supporters with a choice

 either they must consciously ignore
insights which become increasingly urgent or else they must suppress
their own moral instincts in order to be able to support with a good
conscience an economic system that serves only their own interests

 


without overestimating the efficacy of such ideological factors it must
be agreed that the fighting power of a class grows with its ability to
carry out its own mission with a good conscience and to adapt all
phenomena to its own interests with unbroken confidence in itself

 if we
consider sismondi s criticism of classical economics german criticisms
of natural law and the youthful critiques of carlyle it becomes evident
that from a very early stage the ideological history of the bourgeoisie
was nothing but a desperate resistance to every insight into the true
nature of the society it had created and thus to a real understanding of
its class situation

 when the communist manifesto makes the point that
the bourgeoisie produces its own gravediggers this is valid
ideologically as well as economically

 the whole of bourgeois thought in
the nineteenth century made the most strenuous efforts to mask the real
foundations of bourgeois society everything was tried from the
greatest falsifications of fact to the sublime theories about the
 essence of history and the state

 but in vain with the end of the
century the issue was resolved by the advances of science and their
corresponding effects on the consciousness of the capitalist elite



this can be seen very clearly in the bourgeoisie s greater readiness to
accept the idea of conscious organisation

 a greater measure of
concentration was achieved first in the stock companies and in the
cartels and trusts

 this process revealed the social character of
capital more and more clearly without affecting the general anarchy in
production

 what it did was to confer nearmonopoly status on a number
of giant individual capitalists

 objectively then the social character
of capital was brought into play with great energy but in such a manner
as to keep its nature concealed from the capitalist class

 indeed this
illusory elimination of economic anarchy successfully diverted their
attention from the true situation

 with the crises of the war and the
postwar period this tendency has advanced still further the idea of a
 planned economy has gained ground at least among the more progressive
elements of the bourgeoisie

 admittedly this applies only within quite
harrow strata of the bourgeoisie and even there it is thought of more as
a theoretical experiment than as a practical way out of the impasse
brought about by the crises



when capitalism was still expanding it rejected every sort of social
organisation on the grounds that it was “an inroad upon such sacred
things as the rights of property freedom and unrestricted play for the
initiative of the individual capitalist

” 36 if we compare that
with current attempts to harmonise a planned economy with the class
interests of the bourgeoisie we are forced to admit that what we are
witnessing is the capitulation of the class consciousness of the
bourgeoisie before that of the proletariat

 of course the section of the
bourgeoisie that accepts the notion of a planned economy does not mean
by it the same as does the proletariat it regards it as a last attempt
to save capitalism by driving its internal contradictions to
breakingpoint

 nevertheless this means jettisoning the last theoretical
line of defence

 as a strange counterpart to this we may note that at
just this point in time certain sectors of the proletariat capitulate
before the bourgeoisie and adopt this the most problematic form of
bourgeois organisation



with this the whole existence of the bourgeoisie and its culture is
plunged into the most terrible crisis

 on the one hand we find the
utter sterility of an ideology divorced from life of a more or less
conscious attempt at forgery

 on the other hand a cynicism no less
terribly jejune lives on in the worldhistorical irrelevances and
nullities of its own existence and concerns itself only with the defence
of that existence and with its own naked selfinterest

 this ideological
crisis is an unfailing sign of decay

 the bourgeoisie has already been
thrown on the defensive however aggressive its weapons may be it is
fighting for selfpreservation

 its power to dominate has vanished
beyond recall



4

in this struggle for consciousness historical materialism plays a
crucial role

 ideologically no less than economically the bourgeoisie
and the proletariat are mutually interdependent

 the same process that
the bourgeoisie experiences as a permanent crisis and gradual
dissolution appears to the proletariat likewise in crisisform as the
gathering of strength and the springboard to victory

 ideologically this
means that the same growth of insight into the nature of society which
reflects the protracted death struggle of the bourgeoisie entails a
steady growth in the strength of the proletariat

 for the proletariat
the truth is a weapon that brings victory and the more ruthless the
greater the victory

 this makes more comprehensible the desperate fury
with which bourgeois science assails historical materialism for as soon
as the bourgeoisie is forced to take up its stand on this terrain it is
lost

 and at the same time this explains why the proletariat and only
the proletariat can discern in the correct understanding of the nature
of society a powerfactor of the first and perhaps decisive importance



the unique function of consciousness in the class struggle of the
proletariat has consistently been overlooked by the vulgar marxists who
have substituted a petty realpolitik for the great battle of principle
which reaches back to the ultimate problems of the objective economic
process

 naturally we do not wish to deny that the proletariat must
proceed from the facts of a given situation

 but it is to be
distinguished from other classes by the fact that it goes beyond the
contingencies of history far from being driven forward by them it is
itself their driving force and impinges centrally upon the process of
social change

 when the vulgar marxists detach themselves from this
central point of view i

e

 from the point where a proletarian class
consciousness arises they thereby place themselves on the level of
consciousness of the bourgeoisie

 and that the bourgeoisie fighting on
its own ground will prove superior to the proletariat both economically
and ideologically can come as a surprise only to a vulgar marxist


moreover only a vulgar marxist would infer from this fact which after
all derives exclusively from his own attitude that the bourgeoisie
generally occupies the stronger position

 for quite apart from the very
real force at its disposal it is selfevident that the bourgeoisie
fighting on its own ground will be both more experienced and more
expert

 nor will it come as a surprise if the bourgeoisie automatically
obtains the upper hand when its opponents abandon their own position for
that of the bourgeoisie



as the bourgeoisie has the intellectual organisational and every other
advantage the superiority of the proletariat must lie exclusively in
its ability to see society from the centre as a coherent whole

 this
means that it is able to act in such a way as to change reality in the
class consciousness of the proletariat theory and practice coincide and
so it can consciously throw the weight of its actions onto the scales of
history – and this is the deciding factor

 when the vulgar marxists
destroy this unity they cut the nerve that binds proletarian theory to
proletarian action

 they reduce theory to the scientific treatment of
the symptoms of social change and as for practice they are themselves
reduced to being buffeted about aimlessly and uncontrollably by the
various elements of the process they had hoped to master



the class consciousness that springs from this position must exhibit the
same internal structure as that of the bourgeoisie

 but when the logic
of events drives the same dialectical contradictions to the surface of
consciousness the consequences for the proletariat are even more
disastrous than for the bourgeoisie

 for despite all the dialectical
contradictions despite all its objective falseness the selfdeceiving
 false consciousness that we find in the bourgeoisie is at least in
accord with its class situation

 it cannot save the bourgeoisie from the
constant exacerbation of these contradictions and so from destruction
but it can enable it to continue the struggle and even engineer
victories albeit of short duration



but in the case of the proletariat such a consciousness not only has to
overcome these internal bourgeois contradictions but it also
conflicts with the course of action to which the economic situation
necessarily commits the proletariat regardless of its own thoughts on
the subject

 the proletariat must act in a proletarian manner but its
own vulgar marxist theory blocks its vision of the right course to
adopt

 the dialectical contradiction between necessary proletarian
action and vulgar marxist bourgeois theory becomes more and more
acute

 as the decisive battle in the class struggle approaches the
power of a true or false theory to accelerate or retard progress grows
in proportion

 the realm of freedom the end of the prehistory of
mankind means precisely that the power of the objectified reified
relations between men begins to revert to man

 the closer this process
comes to it 1 s goal the more urgent it becomes for the proletariat to
understand its own historical mission and the more vigorously and
directly proletarian class consciousness will determine each of its
actions

 for the blind power of the forces at work will only advance
 automatically to their goal of selfannihilation as long as that goal
is not within reach

 when the moment of transition to the realm of
freedom arrives this will become apparent just because the blind forces
really will hurtle blindly towards the abyss and only the conscious
will of the proletariat will be able to save mankind from the impending
catastrophe

 in other words when the final economic crisis of
capitalism develops the fate of the revolution and with it the fate of
mankind will depend on the ideological maturity of the proletariat
i

e

 on its class consciousness



we have now determined the unique function of the class consciousness of
the proletariat in contrast to that of other classes

 the proletariat
cannot liberate itself as a class without simultaneously abolishing
class society as such

 for that reason its consciousness the last class
consciousness in the history of mankind must both lay bare the nature
of society and achieve an increasingly inward fusion of theory and
practice

 ideology for the proletariat is no banner to follow into
battle nor is it a cover for its true objectives it is the objective
and the weapon itself

 every nonprincipled or unprincipled use of
tactics on the part of the proletariat debases historical materialism to
the level of mere ideology and forces the proletariat to use bourgeois
or petty bourgeois tactics

 it thereby robs it of its greatest
strength by forcing class consciousness into the secondary or inhibiting
role of a bourgeois consciousness instead of the active role of a
proletarian consciousness



the relationship between class consciousness and class situation is
really very simple in the case of the proletariat but the obstacles
which prevent its consciousness being realised in practice are
correspondingly greater

 in the first place this consciousness is
divided within itself

 it is true that society as such is highly unified
and that it evolves in a unified manner

 but in a world where the
reified relations of capitalism have the appearance of a natural
environment it looks as if there is not a unity but a diversity of
mutually independent objects and forces

 the most striking division in
proletarian class consciousness and the one most fraught with
consequences is the separation of the economic struggle from the
political one

 marx repeatedly exposed 37 the fallacy of this split
and demonstrated that it is in the nature of every economic struggle to
develop into a political one and vice versa

 nevertheless it has not
proved possible to eradicate this heresy from the theory of the
proletariat

 the cause of this aberration is to be found in the
dialectical separation of immediate objectives and ultimate goal and
hence in the dialectical division within the proletarian revolution
itself



classes that successfully carried out revolutions in earlier societies
had their task made easier subjective by this very fact of the
discrepancy between their own class consciousness and the objective
economic setup i

e

 by their very unawareness of their own function in
the process of change

 they had only to use the power at their disposal
to enforce their immediate interests while the social import of their
actions was hidden from them and left to the ruse of reason of the
course of events



but as the proletariat has been entrusted by history with the task of
transforming social consciously its class consciousness must develop a
dialectical contradiction between its immediate interests and its
longterm objectives and between the discrete factors and the whole


for the discrete factor the concrete situation with its concrete
demands is by its very nature an integral part of the existing
capitalist society it is governed by the laws of that society and is
subject to its economic structure

 only when the immediate interests are
integrated into a total view and related to the final goal of the
process do they become revolutionary pointing concretely and
consciously beyond the confines of capitalist society



this means that subjectively i

e

 for the class consciousness of the
proletariat the dialectical relationship between immediate interests
and objective impact on the whole of society is loc in the consciousness
of the proletariat itself

 it does not work itself out as a purely
objective process quite apart from all imputed consciousness – as was
the case with all classes hitherto

 thus the revolutionary victory of
the proletariat does not imply as with former classes the immediate
realisation of the socially given existence of the class but as the
young marx clearly saw and defined its selfannihilation

 the communist
manifesto formulates this distinction in this way “all the preceding
classes that got the upper hand sought to fortify their already
acquired status by subjecting society at large to their conditions of
appropriation

 the proletarians cannot become masters of the productive
forces of society except by abolishing their own previous mode of
appropriation and thereby every other previous mode of appropriation

”
my italics



this inner dialectic makes it hard for the proletariat to develop its
class consciousness in opposition to that of the bourgeoisie which by
cultivating the crudest and most abstract kind of empiricism was able to
make do with a superficial view of the world

 whereas even when the
development of the proletariat was still at a very primitive stage it
discovered that one of the elementary rules of class warfare was to
advance beyond what was immediately given

 marx emphasises this as
early as his observations on the weavers uprising in silesia

 38
for because of its situation this contradiction is introduced directly
into the consciousness of the proletariat whereas the bourgeoisie from
its situation saw the contradictions confronting it as the outer limits
of its consciousness



conversely this contradiction means that false consciousness is
something very different for the proletariat than for every preceding
class

 even correct statements about particular situations or aspects of
the development of bourgeois class consciousness reveal when related to
the whole of society the limits of that consciousness and unmask its
 falseness 

 whereas the proletariat always aspires towards the truth
even in its false consciousness and in its substantive errors

 it is
sufficient here to recall the social criticism of the utopians or the
proletarian and revolutionary extension of ricardo s theory

 concerning
the latter engels places great emphasis on the fact that it is
“formally incorrect economically” but he adds at once “what is false
from a formal economic point of view can be true in the perspective of
world history







 behind the formal economic error may lie concealed a
very true economic content

” 39

only with the aid of this distinction can there be any resolution of the
contradiction in the class consciousness of the proletariat only with
its aid can that contradiction become a conscious f actor in history


for the objective aspiration towards truth which is immanent even in the
 false consciousness of the proletariat does not at all imply that this
aspiration can come to light without the active intervention of the
proletariat

 on the contrary the mere aspiration towards truth can only
strip off the veils of falseness and mature into historically
significant and socially revolutionary knowledge by the potentiating of
consciousness by conscious action and conscious selfcriticism

 such
knowledge would of course be unattainable were it not for the objective
aspiration and here we find confirmation of marx s dictum that mankind
only ever sets itself tasks which it can accomplish”

 40 but the
aspiration only yields the possibility

 the accomplishment can only be
the fruit of the conscious deeds of the proletariat



the dialectical cleavage in the consciousness of the proletariat is a
product of the same structure that makes the historical mission of the
proletariat possible by pointing forward and beyond the existing social
order

 in the case of the other classes we found an antagonism between
the class s selfinterest and that of society between individual deed
and social consequences

 this antagonism set an external limit to
consciousness

 here in the centre of proletarian class consciousness we
discover an antagonism between momentary interest and ultimate goal

 the
outward victory of the proletariat can only be achieved if this
antagonism is inwardly overcome



as we stressed in the motto to this essay the existence of this conflict
enables us to perceive that class consciousness is identical with
neither the psychological consciousness of individual members of the
proletariat nor with the masspsychological consciousness of the
proletariat as a whole but it is on the contrary the sense become
conscious of the historical role of the class

 this sense will
objectify itself in particular interests of the moment and it may only
be ignored at the price of allowing the proletarian class struggle to
slip back into the most primitive utopianism

 every momentary interest
may have either of two functions either it will be a step towards the
ultimate goal or else it will conceal it

 which of the two it will be
depends entirely upon the class consciousness of the proletariat and not
on victory or defeat in isolated skirmishes

 marx drew attention very
early on 41 to this danger which is particularly acute on the
economic tradeunion front “at the same time the working class ought
not to exaggerate to themselves the ultimate consequence s of these
struggles

 they ought not to forget that they are fighting with effects
but not with the causes of those effects

 

 

 that they are applying
palliatives not curing the malady

 they ought therefore not to be
exclusively absorbed in these unavoidable guerilla fights 

 

 

 instead
of simultaneously trying to cure it instead of using their organised
forces as a lever for the final emancipation of the working class that
is to say the ultimate abolition of the wages system



we see here the source of every kind of opportunism which begins always
with effects and not causes parts and not the whole symptoms and not
the thing itself

 it does not regard the particular interest and the
struggle to achieve it as a means of education for the final battle
whose outcome depends on closing the gap between the psychological
consciousness and the imputed one

 instead it regards the particular as
a valuable achievement in itself or at least as a step along the path
towards the ultimate goal

 in a word opportunism mistakes the actual
psychological state 0 consciousness of proletarians for the class
consciousness of the proletariat



the practical damage resulting from this confusion can be seen in the
great loss of unity and cohesiveness in proletarian praxis when compared
to the unity of the objective economic tendencies

 the superior strength
of true practical class consciousness lies in the ability to look
beyond the divisive symptoms of the economic process to the unity of the
total social system underlying it

 in the age of capitalism it is not
possible for the total system to become directly visible in external
phenomena

 for instance the economic basis of a world crisis is
undoubtedly unified and its coherence can be understood

 but its actual
appearance in time and space will take the form of a disparate
succession of events in different countries at different times and even
in different branches of industry in a number of countries



when bourgeois thought “transforms the different limbs of society into
so many separate societies” 42 it certainly commits a grave
theoretical error

 but the immediate practical consequences are
nevertheless in harmony with the interests of capitalism

 the
bourgeoisie is unable in theory to understand more than the details and
the symptoms of economic processes a failure which will ultimately
prove its undoing

 in the short term however it is concerned above
all to impose its mode of life upon the daytoday actions of the
proletariat

 in this respect and in this respect alone its superiority
in organisation is clearly visible while the wholly different
organisation of the proletariat its capacity for being organised as a
class cannot become effective



the further the economic crisis of capitalism advances the more clearly
this unity in the economic process becomes comprehensible in practice


it was there of course in socalled periods of normality too and was
therefore visible from the class standpoint of the proletariat but the
gap between appearance and ultimate reality was too great for that unity
to have any practical consequences for proletarian action



in periods of crisis the position is quite different

 the unity of the
economic process now moves within reach

 so much so that even capitalist
theory cannot remain wholly untouched by it though it can never fully
adjust to it

 in this situation the fate of the proletariat and hence
of the whole future of humanity hangs on whether or not it will take
the step that has now become objectively possible

 for even if the
particular symptoms of crisis appear separately according to country
branch of industry in the form of economic or political crisis
etc

 and even if in consequence the reflex of the crisis is fragmented
in the immediate psychological consciousness of the workers it is still
possible and necessary to advance beyond this consciousness

 and this is
instinctively felt to be a necessity by larger and larger sections of
the proletariat



opportunism had – as it seemed – merely served to inhibit the objective
tendency until the crisis became acute

 now however it adopts a course
directly opposed to it

 its aim now is to scotch the development of
proletarian class consciousness in its progress from that which is
merely given to that which conforms to the objective total process even
more it hopes to reduce the class consciousness of the proletariat to
the level of the psychologically given and thus to divert into the
opposite direction what had hitherto been the purely instinctive
tendency

 as long as the unification of proletarian class consciousness
was not a practical possibility this theory could – with some charity –
be regarded as a mere error

 but in this situation it takes on the
character of a conscious deception 

regardless of whether its advocates
are psychologically conscious of this or not

 in contrast with the
right instincts of the proletariat it plays the same role as that played
hitherto by capitalist theory it denounces the correct view of the
overall economic situation and the correct class consciousness of the
proletariat together with its organised form the communist party as
something unreal and inimical to the true interests of the workers
i

e

 their immediate national or professional interests and as
something alien to their genuine class consciousness i

e

 that which
is psychologically given



to say that class consciousness has no psychological reality does not
imply that it is a mere fiction

 its reality is vouched for by its
ability to explain the infinitely painful path of the proletarian
revolution with its many reverses its constant return to its
startingpoint and the incessant selfcriticism of which marx speaks in
the celebrated passage in the eighteenth brumaire



only the consciousness of the proletariat can point to the way that
leads out of the impasse of capitalism

 as long as this consciousness is
lacking the crisis remains permanent it goes back to its
startingpoint repeats the cycle until after infinite sufferings and
terrible detours the school of history completes the education of the
proletariat and confers upon it the leadership of mankind

 but the
proletariat is not given any choice

 as marx says it must become a
class not only “as against capital” but also “for itself” 43 that
is to say the class struggle must be raised from the level of economic
necessity to the level of conscious aim and effective class
consciousness

 the pacifists and humanitarians of the class struggle
whose efforts tend whether they will or no to retard this lengthy
painful and crisisridden process would be horrified if they could but
see what sufferings they inflict on the proletariat by extending this
course of education

 but the proletariat cannot abdicate its mission


the only question at issue is how much it has to suffer before it
achieves ideological maturity before it acquires a true understanding
of its class situation and a true class consciousness



of course this uncertainty and lack of clarity are themselves the
symptoms of the crisis in bourgeois society

 as the product of
capitalism the proletariat must necessarily be subject to the modes of
existence of its creator

 this mode of existence is inhumanity and
reification

 no doubt the very existence of the proletariat implies
criticism and the negation of this form of life

 but until the objective
crisis of capitalism has matured and until the proletariat has achieved
true class consciousness and the ability to understand the crisis
fully it cannot go beyond the criticism of reification and so it is
only negatively superior to its antagonist

 indeed if it can do no more
than negate some aspects of capitalism if it cannot at least aspire to
a critique of the whole then it will not even achieve a negative
superiority

 this applies to the pettybourgeois attitudes of most trade
unionists

 such criticism from the standpoint of capitalism can be seen
most strikingly in the separation of the various theatres of war

 the
bare fact of separation itself indicates that the consciousness of the
proletariat is still fettered by reification

 and if the proletariat
finds the economic inhumanity to which it is subjected easier to
understand than the political and the political easier than the
cultural then all these separations point to the extent of the still
unconquered power of capitalist forms of life in the proletariat itself



the reified consciousness must also remain hopelessly trapped in the two
extremes of crude empiricism and abstract utopianism

 in the one case
consciousness becomes either a completely passive observer moving in
obedience to laws which it can never control

 in the other it regards
itself as a power which is able of its own – subjective – volition to
master the essentially meaningless motion of objects

 we have already
identified the crude empiricism of the opportunists in its relation to
proletarian class consciousness

 we must now go on to see utopianism as
characteristic of the internal divisions within class consciousness


the separation of empiricism from utopianism undertaken here for purely
methodological reasons should not be taken as an admission that the two
cannot occur together in particular trends and even individuals

 on the
contrary they are frequently found together and are joined by an
internal bond



the philosophical efforts of the young marx were largely directed
towards the refutation of the various false theories of consciousness
including both the idealism of the hegelian school and the
 materialism of feuerbach and towards the discovery of a correct view
of the role of consciousness in history

 as early as the correspondence
of 1843 with ruge he conceives of consciousness as immanent in
history

 consciousness does not lie outside the real process of history


it does not have to be introduced into the world by philosophers
therefore to gaze down arrogantly upon the petty struggles of the world
and to despise them is indefensible

 “we only show it the world what
its struggles are about and consciousness is a thing that it must needs
acquire whether it will or not

” what is needed then is only “to explain
its own actions to it”

 44 the great polemic against hegel in the
holy family concentrates mainly on this point

 45 hegel s
inadequacy is that he only seems to allow the absolute spirit to make
history

 the resulting otherworldliness of consciousness visàvis the
real events of history becomes in the hands of hegel s disciples an
arrogant – and reactionary confrontation of spirit and mass 

 marx
mercilessly exposes the flaws and absurdities and the reversions to a
prehegelian stage implicit in this approach



complementing this is his – aphoristic – critique of feuerbach

 the
materialists had elaborated a view of consciousness as of something
appertaining to this world

 marx sees it as merely one stage in the
process the stage of bourgeois society 

 he opposes to it the notion
of consciousness as practical critical activity with the task of
 changing the world 



this provides us with the philosophical foundation we need to settle
accounts with the utopians

 for their thought contains this very duality
of social process and the consciousness of it

 consciousness approaches
society from another world and leads it from

 the false path it has
followed back to the right one

 the utopians are prevented by the
undeveloped nature of the proletarian movement from seeing the true
bearer of historical movement in history itself in the way the
proletariat organises itself as a class and hence in the class
consciousness of the proletariat

 they are not yet able to “take note of
what is happening before their very eyes and to become its mouthpiece”


46

it would be foolish to believe that this criticism and the recognition
that a postutopian attitude to history has become objectively possible
means that utopianism can be dismissed as a factor in the proletariat s
struggle for freedom

 this is true only for those stages of class
consciousness that have really achieved the unity of theory and practice
described by marx the real and practical intervention of class
consciousness in the course of history and hence the practical
understanding of reification

 and this did not all happen at a single
stroke and in a coherent manner

 for there are not merely national and
 social stages involved but there are also gradations within the class
consciousness of workers in the same strata

 the separation of economics
from politics is the most revealing and also the most important instance
of this

 it appears that some sections of the proletariat have quite the
right instincts as far as the economic struggle goes and can even raise
them to the level of class consciousness

 at the same time however
when it comes to political questions they manage to persist in a
completely utopian point of view

 it does not need to be emphasised that
there is no question here of a mechanical duality

 the utopian view of
the function of politics must impinge dialectically on their views about
economics and in particular on their notions about the economy as a
totality as for example in the syndicalist theory of revolution

 in
the absence of a real understanding of the interaction between politics
and economics a war against the whole economic system to say nothing of
its reorganisation is quite out of the question



the influence enjoyed even today by such completely utopian theories as
those of ballod or of guildsocialism shows the extent to which utopian
thought is still prevalent even at a level where the direct
lifeinterests of the proletariat are most nearly concerned and where
the present crisis makes it possible to read off from history the
correct course of action to be followed



this syndrome must make its appearance even more blatantly where it is
not yet possible to see society is a whole

 this can be seen at its
clearest in purely ideological questions in questions of culture

 these
questions occupy an almost wholly isolated position in the consciousness
of the proletariat the organic bonds connecting these issues with the
immediate lifeinterests of the proletariat as well as with society as a
whole have not even begun to penetrate its consciousness

 the
achievement in this area hardly ever goes beyond the selfcriticism of
capitalism – carried out here by the proletariat

 what is positive here
in theory and practice is almost entirely utopian



these gradations are then on the one hand objective historical
necessities nuances in the objective possibilities of consciousness
such as the relative cohesiveness of politics and economics in
comparison to cultural questions

 on the other hand where
consciousness already exists as an objective possibility they indicate
degrees of distance between the psychological class consciousness and
the adequate understanding of the total situation

 these gradations
however can no longer be referred back to socioeconomic causes

 the
objective theory of class consciousness is the theory of its objective
possibility

 the stratification of the problems and economic interests
within the proletariat is unfortunately almost wholly unexplored but
research would undoubtedly lead to discoveries of the very first
importance

 but however useful it would be to produce a typology of the
various strata we would still be confronted at every turn with the
problem of whether it is actually possible to make the objective
possibility of class consciousness into a reality

 hitherto this
question could only occur to extraordinary individuals consider marx s
completely nonutopian prescience with regard to the problems of
dictatorship

 today it has become a real and relevant question for a
whole class the question of the inner transformation of the
proletariat of its development to the stage of its own objective
historical mission

 it is an ideological crisis which must be solved
before a practical solution to the world s economic crisis can be found



in view of the great distance that the proletariat has to travel
ideologically it would be disastrous to foster any illusions

 but it
would be no less disastrous to overlook the forces at work within the
proletariat which are tending towards the ideological defeat of
capitalism

 every proletarian revolution has created workers councils
in an increasingly radical and conscious manner

 when this weapon
increases in power to the point where it becomes the organ of state
this is a sign that the class consciousness of the proletariat is on the
verge of overcoming the bourgeois outlook of its leaders



the revolutionary workers council not to be confused with its
opportunist caricatures is one of the forms which the consciousness of
the proletariat has striven to create ever since its inception

 the fact
that it exists and is constantly developing shows that the proletariat
already stands on the threshold of its own consciousness and hence on
the threshold of victory

 the workers council spells the political and
economic defeat of reification

 in the period following the dictatorship
it will eliminate the bourgeois separation of the legislature
administration and judiciary

 during the struggle for control its
mission is twofold

 on the one hand it must overcome the fragmentation
of the proletariat in time and space and on the other it has to bring
economics and politics together into the true synthesis of proletarian
praxis

 in this way it will help to reconcile the dialectical conflict
between immediate interests and ultimate goal



thus we must never overlook the distance that separates the
consciousness of even the most revolutionary worker from the authentic
class consciousness of the proletariat

 but even this situation can be
explained on the basis of the marxist theory of class struggle and class
consciousness

 the proletariat only perfects itself by annihilating and
transcending itself by creating the classless society through the
successful conclusion of its own class struggle

 the struggle for this
society in which the dictatorship of the proletariat is merely a phase
is not just a battle waged against an external enemy the bourgeoisie


it is equally the struggle of the proletariat against itself

 against
the devastating and degrading effects of the capitalist system upon its
class consciousness

 the proletariat will only have won the real victory
when it has overcome these effects within itself

 the separation of the
areas that should be united the diverse stages of consciousness which
the proletariat has reached in the various spheres of activity are a
precise index of what has been achieved and what remains to be done

 the
proletariat must not shy away from selfcriticism for victory can only
be gained by the truth and selfcriticism must therefore be its
natural element
