'Conscience' vs. 'Conscious': Let Us Be Your Guide

   Avoiding confusion involves grammar and 'science'

     What to Know

     Though they sound similar, conscience is a noun referring to the
     awareness that one's actions are right or wrong, as in one's "guilty
     conscience," while conscious is an adjective meaning "awake" or
     "alert." If you were asleep you would be "unconscious." To keep them
     straight, remember to stay conscious of what your conscience is
     telling you to do.

   As conscientious lexicographers, we are conscious of the occasional
   mix-up of the words conscience and conscious. Here are some examples
   that caught our attention:

     The stones are an iconic part of Roman history. … Some tourists have
     been known to wrongly remove them from the street and take them home
     as a souvenir. Two years ago, a traveler with a very guilty
     conscious mailed back a stone they had stolen on vacation a year
     earlier, writing, "Please find enclosed a cobble from one of your
     cobbled roads."

     Covergirl is paving the way for larger and more well-known makeup
     brands to switch over to being cruelty-free…. Covergirl is not only
     affordable and a popular drugstore brand but now it comes with a
     clear conscious when picking their products off of the shelves.

     Communication is a fascinating and important topic. Be sure that you
     are clearly communicating by being conscience of your body language.
     — Forbes, 26 Feb. 2013

     As the price of electricity continues to rise, homeowners are
     looking for ways to cut energy costs without sacrificing comfort or
     convenience. And many cost-conscience homeowners are considering
     solar panels, which convert the sun's energy into clean electricity.

   If you stopped to double-check if conscience or conscious was actually
   being used incorrectly in any of the above examples, this article will
   help you to readily differentiate the words and use them with
   confidence in the future—since, honestly, there were no trick examples.
   And if wrongly using conscience in place of conscious, or vice versa,
   has never been on your conscience, we encourage you to read on anyways.
   We discuss word history and grammar, and an orthopteran insect.

   It's our moral obligation to help.

   Conscience and conscious derive from the same Latin roots—the prefix
   com- ("with," "together," "jointly") and the verb scire ("to know"),
   and the combination, conscire, means "to be aware of guilt"—and both
   relate to a state of awareness, the first of a moral awareness and the
   second of a physical or mental wakefulness in which a person is aware
   of their surroundings. English speakers are first made aware of
   conscience in the 13th century, and conscious in the 16th.

   Conscience and conscious have similar pronunciations, which, for some,
   causes confusion. (Their first syllables are pronounced the same, and
   they both contain a middle \sh\ sound.) For those who hesitate on which
   to use, learning the words' suffixes and their meanings and also the
   words' parts of speech might be the best approach in differentiating
   them. Conscience, having the noun suffix -ence, meaning "quality or
   state," is, well, a noun, and conscious, having the adjective suffix
   -ous, meaning "having," is an adjective.

What Does Conscience Mean?

   The noun conscience refers to a state of awareness or a sense that
   one's actions or intentions are either morally right or wrong, along
   with a feeling of obligation to do the right thing. Cartoons often
   personify the conscience as a proverbial angel/devil pair who talk into
   the ear of an indecisive character, encouraging him or her to follow
   either a path of moral virtue or of moral corruption. In the Walt
   Disney movie Pinocchio, metaphorically, the conscience is the dapper
   talking cricket, named Jiminy Cricket, whose maxim "always let your
   conscience be your guide" he teaches the title character, a marionette
   who is magically brought to life and becomes a real human boy after
   proving himself brave, truthful, and selfless (after listening to his
   conscience). Some examples of the noun conscience are:

     You should decide what to do according to your own conscience.

     Her conscience was bothering her, so she finally told the truth.

     I cannot do anything that is/goes against my conscience.

     He could not in good conscience allow this situation to continue.

     I have to tell you the truth because I don't want this on my
     conscience any longer.

What Does Conscious Mean

   Conscious, on the other hand, is an adjective that indicates that a
   person is awake and alert and able to understand what is happening
   around them, such as a patient who becomes fully conscious after being
   administered anesthesia. It can also imply that a person is aware of a
   particular fact or feeling, such as an investor who is conscious of
   risk or athletes who are conscious of being role models for young
   people. Another common meaning of conscious describes a person who
   cares about something specified, such as the cost-conscious shopper and
   the environmentally conscious activist. Additionally, conscious can
   modify an act or decision that is done deliberately (and one that might
   very well result in conscious guilt or a guilty conscience).

   Hopefully, you are now fully (or at least semi-) conscious of the
   differences in using conscience and conscious—the most essential one
   being that conscience is a noun and conscious is an adjective, which
   describes nouns. Keep in mind that whenever you are in a difficult
   situation, you should be conscious about what your conscience is
   telling you. Your conscience will help you make moral, just, and fair
   decisions. As for remembering the spelling of the noun: conscience
   contains the word science (also a noun), and as science tells us how
   the forces of nature and the universe behave—or should—the conscience
   tells us how we should behave—or should.
