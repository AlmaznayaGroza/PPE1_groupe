it s our moral obligation to help



conscience and conscious derive from the same latin roots—the prefix
com with together jointly and the verb scire to know and
the combination conscire means to be aware of guilt—and both relate
to a state of awareness the first of a moral awareness and the second
of a physical or mental wakefulness in which a person is aware of their
surroundings

 english speakers are first made aware of conscience in the
13th century and conscious in the 16th



conscience and conscious have similar pronunciations which for some
causes confusion

 their first syllables are pronounced the same and
they both contain a middle sh sound

 for those who hesitate on which
to use learning the words suffixes and their meanings and also the
words parts of speech might be the best approach in differentiating
them

 conscience having the noun suffix ence meaning quality or
state is well a noun and conscious having the adjective suffix
ous meaning having is an adjective



what does conscience mean



the noun conscience refers to a state of awareness or a sense that one s
actions or intentions are either morally right or wrong along with a
feeling of obligation to do the right thing

 cartoons often personify
the conscience as a proverbial angeldevil pair who talk into the ear of
an indecisive character encouraging him or her to follow either a path
of moral virtue or of moral corruption

 in the walt disney movie
pinocchio metaphorically the conscience is the dapper talking cricket
named jiminy cricket whose maxim always let your conscience be your
guide he teaches the title character a marionette who is magically
brought to life and becomes a real human boy after proving himself
brave truthful and selfless after listening to his conscience

 some
examples of the noun conscience are

 you should decide what to do according to your own conscience



 her conscience was bothering her so she finally told the truth



 i cannot do anything that isgoes against my conscience



 he could not in good conscience allow this situation to continue



 i have to tell you the truth because i don t want this on my
 conscience any longer



what does conscious mean

conscious on the other hand is an adjective that indicates that a
person is awake and alert and able to understand what is happening
around them such as a patient who becomes fully conscious after being
administered anesthesia

 it can also imply that a person is aware of a
particular fact or feeling such as an investor who is conscious of risk
or athletes who are conscious of being role models for young people


another common meaning of conscious describes a person who cares about
something specified such as the costconscious shopper and the
environmentally conscious activist

 additionally conscious can modify
an act or decision that is done deliberately and one that might very
well result in conscious guilt or a guilty conscience



hopefully you are now fully or at least semi conscious of the
differences in using conscience and conscious—the most essential one
being that conscience is a noun and conscious is an adjective which
describes nouns

 keep in mind that whenever you are in a difficult
situation you should be conscious about what your conscience is telling
you

 your conscience will help you make moral just and fair decisions


as for remembering the spelling of the noun conscience contains the
word science also a noun and as science tells us how the forces of
nature and the universe behave—or should—the conscience tells us how we
should behave—or should
