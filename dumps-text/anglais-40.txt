   What Is Freedom of Conscience, and Why Does It Matter?

   What is “conscience”? It’s a word we’re all familiar with—a clear
   conscience, a guilty conscience—even if we can’t pinpoint an exact
   definition.

   The concept pops up in all kinds of places. In Saturday morning
   cartoons where good guys consult an angel on their right shoulder
   (conscience) and a devil on their left shoulder (temptation) before
   making a decision. In literary masterpieces like Crime and Punishment,
   where the main character suffers from overwhelming guilt after
   committing a crime. And in popular movies like Star Wars where Darth
   Vader chooses to do one final good act after a lifetime of evil.

   But none of these examples capture the full concept of conscience. As
   Americans, we should consider the true meaning of “conscience.” We
   should also recognize the importance—and privilege—of having the
   freedom of conscience. America was founded on this freedom. And it’s
   worth preserving today.

   Read on to find out why.

What is freedom of conscience?

   Conscience is our God-given ability to discern right from wrong, good
   from evil. But it’s more than that. For knowing right from wrong
   wouldn’t do much good if we didn’t (or couldn’t) act on what’s right.
   So conscience also includes the ability to apply laws, rules, and
   intuitions in the right way. In other words, to act on what we believe.

   public witness. We can put our faith in action by serving others.

Where is freedom of conscience found in the Constitution?

   America’s Founders understood the gravity of protecting the freedom of
   conscience.

   James Madison called conscience “the most sacred of all property.”
   Thomas Jefferson said that no “provision in our constitution ought to
   be dearer to man, than that which protects the rights of conscience
   against” the government. And during the debate over what would become
   the First Amendment, many lawmakers proposed protecting the rights of
   conscience.

   This understanding shaped the First Amendment. Although the amendment
   doesn’t explicitly mention “conscience,” it protects its animating
   features: religious freedom and free speech. The First Amendment says,
   “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
   prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
   speech, or of the press.”

Why is freedom of conscience important?

   These 26 words protect the freedom of conscience—the freedom to believe
   without coercion and to speak and act consistently with those beliefs.

   That freedom begins internally: the government cannot force us to act
   contrary to our beliefs, believe what we otherwise wouldn’t, or to say
   things to which we object. So we have the freedom to think, reason,
   speak, stay silent about, and hold certain beliefs without fearing
   government punishment. That protects our private conscience.

   But our internal beliefs often move us to act publicly. So the First
   Amendment also protects our public witness. We can put our faith in
   action by serving others. We can try to persuade others of our views by
   publicly expressing them. And we can join communities of people—like
   churches, nonprofits, and other associations—that share our beliefs.

   The First Amendment also protects the freedom to act in several ways.
   Religious freedom ensures a private sphere within which religious
   bodies may govern themselves and instruct their congregants according
   to their own beliefs. That freedom preserves the integrity of those
   beliefs for future generations.

   And the freedom of speech recognizes that voices are often louder when
   expressed together. So we can join with like-minded people to amplify
   the messages and values we want to promote.

   It may be easy to take these freedoms for granted. But not every
   country has them. Consider France, a country that generally discourages
   acts and symbols of faith in the public sphere. There, for example,
   Muslim girls cannot wear religious head coverings in school, but other
   girls can wear head scarfs for fashion. In France, that’s laïcité. In
   America, that’s religious discrimination.

   The freedom to act on our beliefs is important because community
   standards—or lack thereof—reflect individuals’ conscience. The more we
   train our conscience to do what is right, the better off we will be.
   But we lose our ability to discern right from wrong the more we
   consistently ignore our conscience.

   The freedom of conscience has also benefitted America’s common good.
   Because of this freedom, religious organizations have founded and
   currently operate countless hospitals, homeless shelters, adoption
   agencies, community centers, and other public services. Pastors have
   condemned social ills like racism and violence. And religious people
   are more likely to volunteer their time and contribute their money to
   all sorts of charitable causes (religious and secular alike).

What are some court cases dealing with freedom of conscience?

   The freedom of conscience is worth preserving. Several court cases seek
   to do (and have done) just that. Consider three contexts:

   1. The freedom of artists to speak according to their beliefs.

   2. The freedom of medical providers to decline to provide medical
   procedures that violate their conscience.

   3. The freedom of faith-based public-service ministries to operate in
   line with their religious purpose.

Freedom of conscience for artists

   For almost eighty years, the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized that
   compelling someone to express a message they disagree with is
   unconstitutional. Even so, artists are still being threatened today for
   declining to convey ideas that violate their beliefs.

   For example, Jack Phillips of Masterpiece Cakeshop has been targeted
   three times for declining to create custom cakes that promote ideas
   about human sexuality that he doesn’t believe. Jack’s first case ended
   in a major victory at the U.S. Supreme Court. More recently, Jack won
   another victory when the Colorado Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit
   brought against him.

   ADF also represented graphic artist and website designer Lorie Smith at
   the Supreme Court in 303 Creative v. Elenis. Lorie runs 303 Creative, a
   website design studio. She creates beautiful, original digital designs
   to promote messages she’s passionate about and wants to expand to
   include custom websites that celebrate marriages between one man and
   one woman.

   But Lorie lives in Colorado. And Colorado was trying to misuse one of
   its laws to force her to create websites promoting messages that
   contradict her beliefs about marriage. Unwilling to violate the law or
   her conscience, Lorie challenged the law to protect the cherished
   freedom to speak consistently with her religious views on marriage.

   In June 2023, the Supreme Court ruled that Colorado could not use its
   law to coerce Lorie to express a message that violated her beliefs. The
   Court said that the First Amendment protects Lorie’s freedom to decide
   which messages she wants to express, and that includes the freedom to
   design wedding websites consistent with her religious beliefs about
   marriage.

   Elsewhere across the country, artists as diverse as florists and custom
   print shops have been forced to choose between their faith and their
   craft, just as Colorado tried to force Lorie to do. But fortunately,
   the First Amendment makes that choice a false dichotomy.

   Following the First Amendment, courts have protected the freedoms of
   filmmakers, calligraphers, and a photographer to create artwork
   proclaiming their views on marriage. Another court likewise ensured
   that a Christian philosophy professor could talk about gender identity
   consistent with his belief about the immutability of sex. Lorie’s
   victory reaffirms that the Supreme Court still believes in the
   importance of a free conscience. That’s how it should be. Every
   American has the right to speak freely. That’s why Lorie found support
   from a diverse group of artists—from a world-renowned graphic designer
   to a Christian tattoo artist, a Muslim wedding photographer, and a cake
   artist who hold different views about marriage.

Freedom of conscience for health-care professionals

   Beyond speech, the freedom of conscience is imperative in the medical
   field. Since ancient times, physicians have sworn to “do no harm” to
   their patients. Fast forward to present day, and professional medical
   ethics acknowledge the rights of professionals to decline to provide
   medical treatment that violates their conscience.

   The justification echoes the First Amendment—to preserve the personal
   integrity of the medical provider and the overall integrity of the
   medical profession. But not everyone sees it that way.

   In Christian Healthcare Centers v. Nessel, for example, ADF represents
   a Michigan faith-based medical nonprofit organization that provides
   high-quality health care to all and offers substantially reduced prices
   for patients with lower incomes. But a Michigan law requires Christian
   Healthcare to prescribe cross-sex hormones to facilitate efforts to
   alter a patient’s biological sex. Doing so violates the ministry’s
   religious beliefs and undermines its ability to provide safe health
   care to its community. So the ministry challenged the law to safeguard
   its freedom to operate consistent with its beliefs.

   Likewise, in State of Texas and Mayo Pharmacy v. HHS, ADF represents
   Mayo Pharmacy, a pharmacy in North Dakota that practices consistent
   with its Catholic faith. The pharmacy is challenging a regulation that
   requires it to dispense drugs prescribed to induce abortions against
   its religious convictions. In July 2023, a federal district court ruled
   that the case must proceed.

Freedom of conscience for faith-based ministries

   The freedom of conscience allows faith-based ministries to provide
   other public services to care for the most vulnerable among us. For
   example, ADF has twice defended Downtown Hope Center, a Christian
   nonprofit organization in Anchorage, Alaska. The Hope Center offers
   meals, job training, and clothing for homeless men and women and serves
   as an overnight shelter for women—many of whom are trying to escape
   from abusive situations and even from sex trafficking.

   And ADF represented New Hope Family Services in New York. For almost
   sixty years, New Hope has helped to place more than 1,000 children into
   loving adoptive homes throughout the state. It does so because of its
   religious conviction that Christians are called to look after the
   needy—especially children. A court recently protected New Hope’s
   ability to continue to care for these children and their families
   according to its religious beliefs.

   These ministries provide critical services to their communities. And
   they do so because of their religious beliefs. This is a common feature
   of American history made possible by the freedom of conscience. In that
   way, protecting the ability of these ministries to live out their faith
   ensures that other religious organizations can do the same while
   contributing to the common good.

Conclusion

   By now, we’ve answered the original question—what is conscience? And
   we’ve answered another— why is freedom of conscience worth preserving?

   In the end, this freedom recognizes the inherent dignity of each person
   as created in God’s image and endowed with the God-given capacity to
   make moral judgments. We all benefit from that freedom.
