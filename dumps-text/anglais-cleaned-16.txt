types of conscience

text 1 timothy 15

one of the goals of preachingteaching the word of god is a “good
conscience

” our conscience is designed to help guide us to do what is
right “right” depends on how it is trained

 if we want to accomplish
this goal we need to understand more about the conscience

 there are at
least six different types of conscience addressed in the new testament


we will consider them here



good conscience

 a good conscience is one which is free from guilt – we are doing
 what we believe to be right used two different ways in the nt of
 those who did right and those who did wrong
 those who do right are to have a good conscience 1 timothy 15 –
 keep a good conscience 1 timothy 119 if we follow god we can
 have confidence not fear 1 john 321 22829
 however it is possible to do wrong and have a good conscience acts
 231 – paul did many things against christ acts 26911 1 timothy
 11315 he believed he was right acts 2416
 many have a good conscience because they do what “seems right” to
 them proverbs 1412 – but this is not enough

defiled conscience

 a defiled conscience is one which causes one to feel guilt for doing
 what is either right or innocent – right is something required by
 god 2 timothy 31617 innocent is not right or wrong in itself
 romans 1423
 in corinth some had a defiled conscience 1 corinthians 87 – much
 of the meat sold in the markets in corinth had been used previously
 in idol worship paul explained that buyingeating it did not
 constitute participation in idolatry 1 corinthians 846
 however those “accustomed to the idol” could not separate the idol
 worship from eating 1 corinthians 87 – for them to eat would
 violate their conscience and embolden them to sin 1 corinthians
 81011 cf

 romans 1423
 if one has a defiled conscience they need to be patiently taught
 the truth romans 141 cf

 acts 1826

seared conscience

 a seared conscience is one that no longer feels guilt for sin –
 whether one followed the right or wrong standard it is a conscience
 that has been violated so many times that it no longer works
 the spirit warned of those who would fall away due to a seared
 conscience 1 timothy 412 – when one sins godly sorrow leads him
 to repentance 2 corinthians 710 feels guilty wants to be right
 but when sin becomes persistent and habitual guilt is no longer
 there genesis 65 jeremiah 615
 a seared conscience is prevented by laying aside sin hebrews 121
 rather than continuing in it 2 timothy 313 – if one has a seared
 conscience little can be done until they have a change of heart
 hebrews 646

weak conscience

 a weak conscience is one that has simply not been trained in what is
 right – lacks knowledge from god that provides the right standard
 in corinth a weak conscience led to a defiled conscience 1
 corinthians 87 – lacked knowledge one can have a weak conscience
 and also have a good conscience acts 231 1 timothy 113
 the remedy for a weak conscience is training in the word of god
 hebrews 514

evil conscience

 an evil conscience is one that has not been forgiven of sin hebrews
 1022
 all have had an evil conscience at some point romans 323 –
 forgiveness is found in christ hebrews 914 ephesians 17 this
 cleanses the evil conscience

clear pure conscience

 a clear pure kjv conscience is one that has been forgiven 1
 timothy 39 – cleansed by christ this is the good conscience of
 those who do right 1 timothy 15 19 1 peter 316
 we cannot purify our conscience on our own – must appeal to god to
 do it 1 peter 321
 god cleanses us when we obey the gospel romans 634 – continues
 to as we obey 1 john 17

conclusion

 the goal of our instruction is a “good conscience” – but goodness is
 by god s standard not man s
 it is not enough for us to think we are doing what is right – we
 must actually be right involves knowledge obedience and
 forgiveness
 we can have “our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience”
 hebrews 1022 – done in baptism appeal for a good conscience 1
 peter 321 receive forgiveness acts 2216
