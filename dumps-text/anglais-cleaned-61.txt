measure of arousal other than normal

this article is about the medical concept

 for the psychological
concept see altered state of consciousness



medical condition

 
 altered level of consciousness 
 
 an intracranial hemorrhage one cause of altered level of consciousness 
 specialty psychiatry neurology
 

an altered level of consciousness is any measure of arousal other than
normal

 level of consciousness loc is a measurement of a person s
arousability and responsiveness to stimuli from the environment

1 a
mildly depressed level of consciousness or alertness may be classed as
lethargy someone in this state can be aroused with little
difficulty

1 people who are obtunded have a more depressed level of
consciousness and cannot be fully aroused

12 those who are not
able to be aroused from a sleeplike state are said to be
stuporous

12 coma is the inability to make any purposeful
response

12 scales such as the glasgow coma scale have been
designed to measure the level of consciousness



an altered level of consciousness can result from a variety of factors
including alterations in the chemical environment of the brain e

g


exposure to poisons or intoxicants insufficient oxygen or blood flow
in the brain and excessive pressure within the skull

 prolonged
unconsciousness is understood to be a sign of a medical emergency

3
a deficit in the level of consciousness suggests that both of the
cerebral hemispheres or the reticular activating system have been
injured

4 a decreased level of consciousness correlates to
increased morbidity sickness and mortality death

5 thus it is a
valuable measure of a patient s medical and neurological status

 in
fact some sources consider level of consciousness to be one of the
vital signs

36

definition

edit

scales and terms to classify the levels of consciousness differ but in
general reduction in response to stimuli indicates an altered level of
consciousness

 
 level summary kruse2 description
 metaconscious preternatural people who possess the ability to monitor and control their own cognitive processes in addition to meeting all the criteria indicative of a normal level of consciousness

 in the field of cognitive neuroscience metacognitive monitoring and control have been viewed as functions of the prefrontal cortex which receives sensory input signals from divergent cortical regions and implements control through feedback loops which are established utilizing the underlying mechanisms of neuroplasticity see chapters by schwartz bacon and shimamura in dunlosky bjork 2008

7
 conscious normal assessment of loc involves checking orientation people who are able promptly and spontaneously to state their name location and the date or time are said to be oriented to self place and time or oriented x3

8 a normal sleep stage from which a person is easily awakened is also considered a normal level of consciousness

9 clouding of consciousness is a term for a mild alteration of consciousness with alterations in attention and wakefulness

9
 confused disoriented impaired thinking and responses people who do not respond quickly with information about their name location and the time are considered obtuse or confused

8 a confused person may be bewildered disoriented and have difficulty following instructions

9 the person may have slow thinking and possible memory time loss

 this could be caused by sleep deprivation malnutrition allergies environmental pollution drugs prescription and nonprescription and infection


 delirious disoriented restlessness hallucinations sometimes delusions some scales have delirious below this level in which a person may be restless or agitated and exhibit a marked deficit in attention

2
 somnolent sleepy a somnolent person shows excessive drowsiness and responds to stimuli only with incoherent mumbles or disorganized movements

8
 obtunded decreased alertness slowed psychomotor responses in obtundation a person has a decreased interest in their surroundings slowed responses and sleepiness

9
 stuporous sleeplike state not unconscious littleno spontaneous activity people with an even lower level of consciousness stupor only respond by grimacing or drawing away from painful stimuli

8
 comatose cannot be aroused no response to stimuli comatose people do not even make this response to stimuli have no corneal or gag reflex and they may have no pupillary response to light

 levels of consciousness

altered level of consciousness is sometimes described as altered
sensorium



glasgow coma scale

edit

main article glasgow coma scale

the most commonly used tool for measuring loc objectively is the glasgow
coma scale gcs

 it has come into almost universal use for assessing
people with brain injury2 or an altered level of consciousness


verbal motor and eyeopening responses to stimuli are measured
scored and added into a final score on a scale of 3–15 with a lower
score being a more decreased level of consciousness

others

edit

the avpu scale is another means of measuring loc people are assessed to
determine whether they are alert responsive to verbal stimuli
responsive to painful stimuli or unresponsive

36 to determine
responsiveness to voice a caregiver speaks to or failing that yells
at the person

3 responsiveness to pain is determined with a mild
painful stimulus such as a pinch moaning or withdrawal from the
stimulus is considered a response to pain

3 the acdu scale like
avpu is easier to use than the gcs and produces similarly accurate
results

10 using acdu a patient is assessed for alertness
confusion drowsiness and unresponsiveness

10

the grady coma scale classes people on a scale of i to v along a scale
of confusion stupor deep stupor abnormal posturing and coma

9

pathophysiology

edit

although the neural science behind alertness wakefulness and arousal
are not fully known the reticular formation is known to play a role in
these

9 the ascending reticular activating system is a postulated
group of neural connections that receives sensory input and projects to
the cerebral cortex through the midbrain and thalamus from the reticular
formation

9 since this system is thought to modulate wakefulness
and sleep interference with it such as injury illness or metabolic
disturbances could alter the level of consciousness

9

normally stupor and coma are produced by interference with the brain
stem such as can be caused by a lesion or indirect effects such as
brain herniation

9 mass lesions in the brain stem normally cause
coma due to their effects on the reticular formation

11 mass
lesions that occur above the tentorium cerebelli normally do not
significantly alter the level of consciousness unless they are very
large or affect both cerebral hemispheres

9

diagnosis

edit

assessing loc involves determining an individual s response to external
stimuli

12 speed and accuracy of responses to questions and
reactions to stimuli such as touch and pain are noted

12 reflexes
such as the cough and gag reflexes are also means of judging
loc

12 once the level of consciousness is determined clinicians
seek clues for the cause of any alteration

9 usually the first
tests in the er are pulse oximetry to determine if there is hypoxia
serum glucose levels to rule out hypoglycemia

 a urine drug screen may
be sent

 a ct head is very important to obtain to rule out bleed

 in
cases where meningitis is suspected a lumbar puncture must be
performed

 a serum tsh is an important test to order

 in select groups
consider vitamin b12 levels

 checking serum ammonia is particularly
advised in neonatal coma to discern inborn errors of
metabolism

differential diagnosis

edit

a lowered level of consciousness indicate a deficit in brain
function

4 level of consciousness can be lowered when the brain
receives insufficient oxygen as occurs in hypoxia insufficient blood
as occurs in shock in children for example due to intussusception or
has an alteration in the brain s chemistry

3 conditions of the
heart and conditions of the lungs can alter consciousness

 metabolic
disorders such as diabetes mellitus and uremia can alter
consciousness

12 hypo or hypernatremia decreased and elevated
levels of sodium respectively as well as dehydration can also produce
an altered loc

13 a ph outside of the range the brain can tolerate
will also alter loc

9 exposure to drugs e

g

 alcohol or toxins
may also lower loc3 as may a core temperature that is too high or
too low hyperthermia or hypothermia

 increases in intracranial
pressure the pressure within the skull can also cause altered loc

 it
can result from traumatic brain injury such as concussion

12
ischemic stroke and brain bleeding are other causes of altered
consciousness

12 infections of the central nervous system may also
be associated with decreased loc for example an altered loc is the
most common symptom of encephalitis

14 neoplasms within the
intracranial cavity can also affect consciousness12 as can
epilepsy and postseizure states

9 a decreased loc can also result
from a combination of factors

12 a concussion which is a mild
traumatic brain injury mtbi may result in decreased
loc

citation needed

treatment

edit

treatment depends on the degree of decrease in consciousness and its
underlying cause

 initial treatment often involves the administration of
dextrose if the blood sugar is low as well as the administration of
oxygen naloxone and thiamine
