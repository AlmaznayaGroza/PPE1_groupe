consciousness a psychological condition defined by the english
philosopher john locke as “the perception of what passes in a man s own
mind

”

”

early views

in the early 19th century the concept was variously considered

 some
philosophers regarded it as a kind of substance or “mental stuff”
quite different from the material substance of the physical world


others thought of it as an attribute characterized by sensation and
voluntary movement which separated animals and men from lower forms of
life and also described the difference between the normal waking state
of animals and men and their condition when asleep in a coma or under
anesthesia the latter condition was described as unconsciousness


other descriptions included an analysis of consciousness as a form of
relationship or act of the mind toward objects in nature and a view
that consciousness was a continuous field or stream of essentially
mental “sense data” roughly similar to the “ideas” of earlier empirical
philosophers

nervous system disease altered consciousness

the method employed by most early writers in observing consciousness was
introspection—looking within one s own mind to discover the laws of its
operation

 the limitations of the method became apparent when it was
found that because of differing preconceptions trained observers in the
laboratory often could not agree on fundamental observations



the behaviourist view

the failure of introspection to reveal consistent laws led to the
rejection of all mental states as proper subjects of scientific study


in behaviourist psychology derived primarily from work of the american
psychologist john b

 watson in the early 1900s the concept of
consciousness was irrelevant to the objective investigation of human
behaviour and was doctrinally ignored in research

 neobehaviourists
however adopted a more liberal posture toward mentalistic states such
as consciousness



neurophysiological mechanisms

that consciousness depends on the function of the brain has been known
from ancient times

 although detailed understanding of the neural
mechanisms of consciousness has not been achieved correlations between
states of consciousness and functions of the brain are possible

 levels
of consciousness in terms of levels of alertness or responsiveness are
correlated with patterns of electrical activity of the brain brain
waves recorded by an electroencephalograph

 during wideawake
consciousness the pattern of brain waves consists of rapid irregular
waves of low amplitude or voltage

 in contrast during sleep when
consciousness can be said to be minimal the brain waves are much slower
and of greater amplitude often coming in periodic bursts of slow waxing
and waning amplitude



both behavioral levels of consciousness and the correlated patterns of
electrical activity are related to the function of a part of the
brainstem called the reticular formation

 electrical stimulation of the
ascending reticular systems arouses a sleeping cat to alert
consciousness and simultaneously activates its brain waves to the waking
pattern

it was once supposed that the neurophysiological mechanisms subserving
consciousness and the higher mental processes must reside in the cortex


it is more likely however that the cortex serves the more specialized
functions of integrating patterns of sensory experience and organizing
motor patterns and that the ascending reticular system represents the
neural structures most critically related to consciousness

 the
brainstem reticular formation should not however be called the seat of
consciousness

 it represents an integrative focus functioning through
its widespread interconnections with the cortex and other regions of the
brain
