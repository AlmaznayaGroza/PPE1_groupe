everyone has a purpose few have a conscience

everyone has a purpose few have a conscience

purpose is the raison d être of a company the permanent basis of its
strategy

 every company has a purpose explicit or not however few –
although this is changing – have a conscience

 to be clear the mafia
has a purpose but consciousness is just another story



let s start with this litmus test “who said this statement

”

to start off relaxed i d like to invite you to play and take part in
this riddle with three possible answers although only one of them is
the right one



the question is who has explicitly told this institutional purpose



the purpose under scrutiny is

“caring for those around us always ensuring their wellbeing and that
of their families for a lifetime



protecting our environment taking care of raw materials giving
security to producers recycling our waste

”

the potential answers are

1

 paulus “paul” gerardus josephus maria polman former ceo of
 unilever
2

 pope francis 266th pope of the catholic church
3

 anthony “tony” john soprano sr

 capo di tutti capi – from the
 sopranos crime drama tv series





credit cowomen

before giving the right answer we must admit that all three could have
said that quote one talking about the unilever raison d être pope
francis in his second encyclical laudato si and we are left with tony
soprano whom you probably know i guess



and the correct choice is the number “3”

 words more or words least
this was the way tony soprano described to his psychologist the business
he was in and leading



by this what i mean is that everyone has a purpose even the mafia yet
few have a conscience and even fewer are specific in the way they define
it



consciousness needs sincerity rather than authenticity

for a company being true to itself means being concerned admitting
vulnerability and making bold choices

 for example stopping
collaborating with other firms that do not meet a company s standards of
conduct assuming responsibility for mistakes that affect society
abandoning businesses that are no longer legitimate

 in other words
being consistent between what the company thinks does and says



behaving truthfully and being unapologetically driven by values are two
of the essential characteristics that today s society is demanding from
each institution



see alsoa better future finale – advertisers total commitment to
people and communities

the key difference between being authentic and sincere is that a
business can be authentic and behave without a sense of morality or
ethics while it is impossible to think of a sincere company behaving in
that way



on the one hand we all have examples of rude unresponsive and abusive
companies that are authentic but are seldom true to themselves and
conscious of others

 on the other hand sincerity is about recognizing
that the company lives in a world that goes beyond its own borders

 it
is about deeply considering its impact on the planet being
selfconscious purposeful and going beyond the numbers to confirm and
express its true nature

 being sincere means knowing that there is a
pathway to live and work by its values down to every detail

 in this
way a company can become a genuine and inspiring brand





tony ryan ryan air credit criptomonedas yvon chouinard patagonia
credit  duna authenticity and sincerity capisci



another important issue to consider is that authenticity is an innate
behavior and sincerity is an acquired one



babies are authentic kids learn to behave sincerely

 the same can
happen with companies



business authenticity is a broader definition that considers the entire
spectrum of being true to itself while sincerity is more focused
brings wisdom care and a greater perspective than its own



people believe in honest brands

it is good business to be true to what the company is allowing the
public to recognize how it behaves with a conscience

 although in
addition society demands a positive social and environmental impact
from the company this does not mean that profit motives which are
necessary are hidden as a falsely sincere attitude



it is valid to recognize the need to “make money” whilst being
sympathetic to the audience in the way a company communicates

 that s
sincerity



brands trying to navigate this new world of conscience and sincerity
should act differently deeply believing in the way they think in the
values they defend doing the right thing and being honest about their
motivations



 “behaving truthfully and being unapologetically driven by values are
 two of the essential characteristics that today s society is demanding
 from each institution

”

if being honest and conscious brings on a deeper layer of seriousness
and respect being conscious of others helps take it to the next level
one that is increasingly demanded by all stakeholders including
citizens



“is your company radically honest

 ” i asked him


“of course it is

 we ve always been honest” he lied to me



conscientious purpose is an inherent part of business

from the beginning of time purpose is born with any enterprise
expressing its raison d être – even adam eve lilith and the apple



thus the purpose must be companyconnected and its fit is achieved
because the strategic aims are born from and aligned with such business



see alsohow brands can put purpose at the heart of their marketing
strategy

the challenge for the leadership team is to first understand the real
and deepest meaning of purpose translating it into an actionable
mission and vision

 it is a matter of alignment coherence and
consistency



these are the basis of a company s better performance not only in terms
of achieving better economic and financial results but also in
generating a positive impact



a conscientious purpose must be integrated into all aspects of how
companies do business



as life purpose is understood backwards but it must be lived forwards


this means that if purpose changes the company must change –
essentially because it must be reimagined redesigned and restarted to
live a new aspirational future

 this is a key point that is often
misunderstood



making a conscientious purpose explicit is a good first step

to be practical a good first step is to make the purpose explicit and
if it is already there to ensure that it really is the reason for the
company s existence and not a good narrative invented by the marketing
or communication areas



“holy graf zeppelin batman

” unfortunately we tend to produce such
conceptual monstrosities far too often

 deal with it

 if the purpose of
the business is only to make money that s what it is

 as mentioned
before it can change but it will imply that a new business was born



see alsogood enough isn t good enough

to reinforce deepen and above all be driven by a purpose in
addition to making it explicit companies must continuously translate it
into precise business objectives associated with it and in turn the
latter must be translated into visible actions and behaviors

 this
ensures executive responsiveness to the company s key audiences and
becomes the trigger for exceptional transformation and growth



the obvious steps sorry but i must insist on this to make purpose a
meaningful daytoday experience are

 think act and say – in that order
 measure the impact of how the company acts on purpose
 make the leadership team accountable
 ensure that all stakeholders understand and share that company s
 reason for existence
 build the company s symbols rituals and stories around it



brand and purpose brands with a conscience

branding aims at building a realistic meaning of the company in its
interaction with people independently but including the role they play
as citizens



in addition when the purpose includes the impact on society and the
environment the brand as a business platform helps prove the
consciousness of the company not to mention internal issues of
governance and responsible investments



when stakeholders understand live and share what the company stands
for and why that matters the results come on their own without out of
the ordinary efforts

 that s why i said at the very beginning of this
article that companies that act in line with their purpose create
value generate superior results and could even have a positive impact



see alsopodcast ep 7 why brands need longterm commitment to building
credibility with david aaker

if the company can t deliver on purpose its brand promise is basically
empty nonsense



three questions arise

 where are your company and your brand on this journey towards brands
 with a conscience


 is the company s purpose explicit and does it need to be
 transformed


 is the company ready for a transformation that will lead to growth
 into both results and impact
