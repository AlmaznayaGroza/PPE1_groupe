the freedom of conscience is fundamental to america s founding
principles and adf is committed to protecting that freedom

what is freedom of conscience and why does it matter



what is “conscience”

 it s a word we re all familiar with—a clear
conscience a guilty conscience—even if we can t pinpoint an exact
definition



the concept pops up in all kinds of places

 in saturday morning cartoons
where good guys consult an angel on their right shoulder conscience
and a devil on their left shoulder temptation before making a
decision

 in literary masterpieces like crime and punishment where the
main character suffers from overwhelming guilt after committing a crime


and in popular movies like star wars where darth vader chooses to do one
final good act after a lifetime of evil



but none of these examples capture the full concept of conscience

 as
americans we should consider the true meaning of “conscience

” we
should also recognize the importance—and privilege—of having the freedom
of conscience

 america was founded on this freedom

 and it s worth
preserving today



read on to find out why



what is freedom of conscience



conscience is our godgiven ability to discern right from wrong good
from evil

 but it s more than that

 for knowing right from wrong
wouldn t do much good if we didn t or couldn t act on what s right

 so
conscience also includes the ability to apply laws rules and
intuitions in the right way

 in other words to act on what we believe



a rural church is seen in a field

the first amendment protects our public witness

 we can put our faith in
action by serving others



where is freedom of conscience found in the constitution



america s founders understood the gravity of protecting the freedom of
conscience



james madison called conscience “the most sacred of all property

”
thomas jefferson said that no “provision in our constitution ought to be
dearer to man than that which protects the rights of conscience
against” the government

 and during the debate over what would become
the first amendment many lawmakers proposed protecting the rights of
conscience



this understanding shaped the first amendment

 although the amendment
doesn t explicitly mention “conscience” it protects its animating
features religious freedom and free speech

 the first amendment says
“congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of
speech or of the press

”

why is freedom of conscience important



these 26 words protect the freedom of conscience—the freedom to believe
without coercion and to speak and act consistently with those beliefs



that freedom begins internally the government cannot force us to act
contrary to our beliefs believe what we otherwise wouldn t or to say
things to which we object

 so we have the freedom to think reason
speak stay silent about and hold certain beliefs without fearing
government punishment

 that protects our private conscience



but our internal beliefs often move us to act publicly

 so the first
amendment also protects our public witness

 we can put our faith in
action by serving others

 we can try to persuade others of our views by
publicly expressing them

 and we can join communities of people—like
churches nonprofits and other associations—that share our beliefs



the first amendment also protects the freedom to act in several ways


religious freedom ensures a private sphere within which religious bodies
may govern themselves and instruct their congregants according to their
own beliefs

 that freedom preserves the integrity of those beliefs for
future generations



and the freedom of speech recognizes that voices are often louder when
expressed together

 so we can join with likeminded people to amplify
the messages and values we want to promote



it may be easy to take these freedoms for granted

 but not every country
has them

 consider france a country that generally discourages acts and
symbols of faith in the public sphere

 there for example muslim girls
cannot wear religious head coverings in school but other girls can wear
head scarfs for fashion

 in france that s laïcité

 in america that s
religious discrimination



the freedom to act on our beliefs is important because community
standards—or lack thereof—reflect individuals conscience

 the more we
train our conscience to do what is right the better off we will be

 but
we lose our ability to discern right from wrong the more we consistently
ignore our conscience



the freedom of conscience has also benefitted america s common good


because of this freedom religious organizations have founded and
currently operate countless hospitals homeless shelters adoption
agencies community centers and other public services

 pastors have
condemned social ills like racism and violence

 and religious people are
more likely to volunteer their time and contribute their money to all
sorts of charitable causes religious and secular alike



lorie smith of 303 creative is seen at work

adf represented graphic artist and website designer lorie smith at the
supreme court



what are some court cases dealing with freedom of conscience



the freedom of conscience is worth preserving

 several court cases seek
to do and have done just that

 consider three contexts

1

 the freedom of artists to speak according to their beliefs



2

 the freedom of medical providers to decline to provide medical
procedures that violate their conscience



3

 the freedom of faithbased publicservice ministries to operate in
line with their religious purpose



freedom of conscience for artists

for almost eighty years the u

s

 supreme court has recognized that
compelling someone to express a message they disagree with is
unconstitutional

 even so artists are still being threatened today for
declining to convey ideas that violate their beliefs



for example jack phillips of masterpiece cakeshop has been targeted
three times for declining to create custom cakes that promote ideas
about human sexuality that he doesn t believe

 jack s first case ended
in a major victory at the u

s

 supreme court

 more recently jack won
another victory when the colorado supreme court dismissed a lawsuit
brought against him



adf also represented graphic artist and website designer lorie smith at
the supreme court in 303 creative v

 elenis

 lorie runs 303 creative a
website design studio

 she creates beautiful original digital designs
to promote messages she s passionate about and wants to expand to
include custom websites that celebrate marriages between one man and one
woman



but lorie lives in colorado

 and colorado was trying to misuse one of
its laws to force her to create websites promoting messages that
contradict her beliefs about marriage

 unwilling to violate the law or
her conscience lorie challenged the law to protect the cherished
freedom to speak consistently with her religious views on marriage

 

in june 2023 the supreme court ruled that colorado could not use its
law to coerce lorie to express a message that violated her beliefs

 the
court said that the first amendment protects lorie s freedom to decide
which messages she wants to express and that includes the freedom to
design wedding websites consistent with her religious beliefs about
marriage



elsewhere across the country artists as diverse as florists and custom
print shops have been forced to choose between their faith and their
craft just as colorado tried to force lorie to do

 but fortunately the
first amendment makes that choice a false dichotomy



following the first amendment courts have protected the freedoms of
filmmakers calligraphers and a photographer to create artwork
proclaiming their views on marriage

 another court likewise ensured that
a christian philosophy professor could talk about gender identity
consistent with his belief about the immutability of sex

 lorie s
victory reaffirms that the supreme court still believes in the
importance of a free conscience

 that s how it should be

 every american
has the right to speak freely

 that s why lorie found support from a
diverse group of artists—from a worldrenowned graphic designer to a
christian tattoo artist a muslim wedding photographer and a cake
artist who hold different views about marriage



freedom of conscience for healthcare professionals

beyond speech the freedom of conscience is imperative in the medical
field

 since ancient times physicians have sworn to “do no harm” to
their patients

 fast forward to present day and professional medical
ethics acknowledge the rights of professionals to decline to provide
medical treatment that violates their conscience



the justification echoes the first amendment—to preserve the personal
integrity of the medical provider and the overall integrity of the
medical profession

 but not everyone sees it that way



in christian healthcare centers v

 nessel for example adf represents a
michigan faithbased medical nonprofit organization that provides
highquality health care to all and offers substantially reduced prices
for patients with lower incomes

 but a michigan law requires christian
healthcare to prescribe crosssex hormones to facilitate efforts to
alter a patient s biological sex

 doing so violates the ministry s
religious beliefs and undermines its ability to provide safe health care
to its community

 so the ministry challenged the law to safeguard its
freedom to operate consistent with its beliefs



likewise in state of texas and mayo pharmacy v

 hhs adf represents
mayo pharmacy a pharmacy in north dakota that practices consistent with
its catholic faith

 the pharmacy is challenging a regulation that
requires it to dispense drugs prescribed to induce abortions against its
religious convictions

 in july 2023 a federal district court ruled that
the case must proceed



freedom of conscience for faithbased ministries

the freedom of conscience allows faithbased ministries to provide other
public services to care for the most vulnerable among us

 for example
adf has twice defended downtown hope center a christian nonprofit
organization in anchorage alaska

 the hope center offers meals job
training and clothing for homeless men and women and serves as an
overnight shelter for women—many of whom are trying to escape from
abusive situations and even from sex trafficking



and adf represented new hope family services in new york

 for almost
sixty years new hope has helped to place more than 1000 children into
loving adoptive homes throughout the state

 it does so because of its
religious conviction that christians are called to look after the
needy—especially children

 a court recently protected new hope s ability
to continue to care for these children and their families according to
its religious beliefs



these ministries provide critical services to their communities

 and
they do so because of their religious beliefs

 this is a common feature
of american history made possible by the freedom of conscience

 in that
way protecting the ability of these ministries to live out their faith
ensures that other religious organizations can do the same while
contributing to the common good



conclusion

by now we ve answered the original question—what is conscience

 and
we ve answered another— why is freedom of conscience worth preserving



in the end this freedom recognizes the inherent dignity of each person
as created in god s image and endowed with the godgiven capacity to
make moral judgments

 we all benefit from that freedom
