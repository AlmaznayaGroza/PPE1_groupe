The
New
Grown-Up


There’s
been
a
fundamental
shift
in
how
we
define
adulthood—and
at

what
pace
it
occurs
.


PT’s
authors
consider
how
a
once
iron-clad

construct
is
now
up
for
grabs—and
what
it
means
for
young
people’s

mental
health
today

This
post
is
Part
I
of
a
series
.



The
field
of
consciousness
studies
has
come
of
age
.


Prior
to
the
1990s
,
theories
of
consciousness
were
more
of
a
philosophical
pursuit
than
a
serious
scientific
one
.


This
was
largely
because
scientists
considered
the
domain
of
subjective
experience—which
is
what
consciousness
fundamentally
is—to
be
,
well
,
too
subjective
.


It
just
didn’t
seem
amenable
to
objective
empirical
study
using
the
scientific
method
.


And
the
whole
concept
of
consciousness
was
considered
too
slippery
and
vague
.



Quicksand
?



Even
now
,
in
my
own
very
practically-oriented
clinical
field
of
psychiatry—one
which
relies
heavily
on
subjective
self-report
by
patients—when
I
talk
with
colleagues
about
my
interest
in
the
science
of
consciousness
and
tell
them
about
the
scientific
conferences
focused
on
it
,
which
I
like
to
attend
,
I
am
met
with
comments
such
as
this
one
from
a
recent
email
exchange
:
“You
brave
,
brave
man
,
you—willing
to
wade
into
the
bottomless
pit
of
quicksand
that
is
consciousness
studies…
I
run
,
screaming
,
in
the
opposite
direction
.

”

My
response
to
this
quip
was
to
point
out
that
a
quick
glance
at
the
program
of
the
particular
conference
I
had
just
returned
from
would
attest
to
the
fact
that
this
field
has
matured
into
a
rigorous
and
rapidly
developing
sphere
of
neuroscience
,
with
considerably
less
quicksand
than
before
.


An
additional
criticism
could
legitimately
be
that
the
topic
of
consciousness
has
attracted
a
huge
number
of
mystical
woo
practitioners
,
but
even
if
99
percent
of
the
field
were
comprised
of
pseudoscience
,
this
conference
and
the
large
,
vibrant
scientific
community
it
represents
would
certainly
be
the
other
1
percent
.



The
hard
problem

Inevitably
,
attempts
to
scientifically
explain
consciousness
run
up
against
the
“explanatory
gap”
or
what
is
called
the
“hard
problem”
of
consciousness—the
problem
of
subjective
experience
:
Why
it
feels
like
something
to
be
conscious
.

¹
Or
,
as
the
philosopher
Thomas
Nagel
famously
formulated
it
:
“something
that
it
is
like
to
be
.

”²
The
so-called
“easy
problems”
concern
questions
like
how
the
brain
processes
information
,
how
different
sensory
inputs
are
integrated
,
how
memories
are
formed
,
and
how
we
can
selectively
focus
our
attention
.


They
are
“easy”
relative
to
the
hard
problem
in
that
they
are
more
scientifically
tractable
.



Correlates
vs
.


explanations

In
the
early
decades
of
the
revival
of
scientific
interest
in
studying
consciousness
,
research
focused
on
identifying
the
“neural
correlates
of
consciousness”
(NCCs)
,
which
are
the
essential
neural
events
needed
to
produce
conscious
states
.


That
search
concentrated
on
brain
states
closely
tied
to
consciousness
.


Over
time
,
more
attention
has
been
directed
toward
developing
theories
of
consciousness
(ToCs)
.


While
the
NCC
approach
looks
for
correlations
between
brain
activity
and
consciousness
,
ToCs
seek
explanatory
links
between
neural
mechanisms
and
aspects
of
consciousness
.



A
proliferation
of
theories

Presently
we
are
still
at
a
relatively
early
stage
in
the
scientific
study
of
consciousness
.


At
this
point
,
there
are
a
great
many
theories
of
consciousness
proliferating
and
competing
with
each
other
.


Those
theories
sometimes
seem
to
talk
past
each
other
as
they
explore
vastly
different
approaches
to
the
problem
.


Attempting
to
understand
the
various
ToCs
and
how
they
contrast
with
one
another
can
be
quite
overwhelming
,
even
for
those
with
a
good
deal
of
familiarity
with
the
field
.



In
recent
years
,
there
have
been
a
number
of
academic
papers
attempting
to
catalogue
and
compare
the
various
theories
.

³
Still
,
for
the
general
reader
,
it
can
all
be
quite
confusing
and
impenetrable
.


This
five-part
blog
series
will
attempt
to
make
some
of
the
major
theories
more
accessible
to
a
general
,
educated
readership
.


Only
a
few
major
theories
will
be
covered
here
.


Several
others
have
already
been
previously
covered
in
my
other
blog
posts
.

Four
leading
contenders

Among
the
most
helpful
recent
academic
journal
articles
comparing
different
theories
of
consciousness
is
a
2022
paper
by
Anil
Seth
and
Tim
Bayne
.

⁵

Seth
and
Bayne
focus
their
review
mainly
on
the
following
four
prominent
theoretical
approaches
to
consciousness
.


I
will
briefly
summarize
these
here
in
simple
terms
:

1
.


Higher-order
theories
(HOTs)
:
These
theories
propose
that
thoughts

become
conscious
when
basic
perceptions
(“lower-order”

representations)
become
re-represented
as
higher-order

representations
at
higher
levels
of
the
brain
,
specifically
in
the

prefrontal
cortex
.


2
.


Global
workspace
theories
(GWTs)
:
According
to
these
theories
,

perceptions
,
thoughts
,
emotions
,
etc
.


become
conscious
when
they

gain
access
to
a
“workspace
,”
or
to
apply
another
analogy
,
when
they

make
it
into
the
“spotlight”—as
if
the
mind
were
a
theater
where

conscious
thought
is
the
activity
in
the
spotlight
on
the
stage
at
a

given
moment
(except
that
,
unlike
in
the
analogy
,
the
actual

workspace
in
the
brain
is
not
localized
but
rather
is
distributed

across
the
frontal
and
parietal
regions
of
the
cortex
,
according
to

the
theory)
.


3
.


Integrated
information
theory
(IIT)
:
This
theory
is
about
how
parts

of
a
brain
interact
to
create
a
unified
experience
.


Consciousness
is

theorized
to
be
related
to
how
much
information
is
integrated
among

the
different
parts
of
the
brain
.


IIT
tries
to
mathematically

measure
this
.


The
more
information
that
is
connected
and
integrated
,

the
more
conscious
the
system
is
thought
to
be
.


The
theory
suggests

that
not
just
brains
but
any
complex
system
with
the
right
level
of

interconnectedness
and
integration
of
information
could
exhibit

consciousness
,
with
simpler
systems
manifesting
only
an

insignificant
modicum
of
consciousness
.


IIT
attempts
to
explain
the

quality
of
conscious
experience
,
suggesting
that
the
unique
pattern

of
relationships
between
the
elements
of
the
system
is
what
defines

a
particular
conscious
experience
.


4
.


Re-entry
and
predictive
processing
theories
:
The
core
claim
of

re-entry
theory
and
predictive
processing
is
that
conscious
mental

states
are
associated
with
top-down
signaling
.


Top-down
signaling

refers
to
the
process
by
which
higher-level
brain
regions
send

information
,
expectations
,
or
context
to
lower-level
brain
regions
.



This
communication
helps
shape
how
the
brain
perceives
and

interprets
bottom-up
information
received
via
its
sense
organs
from

the
world
around
it
.


(Predictive
processing
theories
are
not

specifically
theories
of
consciousness
but
are
more
general
accounts

of
brain
function
that
can
be
used
to
formulate
ideas
about
the

properties
of
consciousness
.

Other
strong
contenders

Besides
the
above
four
categories
of
theories
,
Seth
and
Bayne
also
acknowledge
other
well-developed
approaches
to
consciousness—ones
that
involve
attention
,
learning
,
and
affect
:

Theoretical
approaches
focused
on
attention
:

-
Attention
schema
theory
(AST)
:
This
is
discussed
in
my
post
“Is

Consciousness
an
Illusion
?

”

Theoretical
approaches
focused
on
learning
:

-
Unlimited
associative
learning
(UAL)
:
This
is
discussed
in
my
post

“Learning
May
Be
the
Key
to
the
Evolution
of
Consciousness
.

”
UAL

arguably
has
the
strongest
evolutionary
grounding
of
all
the

theories
.

⁶
-
Other
learning-based
theories
overlap
with
some
theories
described

under
the
four
main
sets
of
theories
listed
above
,
such
as
Axel

Cleeremans’
version
of
higher-order
theory
(HOT)
and
Victor
Lamme’s

local
recurrency
account
.

⁷
-
Learning-based
theories
are
also
closely
related
to
“selectionist”

approaches
,
which
ground
consciousness
in
evolutionary-like
dynamics

within
and
between
neuronal
populations
(referring
to
Gerald

Edelman’s
Neural
Darwinism
theory)
.

⁸

Affect-based
theories
:

-
Damasio’s
“self
comes
to
mind”
theory
:
According
to
this
theory
,

consciousness
depends
on
interactions
between
homeostatic
routines

and
multilevel
interoceptive
maps
,
with
affect
and
feeling
at
the

core
.

⁹
This
is
discussed
in
my
posts
“Are
We
All
Zombies
?

”
and
“The

Brain
as
a
Prediction
Machine
:
The
Key
to
the
Self
?

”
-
Some
proposals
mix
an
affect-based
emphasis
with
predictive

processing
to
ground
conscious
experiences
in
control-oriented

interoceptive
predictions
.


This
refers
to
the
way
the
brain
controls

the
body’s
internal
organs
and
physiological
parameters
by
making

predictions
about
what
they
should
be
.


For
example
,
the
brain

predicts
what
the
body’s
blood
glucose
level
should
be
and
then

sends
signals
to
adjust
that
state
if
it
deviates
from
predictions

(Anil
Seth’s
“beast
machine”
theory—discussed
in
my
posts
“The
Brain

as
a
Prediction
Machine
:
The
Key
to
Consciousness
?

”
and
“The
Key
to

the
Self
?

”
and
Lisa
Feldman
Barrett’s
theory¹⁰)
.


-
Some
affect-based
theories
consider
cortical
mechanisms
to
be

unnecessary
for
consciousness
,
suggesting
instead
that
the

mechanisms
of
consciousness
are
located
in
the
brainstem
(e
.

g
.


,
the

theories
of
Mark
Solms¹¹
and
Bjorn
Merker¹²)

In
future
parts
of
this
blog
series
,
we
will
discuss
HOTs
,
GWTs
,
IIT
,
re-entry
and
predictive
processing
theories
,
following
which
we
will
be
in
a
better
position
to
judge
whether
the
field
is
any
closer
to
solving
the
“hard
problem”
of
consciousness
,
or
whether
there
really
is
such
a
problem
at
all
.

The
subjective
quality
of
a
conscious
experience
is
also
referred
to
as
“qualia”
–
for
example
the
redness
of
red
.


Is
the
experience
of
seeing
redness
the
same
for
you
as
for
me
?


We
assume
it
is
,
but
there’s
no
really
objective
way
to
tell
.


And
why
and
how
should
the
visual
experience
even
have
this
“redness”
quality
at
all
,
as
the
product
of
electrical
and
chemical
signals
reverberating
in
our
physical
brains
?


The
answers
to
these
questions
are
not
self-evident

Another
theory
of
consciousness
with
a
strong
evolutionary
grounding
is
Feinberg
and
Mallatt
'
s
theory
,
which
was
previously
reviewed
by
me
but
was
not
mentioned
in
Seth
&
Bayne
'
s
article
.


Feinberg
and
Mallatt
'
s
theory
is
broadly
in
agreement
with
UAL
.

According
to
this
theory
,
consciousness
depends
on
re-entrant
interactions
reflecting
a
history
of
value-dependent
learning
events
shaped
by
selectionist
principles
.

The
term
interoceptive
refers
to
perception
of
sensory
signals
that
originate
from
within
the
body
,
especially
in
the
gut
and
other
internal
organs
,
as
opposed
to
exteroceptive
,
which
refers
to
stimuli
from
the
external
environment
.

Solms
'

theory
is
congruent
with
the
important
work
on
affective
neuroscience
done
by
Jaak
Panksepp
and
is
also
congruent
with
the
Free

Principle
by
the
influential
neuroscientist
Karl
Friston
,
both
of
whom
Solms
collaborated
with
.

The
New
Grown-Up

There’s
been
a
fundamental
shift
in
how
we
define
adulthood—and
at
what
pace
it
occurs
.


PT’s
authors
consider
how
a
once
iron-clad
construct
is
now
up
for
grabs—and
what
it
means
for
young
people’s
mental
health
today
.
