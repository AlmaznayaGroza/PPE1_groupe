key points

 leading theories of consciousness include hot gwt iit reentry
 and predictive processing theories


 other welldeveloped theoretical approaches to consciousness involve
 attention learning and affect


 many theories seek to solve the “hard problem” of consciousness but
 not everyone agrees the problem exists

this post is part i of a series



the field of consciousness studies has come of age

 prior to the 1990s
theories of consciousness were more of a philosophical pursuit than a
serious scientific one

 this was largely because scientists considered
the domain of subjective experience—which is what consciousness
fundamentally is—to be well too subjective

 it just didn t seem
amenable to objective empirical study using the scientific method

 and
the whole concept of consciousness was considered too slippery and
vague



quicksand



even now in my own very practicallyoriented clinical field of
psychiatry—one which relies heavily on subjective selfreport by
patients—when i talk with colleagues about my interest in the science of
consciousness and tell them about the scientific conferences focused on
it which i like to attend i am met with comments such as this one from
a recent email exchange “you brave brave man you—willing to wade into
the bottomless pit of quicksand that is consciousness studies i run
screaming in the opposite direction

”

my response to this quip was to point out that a quick glance at the
program of the particular conference i had just returned from would
attest to the fact that this field has matured into a rigorous and
rapidly developing sphere of neuroscience with considerably less
quicksand than before

 an additional criticism could legitimately be
that the topic of consciousness has attracted a huge number of mystical
woo practitioners but even if 99 percent of the field were comprised of
pseudoscience this conference and the large vibrant scientific
community it represents would certainly be the other 1 percent



the hard problem

inevitably attempts to scientifically explain consciousness run up
against the “explanatory gap” or what is called the “hard problem” of
consciousness—the problem of subjective experience why it feels like
something to be conscious

¹ or as the philosopher thomas nagel famously
formulated it “something that it is like to be

”² the socalled “easy
problems” concern questions like how the brain processes information
how different sensory inputs are integrated how memories are formed
and how we can selectively focus our attention

 they are “easy” relative
to the hard problem in that they are more scientifically tractable



correlates vs

 explanations

in the early decades of the revival of scientific interest in studying
consciousness research focused on identifying the “neural correlates of
consciousness” nccs which are the essential neural events needed to
produce conscious states

 that search concentrated on brain states
closely tied to consciousness

 over time more attention has been
directed toward developing theories of consciousness tocs

 while the
ncc approach looks for correlations between brain activity and
consciousness tocs seek explanatory links between neural mechanisms and
aspects of consciousness



a proliferation of theories

presently we are still at a relatively early stage in the scientific
study of consciousness

 at this point there are a great many theories
of consciousness proliferating and competing with each other

 those
theories sometimes seem to talk past each other as they explore vastly
different approaches to the problem

 attempting to understand the
various tocs and how they contrast with one another can be quite
overwhelming even for those with a good deal of familiarity with the
field



in recent years there have been a number of academic papers attempting
to catalogue and compare the various theories

³ still for the general
reader it can all be quite confusing and impenetrable

 this fivepart
blog series will attempt to make some of the major theories more
accessible to a general educated readership

 only a few major theories
will be covered here

 several others have already been previously
covered in my other blog posts

⁴

four leading contenders

among the most helpful recent academic journal articles comparing
different theories of consciousness is a 2022 paper by anil seth and tim
bayne

⁵

seth and bayne focus their review mainly on the following four prominent
theoretical approaches to consciousness

 i will briefly summarize these
here in simple terms

1

 higherorder theories hots these theories propose that thoughts
 become conscious when basic perceptions “lowerorder”
 representations become rerepresented as higherorder
 representations at higher levels of the brain specifically in the
 prefrontal cortex


2

 global workspace theories gwts according to these theories
 perceptions thoughts emotions etc

 become conscious when they
 gain access to a “workspace” or to apply another analogy when they
 make it into the “spotlight”—as if the mind were a theater where
 conscious thought is the activity in the spotlight on the stage at a
 given moment except that unlike in the analogy the actual
 workspace in the brain is not localized but rather is distributed
 across the frontal and parietal regions of the cortex according to
 the theory


3

 integrated information theory iit this theory is about how parts
 of a brain interact to create a unified experience

 consciousness is
 theorized to be related to how much information is integrated among
 the different parts of the brain

 iit tries to mathematically
 measure this

 the more information that is connected and integrated
 the more conscious the system is thought to be

 the theory suggests
 that not just brains but any complex system with the right level of
 interconnectedness and integration of information could exhibit
 consciousness with simpler systems manifesting only an
 insignificant modicum of consciousness

 iit attempts to explain the
 quality of conscious experience suggesting that the unique pattern
 of relationships between the elements of the system is what defines
 a particular conscious experience


4

 reentry and predictive processing theories the core claim of
 reentry theory and predictive processing is that conscious mental
 states are associated with topdown signaling

 topdown signaling
 refers to the process by which higherlevel brain regions send
 information expectations or context to lowerlevel brain regions


 this communication helps shape how the brain perceives and
 interprets bottomup information received via its sense organs from
 the world around it

 predictive processing theories are not
 specifically theories of consciousness but are more general accounts
 of brain function that can be used to formulate ideas about the
 properties of consciousness

what happened to the stratification view of nature



other strong contenders

besides the above four categories of theories seth and bayne also
acknowledge other welldeveloped approaches to consciousness—ones that
involve attention learning and affect

theoretical approaches focused on attention

 attention schema theory ast this is discussed in my post “is
 consciousness an illusion

”

theoretical approaches focused on learning

 unlimited associative learning ual this is discussed in my post
 “learning may be the key to the evolution of consciousness

” ual
 arguably has the strongest evolutionary grounding of all the
 theories

⁶
 other learningbased theories overlap with some theories described
 under the four main sets of theories listed above such as axel
 cleeremans version of higherorder theory hot and victor lamme s
 local recurrency account

⁷
 learningbased theories are also closely related to “selectionist”
 approaches which ground consciousness in evolutionarylike dynamics
 within and between neuronal populations referring to gerald
 edelman s neural darwinism theory

⁸

affectbased theories

 damasio s “self comes to mind” theory according to this theory
 consciousness depends on interactions between homeostatic routines
 and multilevel interoceptive maps with affect and feeling at the
 core

⁹ this is discussed in my posts “are we all zombies

” and “the
 brain as a prediction machine the key to the self

”
 some proposals mix an affectbased emphasis with predictive
 processing to ground conscious experiences in controloriented
 interoceptive predictions

 this refers to the way the brain controls
 the body s internal organs and physiological parameters by making
 predictions about what they should be

 for example the brain
 predicts what the body s blood glucose level should be and then
 sends signals to adjust that state if it deviates from predictions
 anil seth s “beast machine” theory—discussed in my posts “the brain
 as a prediction machine the key to consciousness

” and “the key to
 the self

” and lisa feldman barrett s theory¹⁰


 some affectbased theories consider cortical mechanisms to be
 unnecessary for consciousness suggesting instead that the
 mechanisms of consciousness are located in the brainstem e

g

 the
 theories of mark solms¹¹ and bjorn merker¹²

in future parts of this blog series we will discuss hots gwts iit
reentry and predictive processing theories following which we will be
in a better position to judge whether the field is any closer to solving
the “hard problem” of consciousness or whether there really is such a
problem at all

1

 the subjective quality of a conscious experience is also referred to
as “qualia” – for example the redness of red

 is the experience of
seeing redness the same for you as for me

 we assume it is but there s
no really objective way to tell

 and why and how should the visual
experience even have this “redness” quality at all as the product of
electrical and chemical signals reverberating in our physical brains


the answers to these questions are not selfevident

 according to this theory consciousness depends on reentrant
interactions reflecting a history of valuedependent learning events
shaped by selectionist principles
