Editorial

Consciousness

by
Rick
Lewis

It
gives
me
particular
pleasure
to
introduce
an
issue
focussing
on
consciousness
,
as
I
myself
am
sometimes
conscious
.


I
know
the
same
goes
for
many
of
you
.


But
there
is
a
great
deal
of
debate
among
philosophers
about
what
this
actually
means
.



The
nature
of
consciousness
is
a
philosophical
problem
which
has
come
to
centre
stage
mainly
in
the
last
few
years
.


As
the
neuroscientists
have
gradually
found
out
more
and
more
about
the
workings
of
the
brain
,
philosophers
have
wondered
whether
any
part
of
the
mind
is
inaccessible
to
scientific
investigation
.


Many
have
argued
that
even
if
we
find
out
everything
about
the
way
the
brain
physically
functions
,
there
will
still
be
something
vital
missing
from
our
picture
.


What
this
is
,
of
course
,
is
an
understanding
of
how
our
subjective
experiences
come
about
.


This
is
what
David
Chalmers
calls
the
‘hard
problem’
of
consciousness
.



In
this
issue
we
have
articles
looking
at
this
problem
from
a
wide
variety
of
viewpoints
.


In
the
first
of
them
,
Mary
Midgley
says
that
many
people
talk
about
consciousness
as
if
the
brain
was
in
isolation
.


She
says
we
need
to
step
back
and
see
consciousness
in
its
wider
context
,
which
is
the
context
of
organic
life
.



If
conscious
life
had
to
be
organic
,
this
would
rule
out
the
possibility
of
conscious
machines
.


Professor
Igor
Aleksander
,
(see
interview
)
is
an
expert
on
artificial
intelligence
.


He
,
at
least
,
thinks
that
it
is
possible
to
build
robots
which
are
conscious
of
their
surroundings
in
a
sense
broadly
similar
to
the
sense
in
which
we
say
that
humans
are
aware
of
their
surroundings
.


He
aims
to
prove
this
by
actually
building
one
,
and
has
already
made
some
progress
in
that
direction
.



There
is
a
huge
contrast
between
Igor
Aleksander’s
view
and
that
of
the
French
philosopher
Henri
Bergson
(1859-1941
)
.


Bergson
was
a
towering
figure
in
French
philosophy
in
the
early
20th
century
–
the
Jacques
Derrida
of
his
day
.


However
,
he
has
gone
into
a
profound
eclipse
.


Reading
John-Francis
Phipps’
article
about
him
,
it
isn’t
hard
to
see
why
–
there
can
be
few
philosophers
less
in
tune
with
the
intellectual
spirit
of
the
early
21st
century
than
our
Henri
.


Still
,
for
that
very
reason
his
ideas
on
consciousness
give
a
completely
different
perspective
on
the
subject
from
that
to
which
we’re
now
accustomed
.



Some
people
approach
the
problem
by
pointing
out
that
consciousness
is
always
consciousness
of
something
.


I
was
conscious
of
the
gathering
clouds
.


You
were
conscious
of
the
rain
falling
on
your
face
.


So
,
they
say
,
consciousness
is
always
directed
towards
something
.


It
has
‘aboutness’
or
in
philo-jargon
,
intentionality
.


This
isn’t
the
only
way
we
talk
about
consciousness
in
everyday
speech
,
however
.


As
Jeanne
Warren
points
out
in
her
article
on
John
Macmurray
,
we
also
use
it
to
mean
the
opposite
of
unconsciousness
–
of
being
asleep
,
or
in
a
coma
.


There
isn’t
necessarily
any
huge
divergence
of
meaning
here
,
as
when
we
say
“Has
Fred
regained
consciousness
?

”
we
might
be
asking
whether
he
has
become
aware
again
of
all
the
various
things
and
people
around
him
.



Though
the
theme
of
this
issue
is
consciousness
,
a
second
,
unanticipated
theme
seems
to
have
crept
in
as
well
.


With
articles
on
Henri
Bergson
,
John
Macmurray
and
John
Herschel
,
we
have
pieces
on
three
thinkers
who
are
regarded
by
some
as
being
unjustly
neglected
.


Bergson
and
Herschel
were
acclaimed
as
giants
in
their
own
day
.


Macmurray
wasn’t
,
but
has
gradually
gathered
admirers
in
the
years
since
his
demise
.



From
one
of
the
most
conceptually
difficult
problems
of
philosophy
,
we
turn
to
one
of
the
most
practically
worrying
ethical
issue
of
today
.


The
headlines
have
been
filled
recently
by
the
misdeeds
of
soldiers
stationed
in
Iraq
–
the
torture
of
prisoners
,
the
deaths
of
civilians
.


In
the
first
article
in
this
issue
,
philosophy
graduate
Douglas
Gearhart
,
who
served
as
a
PSYOPS
(psychological
operations
)
specialist
in
Iraq
,
appeals
to
philosophers
to
develop
practical
moral
guidance
and
moral
training
for
soldiers
in
battlefield
situations
.


Scholastic
philosophers
like
Thomas
Aquinas
,
called
this
aspect
of
just
war
theory
jus
in
bello
.


If
Gearhart
is
right
,
it
should
cease
being
seen
as
a
quaint
relic
of
medieval
thought
and
instead
become
the
urgent
concern
of
ethicists
everywhere
.


In
a
way
this
is
also
about
consciousness
,
as
the
choices
soldiers
make
in
wars
are
conscious
choices
,
but
ones
made
under
enormous
stress
and
without
the
steadying
framework
of
everyday
civilian
life
.


How
can
they
recall
more
easily
in
such
situations
a
conscious
awareness
of
the
dignity
and
fragility
of
human
life
?
