Equity
and
good
conscience means
fairness
as
applied
to
a
given
set
of
circumstances
.


(2
)
It
will
be
against
equity
and
good
conscience
to
deny
waiver
when
repayment
of
the
overpayment
would
deprive
you
of
income
required
to
provide
for
basic
necessities
including
food
,
shelter
,
medicine
,
utilities
,
and
related
expenses
.


Unless
there
are
unusual
circumstances
which
would
argue
against
waiver
,
the
department
will
presume
repayment
would
leave
you
unable
to
provide
basic
necessities
if
your
total
household
resources
in
relation
to
household
size
do
not
exceed
seventy
percent
of
the
Lower
Living
Standard
Income
Level
(LLSIL
)
and
circumstances
are
not
expected
to
change
within
the
next
ninety
days
.


(3
)
The
department
may
also
consider
,
but
is
not
limited
to
,
the
following
factors
in
determining
whether
waiver
should
be
granted
for
reasons
of
equity
and
good
conscience
:
(a
)
Your
general
health
,
including
disability
,
competency
,
and
mental
or
physical
impairment
;
(b
)
Your
education
level
,
including
literacy
;
(c
)
Whether
you
are
currently
employed
and
your
history
of
unemployment
;
(d
)
Your
future
earnings
potential
based
on
your
occupation
,
skills
,
and
the
local
labor
market
;

(e
)
Your
marital
status
and
number
of
dependents
,
including
whether
other
household
members
are
employed
;
(f
)
Whether
an
error
by
department
staff
contributed
to
the
overpayment
;
(g
)
Whether
you
refused
or
were
ineligible
for
other
government
benefits
because
you
received
unemployment
benefits
;
and
(h
)
Other
factors
indicating
that
repayment
of
the
full
amount
would
cause
you
undue
economic
,
physical
,
or
mental
hardship
.


(4
)
When
determining
whether
a
waiver
of
benefit
overpayments
may
be
granted
based
on
equity
and
good
conscience
,
the
department
must
consider
whether
the
employer
or
employer
'
s
agent
failed
to
respond
timely
or
adequately
without
good
cause
to
the
department
'
s
written
request
for
claim
information
.


This
subsection
does
not
apply
to
negotiated
settlements
.


(5
)
The
decision
to
grant
or
deny
waiver
will
be
based
on
the
totality
of
circumstances
rather
than
the
presence
of
a
single
factor
listed
in
subsections
(2
)
,
(3
)
,
and

)
