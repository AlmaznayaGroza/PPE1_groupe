equity and good conscience means fairness as applied to a given set of
circumstances

 2 it will be against equity and good conscience to deny
waiver when repayment of the overpayment would deprive you of income
required to provide for basic necessities including food shelter
medicine utilities and related expenses

 unless there are unusual
circumstances which would argue against waiver the department will
presume repayment would leave you unable to provide basic necessities if
your total household resources in relation to household size do not
exceed seventy percent of the lower living standard income level llsil
and circumstances are not expected to change within the next ninety
days

 3 the department may also consider but is not limited to the
following factors in determining whether waiver should be granted for
reasons of equity and good conscience a your general health
including disability competency and mental or physical impairment b
your education level including literacy c whether you are currently
employed and your history of unemployment d your future earnings
potential based on your occupation skills and the local labor market
e your marital status and number of dependents including whether
other household members are employed f whether an error by department
staff contributed to the overpayment g whether you refused or were
ineligible for other government benefits because you received
unemployment benefits and h other factors indicating that repayment
of the full amount would cause you undue economic physical or mental
hardship

 4 when determining whether a waiver of benefit overpayments
may be granted based on equity and good conscience the department must
consider whether the employer or employer s agent failed to respond
timely or adequately without good cause to the department s written
request for claim information

 this subsection does not apply to
negotiated settlements

 5 the decision to grant or deny waiver will be
based on the totality of circumstances rather than the presence of a
single factor listed in subsections 2 3 and 4
