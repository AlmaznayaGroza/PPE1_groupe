From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

This article is about the conscience clause in medicine. For the
conscience clause in the 19th century English educational system, see
Conscience clause (education).

Conscience clauses are legal clauses attached to laws in some parts of
the United States and other countries which permit pharmacists,
physicians, and/or other providers of health care not to provide certain
medical services for reasons of religion or conscience. It can also
involve parents withholding consenting for particular treatments for
their children.^([1])

In many cases, the clauses also permit health care providers to refuse
to refer patients to unopposed providers. Those who choose not to refer
or provide services may not be disciplined or discriminated against. The
provision is most frequently enacted in connection with issues relating
to reproduction, such as abortion (see conscientious objection to
abortion), sterilization, contraception, and stem cell based treatments,
but may include any phase of patient care.^([2])

History

[edit]

[]

Inside drawer to Senator Frank Church's (D-ID) senate desk

The earliest national conscience clause law in the United States, which
was enacted immediately following the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v.
Wade, applied only to abortion and sterilization. It was sponsored by
Senator Frank Church of Idaho.^([3]) The Church Amendment of 1973,
passed by the Senate on a vote of 92–1, exempted private hospitals
receiving federal funds under the Hill-Burton Act, Medicare and Medicaid
from any requirement to provide abortions or sterilizations when they
objected on “the basis of religious beliefs or moral convictions.”
Nearly every state enacted similar legislation by the end of the
decade—often with the support of legislators who otherwise supported
abortion rights. Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, the author of the
Roe v. Wade majority opinion, endorsed such clauses “appropriate
protection” for individual physicians and denominational
hospitals.^([4])

According to Nancy Berlinger, of the bioethics research institute The
Hastings Center, "...Conscientious objection in health care always has a
social dimension and ...Laws and professional guidelines on
conscientious objection in health care must balance the respect for an
individual’s beliefs against the well-being of the general
public."^([1])

Conscience clauses have been adopted by a number of U.S. states.
including Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi,
Pennsylvania, and South Dakota. There are some recent comprehensive
reviews of federal and state conscience clause laws across the United
States and in select other countries.^([5])

Some clauses address local concerns: Oregon, recognizes a physician's
right to refuse to participate in physician-assisted suicide, although
it is legal in that state.^([1])

Informed consent

[edit]

An informed consent clause, although allowing medical professionals not
to perform procedures against their conscience, does not allow
professionals to give fraudulent information to deter a patient from
obtaining such a procedure (such as lying about the risks involved in an
abortion to deter one from obtaining one) in order to impose one's
belief using deception. These principles were reaffirmed in the Utah
Supreme Court's decision in Wood v. University of Utah Medical Center
(2002).^([6]) Commenting on the case, bioethicist Jacob Appel of New
York University wrote that "if only a small number of physicians
intentionally or negligently withhold information from their patients
significant damage is done to the medical profession as a whole" because
"pregnant women will no longer know whether to trust their
doctors."^([7])

Right of Conscience Rule

[edit]

The Right of Conscience Rule was a set of protections for healthcare
workers enacted by President George W. Bush on December 18, 2008,
allowing healthcare workers to refuse care based on their personal
beliefs.^([8]) Specifically, the rule denied federal funding to
institutions that did not allow workers to refuse care that went against
their beliefs. In February 2011, President Barack Obama rescinded the
Right of Conscience Rule.^([9][10])

Pharmacists

[edit]

States have historically provided a conscience clause right allowing
pharmacists to refrain from participating in abortions.^([11]) In April
2005, Governor Rod Blagojevich by emergency executive order required all
pharmacists to provide Plan B levonorgestrel. In September 2012, the
Illinois Appellate Court found the Governor's order violated Illinois
law.^([12])

In June 2006, the Pharmacy Board of the Washington State Department of
Health rejected a draft rule proposed by Governor Christine Gregoire to
require all pharmacies to begin carrying Plan B.^([13]) Governor
Gregoire responded by releasing a public statement warning the board
members to reconsider or they could be removed.^([13]) In July 2006, the
Washington State Human Rights Commission warned the board members that
they would be personally liable for illegally discriminating against
women if they did not pass the Governor's Plan B rule.^([13][14]) In
April 2007, the Board approved a final rule prohibiting pharmacies from
not stocking Plan B for religious reasons but allowing exemptions for
“good faith” business reasons.^([13])

When Ralph's Thriftway, a grocery store in Olympia, Washington, refused
for religious reasons to carry Plan B, it was widely boycotted, leading
Gregoire to cancel the grocer's longstanding account with the Washington
Governor's Mansion.^([13]) The only complaints for violating the Plan B
rule were filed against the grocer.^([13]) Half of Washington's
hospitals are Catholic.^([15]) The grocer sued but, instead of alleging
violations of the broader Constitution of Washington, its attorneys at
the Alliance Defending Freedom and the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty
only filed under the Free Exercise Clause of the United States
Constitution.^([16]) The case is known as Stormans, Inc. v. Wiesman.

On November 8, 2007, U.S. District Judge Ronald B. Leighton granted the
grocer a preliminary injunction blocking the rule.^([17][13]) On May 1,
2008, United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Judges Thomas
G. Nelson and Jay Bybee denied the state a stay of the injunction
pending appeal, over a dissent by Judge A. Wallace Tashima.^([18][13])
However, on July 8, 2009, Circuit Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw, joined by
Richard Clifton and N. Randy Smith reversed the preliminary
injunction.^([19][16])

On February 22, 2012, after four years of discovery and a twelve-day
bench trial, Judge Leighton issued a permanent injunction blocking the
Plan B rule as unconstitutional.^([20]) On July 23, 2015, Circuit Judge
Susan P. Graber, joined by Judges Mary H. Murguia and Richard Clifton
reversed.^([21][22]) The grocer's petition for certiorari from the
Supreme Court of the United States was denied on June 28,
2016.^([23][24]) Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Chief Justice John
Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas, dissented, writing that “the rules
challenged here reflect antipathy towards religious beliefs that do not
accord with the views of those holding the levers of government
power.”^([25][26])

In 2014^([27]) and 2016,^([28]) Senator Cory Booker introduced the
“Access to Birth Control Act” bill, which would require all pharmacists
in the United States to provide emergency contraception.

Responses

[edit]

Health care providers opposed to abortion or contraception support the
clauses because they believe that disciplinary or legal action for
refusing to perform services obliges providers to supply services which
their moral or religious principles forbid.

Reproductive rights organizations, such as Planned Parenthood and NARAL
Pro-Choice America, oppose the provision because they maintain that
pharmacists, doctors, and hospitals have a professional duty to fulfill
patients' legal medical needs, regardless of their own ethical stances.
Opponents see conscience clauses as an attempt to limit reproductive
rights in lieu of bans struck down by Supreme Court rulings such as Roe
v. Wade.^([29]) Though the case has been overturned by Dobbs v. Jackson
Women's Health Organization.

As a result, the term "conscience clause" is controversial and primarily
used by those who support these provisions. Those who oppose them often
prefer to use the term "refusal clause," implying that those who
exercise the clauses are refusing to treat a patient.

In 2018, Roger Severino, the then-Director of the Office for Civil
Rights at the United States Department of Health and Human Services,
criticized those who oppose conscience clauses, saying “[t]here’s a
movement that tries to squelch dissent on the question of abortion so
that those that stand up for life are being systematically driven out of
the medical profession.” He also stated that “[n]obody should be fired
from their position as a medical professional because they refuse to
participate in the taking of a human life in abortion. It’s illegal, if
you receive federal funds. You may expect an enforcement action from the
HHS Office for Civil Rights, if you do such a thing.”^([30])

Catholic doctrine

[edit]

The conscience clause is widely invoked in Catholic universities,
hospitals, and agencies because the Catholic Church opposes abortion,
contraceptives, sterilization, and embryonic stem cell treatments.
Opponents of related FOCA legislation have interpreted the possible end
of the conscience clause as a demand to either "do abortions or
close."^([31]) Timothy Dolan has said, "“In effect, the president is
saying we have a year to figure out how to violate our
consciences."^([32]) However, conscience clauses are sometimes
interpreted differently and their use will often depend on the given
context.^([33])

Three members of the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and
Reproductive Sciences and the Bixby Center for Global Reproductive
Health at UCSF have questioned whether "conscience clauses" are ethical,
writing in a journal article that "in some Catholic-owned hospitals, the
private patient–physician relationship, patient safety, and patient
comfort are compromised by religious mandates that require physicians to
act contrary to the current standard of care in miscarriage
management."^([34])
