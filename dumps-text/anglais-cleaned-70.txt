internal conflict of society s oppressed

not to be confused with dual consciousness



double consciousness is the dual selfperception1 experienced by
subordinated or colonized groups in an oppressive society

 the term and
the idea were first published in w

 e

 b

 du bois s autoethnographic
work the souls of black folk in 1903 in which he described the african
american experience of double consciousness including his own

2

originally double consciousness was specifically the psychological
challenge african americans experienced of always looking at one s self
through the eyes of a racist white society and measuring oneself by
the means of a nation that looked back in contempt

2 the term also
referred to du bois s experiences of reconciling his african heritage
with an upbringing in a europeandominated society

3

origin

edit



title page of a 1903 book in which du bois essay about
doubleconsciousness was republished

the term was introduced by ralph waldo emerson in his 1842 essay the
transcendentalist

 du bois first used the term in an article titled
strivings of the negro people published in the august 1897 issue of
the atlantic monthly

4 it was later republished and slightly edited
under the title of our spiritual strivings in his book the souls of
black folk

 du bois describes double consciousness as follows

 it is a peculiar sensation this doubleconsciousness this sense of
 always looking at one s self through the eyes of others of measuring
 one s soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and
 pity

 one ever feels his twoness—an american a negro two souls
 two thoughts two unreconciled strivings two warring ideals in one
 dark body whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn
 asunder

 the history of the american negro is the history of this
 strife – this longing to attain selfconscious manhood to merge his
 double self into a better and truer self

 in this merging he wishes
 neither of the older selves to be lost

 he does not wish to africanize
 america for america has too much to teach the world and africa

 he
 wouldn t bleach his negro blood in a flood of white americanism for
 he knows that negro blood has a message for the world

 he simply
 wishes to make it possible for a man to be both a negro and an
 american without being cursed and spit upon by his fellows without
 having the doors of opportunity closed roughly in his face

modern conceptions

edit

the concept of double consciousness has been expanded on by many
different scholars in the 20th and early 21st centuries

 commentators
have examined how the concept can be expanded to other aspects of the
african american experience or for other marginalized groups who
experience a similar forms of oppression

gilroy and the black atlantic

edit

paul gilroy applied theories of culture and race to the study and
construction of african american intellectual history

 he is known
especially for marking a turning point in the study of the african
diasporas

6 his book the black atlantic modernity and double
consciousness 1993 introduces the black atlantic as a source for
cultural construction

7 gilroy pioneers a shift in contemporary
black studies by arguing for a rejection of the notion of a homogeneous
nationstate based nationality in favor of analyzing the atlantic as
one single complex unit of analysis in their discussions of the modern
world and use it to produce an explicitly transnational and
intercultural perspective

8 he based this on the atlantic slave
trade and marked it as the foundation for the diaspora

 he recognized
the significance of european and african transnational travel as a
foundation for double consciousness

 gilroy used du bois s theory of
double consciousness to suggest there exists an internal struggle to
reconcile being both european and black which was his main focus in his
book

7 he even characterized the black atlantic by the influence of
slave trade routes on black identity

 he aimed to unify black culture
with the connection to the homeland as well as the cultural exchanges
that occurred afterward

 gilroy s work became popular with the black
diaspora in europe and his theories became the foundation for several
black power movements throughout the continent

9

gilroy argues that occupying the space between these two dialectal
subjectivities is viewed as a provocative and even oppositional act of
political insubordination

8 this means that for black people
across diaspora thinking of the duality in their identity as one is
almost paradoxical and conceptualizing and actualizing this is a move
of symbolic resistance in modernity

frantz fanon

edit

very similarly to du bois frantz fanon touched upon the term of double
consciousness in his life

 in his first book black skin white masks
where he expressed his hopelessness at being neither white nor black


fanon identifies the double consciousness that african americans face
and its source he claimed the cultural and social confusions of african
americans were caused by european culture

10 he gave examples of
things that he has encountered that demonstrate the double
consciousness

 he talks about people who preach about completely
conforming to being white and says that they are wrong

 he also says
that the people who believe that complete rejection of whites are also
wrong

11

he then proceeds to talk about why black people adopt cultures that are
so strange to him

 he talks about how when a black caribbean leaves for
europe they come back speaking a language different from their own

 he
also talks about how africans mostly the wealthiest tend to have
insecurities of not being european enough because they are african

 this
manifests in buying european furniture and buying european
clothes

11

in addition to this he talks about the way white men talk to african
americans and how it contributes to this problem of double
consciousness

 he says that when a white man talks to an african
american man he is changing his language to a way in which a
stereotypical black man would talk similarly to how one would talk to a
child with different language sophistication and slang

 he says that
this angers the african american because he feels as though he has been
categorized and imprisoned into a box from which he cannot escape due to
this judgement

 he gives an example of a film where this stereotype is
portrayed and then talks about how african americans need to be educated
to not follow the stereotypes displayed by white culture

12

stephen greenblatt also uses it to describe the peculiar quality of
shakespeare s consciousness in his biography of the bard will in the
world 2004

13

triple consciousness

edit

in the 21st century du bois s theory of double consciousness has been
revisited to develop a more inclusive concept of triple consciousness


this triple consciousness may include another intersecting identity that
impacts a person s social experiences

 additional identities that may
affect the already present double consciousness experience might include
ethnicity gender sexual orientation etc

 for example juan flores
identified ethnicity as a potential aspect that influences double
consciousness by speculating afrolatinos in the u

s

 experienced an
added layer of discrimination that combined skin color with ethnicity
and nationality

14 anna julia cooper similarly references the
intersectionality of race and gender within her work a voice from the
south where she states only the black woman can say when and where i
enter in the quiet undisputed dignity of my womanhood without
violence and without suing or special patronage then and there the
whole 





 race enters with me

15 finally jossianna arroyo
explains that triple consciousness brings spaces culture and skin 






to recontextualize blackness16 in the case of black puerto
ricans



experiences of women of color

edit

just like any other thought in critical race analysis double
consciousness theory cannot be divorced from gender

 this is where black
feminists have introduced their concept of the triple
consciousness

17 black women not only have to see themselves
through the lens of blackness and whiteness but also through the lens
of patriarchy

 whenever they are in black spaces women still have to
situate themselves in the context of patriarchy

 whenever they are in
fem spaces they must still situate themselves in the context of their
blackness

 deborah gray white writes african american women are
confronted with an impossible task

 if she is rescued from the myth of
the negro the myth of the woman traps her

 if she escapes the myth of
the women the myth of the negro still ensnares her

18

among the double burdens that feminists faced was fighting for women s
rights as well as rights for people of color

 frances m

 beale wrote
that the situation of black women was full of misconceptions and
distortions of the truth

 in her pamphlet double jeopardy to be black
and female she claimed that capitalism was the direct forebear of
racism because the system was indirectly a way to destroy the humanity
of black people

19

in any society where men are not yet free women are less free because
we are further enslaved because we african american women are enslaved
by our sex

 many african american women turned towards feminism in
their fight against oppression because there was an awareness that they
were being treated as secondclass citizens within the civil rights
movement of the 60 s

 due to this many women felt that they were being
asked to choose between a black movement that primarily served the
interest of black male patriarchs and a women s movement which
primarily served the interests of racist white women



the theory of double consciousness is also heavily present for female
diasporic artists

 these artists are faced with the task of remaining
authentic to their roots while still branding themselves in a way to
allow international and mainstream popularity

 in the music industry
women of color are often stereotyped as being hypersexual and
aggressive which in some cases helps their branding and in other
cases it hurts their branding and the identity they have attempted to
create for themselves

 due to this diasporic female artists are often
forced to privilege certain self markers and conceal others depending on
the situation often making them feel as if they can never create one
true identity for themselves but must rather change depending on the
circumstances present

black power

edit

the first portion of black power the politics of liberation labeled
white power by kwame ture formerly known as stokely carmichael and
charles v

 hamilton provides evidence backing up the ideology of double
consciousness in regards to black people in the united states

 the book
opens up by defining racism as the predication of decisions and
policies on considerations of race for the purpose of subordinating a
racial group and maintaining control over that group hamilton ture
3

 therefore the subordinate group black people must think of
themselves in terms of the oppressive population white

 individual
racism and institutional racism both contribute to double consciousness


on an individual level double consciousness is practiced within every
day interactions and on an institutional level it impacts how black
people function throughout society

 black people are legal citizens of
the united states with for the most part the same legal rights as
other citizens

 yet they stand as colonial subjects in relation to the
white society

20 therefore while the black population in the
united states are essentially equal to whites under written law there
remain deeply rooted inequities between the races that reinforce double
consciousness

 because these differences are not evident under the u

s


constitution and the bill of rights they are an experience



in the afrogerman paradigm

edit

even though the framework of double consciousness can be applied to an
african diaspora and transnationality the nuances of racial dynamics
differ from nation to nation

 in germany for example the political
exigencies enforced by the third reich created a more nuanced situation


tina campt notes in other germans black germans and the politics of
race gender and memory in the third reich the tension for
afrogermans who came of age during the totalitarian regime of the
third reich 





 was not necessarily experienced as one of absolute
duality or twoness

 rather it was a contradictory and complexly
textured form of identity

21 due to the absence of a black
community in germany most afrogermans did not have the option of
choosing between a black community or identity and a german
identity

21 they were essentially forced to occupy a position
between a conception of german identity that excluded blackness and a
conception of blackness that precluded any identification with
germanness

21 this means that for black germans during the third
reich the psychological dilemmas of twoness did not necessarily map
onto the double consciousness dynamic w

 e

 b

 du bois first identified
in 1897

 for black germans in the early 20th century there was no
stable idea or community of blackness with which they could fully or
even partly identify
