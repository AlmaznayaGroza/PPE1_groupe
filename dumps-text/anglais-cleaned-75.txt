article summary

philosophers have used the term consciousness for four main topics
knowledge in general intentionality introspection and the knowledge
it specifically generates and phenomenal experience

 this entry
discusses the last two uses

 something within one s mind is
 introspectively conscious just in case one introspects it or is
poised to do so

 introspection is often thought to deliver one s
primary knowledge of one s mental life

 an experience or other mental
entity is phenomenally conscious just in case there is something it
is like for one to have it

 the clearest examples are perceptual
experiences such as tastings and seeings bodilysensational
experiences such as those of pains tickles and itches imaginative
experiences such as those of one s own actions or perceptions and
streams of thought as in the experience of thinking in words or in
images 

 introspection and phenomenality seem independent or
dissociable although this is controversial



phenomenally conscious experiences have been argued to be nonphysical
or at least inexplicable in the manner of other physical entities


several such arguments allege that phenomenal experience is
 subjective that understanding some experiences requires undergoing
them or their components

 the claim is that any objective physical
science would leave an explanatory gap failing to describe what it is
like to have a particular experience and failing to explain why there
are phenomenal experiences at all

 from this some philosophers infer
 dualism rather than physicalism about consciousness concluding that
some facts about consciousness are not wholly constituted by physical
facts

 this dualist conclusion threatens claims that phenomenal
consciousness has causal power and that it is knowable in others and in
oneself



in reaction surprisingly much can be said in favour of eliminativism 
about phenomenal consciousness the denial of any realm of phenomenal
objects and properties of experience

 most but not all philosophers
deny that there are phenomenal objects – mental images with colour and
shape painobjects that throb or burn inner speech with pitch and
rhythm and so on

 instead experiences may simply seem to involve such
objects

 the central disagreement concerns whether these experiences
have phenomenal properties – qualia particular aspects of what
experiences are like for their bearers

 some philosophers deny that
there are phenomenal properties – especially if these are thought to be
intrinsic completely and immediately introspectible ineffable
subjective or otherwise potentially difficult to explain on physicalist
theories

 more commonly philosophers acknowledge qualia of experiences
either articulating less bold conceptions of qualia or defending
dualism about boldly conceived qualia



introspective consciousness has seemed less puzzling than phenomenal
consciousness

 most thinkers agree that introspection is far from
complete about the mind and far from infallible

 perhaps the most
familiar account of introspection is that in addition to outwardly
perceiving nonmental entities in one s environment and body one
 inwardly perceives one s mental entities as when one seems to see
visual images with one s mind s eye 

 this view faces several serious
objections

 rival views of introspective consciousness fall into three
categories according to whether they treat introspective access 1 as
epistemically looser or less direct than inner perception 2 as
tighter or more direct or 3 as fundamentally nonepistemic or
nonrepresentational

 theories in category 1 explain introspection as
always retrospective or as typically based on selfdirected theoretical
inferences

 rivals from category 2 maintain that an introspectively
conscious mental state reflexively represents itself or treat
introspection as involving no mechanism of access at all

 category 3
theories treat a mental state as introspectively conscious if it is
distinctively available for linguistic or rational processing even if
it is not itself perceived or otherwise thought about
