is consciousness universal



panpsychism the ancient doctrine that consciousness is universal
offers some lessons in how to think about subjective experience today

by christof koch

for every inside there is an outside and for every outside there is an
inside though they are different they go together


—alan watts man nature and the nature of man 1991

i grew up in a devout and practicing roman catholic family with purzel
a fearless and highenergy dachshund

 he as with all the other much
larger dogs that subsequently accompanied me through life showed plenty
of affection curiosity playfulness aggression anger shame and fear


yet my church teaches that whereas animals as god s creatures ought to
be treated well they do not possess an immortal soul

 only humans do


even as a child to me this belief felt intuitively wrong

 these
gorgeous creatures had feelings just like i did

 why deny them

 why
would god resurrect people but not dogs

 this core christian belief in
human exceptionalism did not make any sense to me

 whatever
consciousness and mind are and no matter how they relate to the brain
and the rest of the body i felt that the same principle must hold for
people and dogs and by extension for other animals as well



it was only later at university that i became acquainted with buddhism
and its emphasis on the universal nature of mind

 indeed when i spent a
week with his holiness the dalai lama earlier in 2013 see “the brain of
buddha” consciousness redux scientific american mind julyaugust
2013 i noted how often he talked about the need to reduce the
suffering of “all living beings” and not just “all people

” my readings
in philosophy brought me to panpsychism the view that mind psyche is
found everywhere pan

 panpsychism is one of the oldest of all
philosophical doctrines extant and was put forth by the ancient greeks
in particular thales of miletus and plato

 philosopher baruch spinoza
and mathematician and universal genius gottfried wilhelm leibniz who
laid down the intellectual foundations for the age of enlightenment
argued for panpsychism as did philosopher arthur schopenhauer father
of american psychology william james and jesuit paleontologist teilhard
de chardin

 it declined in popularity with the rise of positivism in the
20th century

as a natural scientist i find a version of panpsychism modified for the
21st century to be the single most elegant and parsimonious explanation
for the universe i find myself in

 there are three broad reasons why
panpsychism is appealing to the modern mind



we are all nature s children

the past two centuries of scientific progress have made it difficult to
sustain a belief in human exceptionalism



consider my bernese mountain dog ruby when she yelps whines gnaws at
her paw limps and then comes to me seeking aid i infer that she is in
pain because under similar conditions i behave in similar ways sans
gnawing

 physiological measures of pain confirm this inference—injured
dogs just like people experience an elevated heart rate and blood
pressure and release stress hormones into their bloodstream

 i m not
saying that a dog s pain is exactly like human pain but dogs—as well as
other animals—not only react to noxious stimuli but also consciously
experience pain



all species—bees octopuses ravens crows magpies parrots tuna
mice whales dogs cats and monkeys—are capable of sophisticated
learned nonstereotyped behaviors that would be associated with
consciousness if a human were to carry out such actions

 precursors of
behaviors thought to be unique to people are found in many species

 for
instance bees are capable of recognizing specific faces from
photographs can communicate the location and quality of food sources to
their sisters via the waggle dance and can navigate complex mazes with
the help of cues they store in shortterm memory for instance “after
arriving at a fork take the exit marked by the color at the entrance”


bees can fly several kilometers and return to their hive a remarkable
navigational performance

 and a scent blown into the hive can trigger a
return to the site where the bees previously encountered this odor

 this
type of associative memory was famously described by marcel proust in à
la recherche du temps perdu

 other animals can recognize themselves
know when their conspecifics observe them and can lie and cheat



some people point to language and the associated benefits as being the
unique defining feature of consciousness

 conveniently this viewpoint
rules out all but one species homo sapiens which has an ineradicable
desire to come out on top as having sentience

 yet there is little
reason to deny consciousness to animals preverbal infants see “the
conscious infant” consciousness redux scientific american mind
septemberoctober 2013 or patients with severe aphasia all of whom are
mute



none other than charles darwin in the last book he published in the
year preceding his death set out to learn how far earthworms “acted
consciously and how much mental power they displayed

” studying their
feeding and sexual behaviors for several decades—darwin was after all a
naturalist with uncanny powers of observation—he concluded that there
was no absolute threshold between lower and higher animals including
humans that assigned higher mental powers to one but not to the other



the nervous systems of all these creatures are highly complex

 their
constitutive proteins genes synapses cells and neuronal circuits are
as sophisticated variegated and specialized as anything seen in the
human brain

 it is difficult to find anything exceptional about the
human brain

 even its size is not so special because elephants
dolphins and whales have bigger brains

 only an expert neuroanatomist
armed with a microscope can tell a grainsize piece of cortex of a
mouse from that of a monkey or a human

 biologists emphasize this
structural and behavioral continuity by distinguishing between nonhuman
and human animals

 we are all nature s children



given the lack of a clear and compelling rubicon separating simple from
complex animals and simple from complex behaviors the belief that only
humans are capable of experiencing anything consciously seems
preposterous

 a much more reasonable assumption is that until proved
otherwise many if not all multicellular organisms experience pain and
pleasure and can see and hear the sights and sounds of life

 for brains
that are smaller and less complex the creatures conscious experience
is very likely to be less nuanced less differentiated and more
elemental

 even a worm has perhaps the vaguest sense of being alive

 of
course each species has its own unique sensorium matched to its
ecological niche

 not every creature has ears to hear and eyes to see


yet all are capable of having at least some subjective feelings



the austere appeal of panpsychism

taken literally panpsychism is the belief that everything is
“enminded

” all of it

 whether it is a brain a tree a rock or an
electron

 everything that is physical also possesses an interior mental
aspect

 one is objective—accessible to everybody—and the other
phenomenal—accessible only to the subject

 that is the sense of the
quotation by britishborn buddhist scholar alan watts with which i began
this essay



i will defend a narrowed more nuanced view namely that any complex
system as defined below has the basic attributes of mind and has a
minimal amount of consciousness in the sense that it feels like
something to be that system

 if the system falls apart consciousness
ceases to be it doesn t feel like anything to be a broken system

 and
the more complex the system the larger the repertoire of conscious
states it can experience



my subjective experience and yours too presumably the cartesian “i
think therefore i am” is an undeniable certainty one strong enough to
hold the weight of philosophy

 but from whence does this experience
come

 materialists invoke something they call emergentism to explain how
consciousness can be absent in simple nervous systems and emerge as
their complexity increases

 consider the wetness of water its ability
to maintain contact with surfaces

 it is a consequence of intermolecular
interactions notably hydrogen bonding among nearby water molecules

 one
or two molecules of h₂o are not wet but put gazillions together at the
right temperature and pressure and wetness emerges

 or see how the laws
of heredity emerge from the molecular properties of dna rna and
proteins

 by the same process mind is supposed to arise out of
sufficiently complex brains



yet the mental is too radically different for it to arise gradually from
the physical

 this emergence of subjective feelings from physical stuff
appears inconceivable and is at odds with a basic precept of physical
thinking the urconservation law—ex nihilo nihil fit

 so if there is
nothing there in the first place adding a little bit more won t make
something

 if a small brain won t be able to feel pain why should a
large brain be able to feel the godawfulness of a throbbing toothache


why should adding some neurons give rise to this ineffable feeling

 the
phenomenal hails from a kingdom other than the physical and is subject
to different laws

 i see no way for the divide between unconscious and
conscious states to be bridged by bigger brains or more complex neurons



a more principled solution is to assume that consciousness is a basic
feature of certain types of socalled complex systems defined in some
universal mathematical manner

 and that complex systems have
sensation whereas simple systems have none

 this reasoning is analogous
to the arguments made by savants studying electrical charge in the 18th
century

 charge is not an emergent property of living things as
originally thought when electricity was discovered in the twitching
muscles of frogs

 there are no uncharged particles that in the aggregate
produce an electrical charge

 elementary particles either have some
charge or they have none

 thus an electron has one negative charge a
proton has one positive charge and a photon the carrier of light has
zero charge

 as far as chemistry and biology are concerned charge is an
intrinsic property of these particles

 electrical charge does not emerge
from noncharged matter

 it is the same goes the logic with
consciousness

 consciousness comes with organized chunks of matter

 it
is immanent in the organization of the system

 it is a property of
complex entities and cannot be further reduced to the action of more
elementary properties

 we have reached the ground floor of reductionism



yet as traditionally conceived panpsychism suffers from two major
flaws

 one is known as the problem of aggregates

 philosopher john
searle of the university of california berkeley expressed it recently
“consciousness cannot spread over the universe like a thin veneer of
jam there has to be a point where my consciousness ends and yours
begins

” indeed if consciousness is everywhere why should it not
animate the iphone the internet or the united states of america


furthermore panpsychism does not explain why a healthy brain is
conscious whereas the same brain placed inside a blender and reduced
to goo would not be

 that is it does not explain how aggregates
combine to produce specific conscious experience



integrated panpsychism

these centuryold arguments bring me to the conceptual framework of the
integrated information theory iit of psychiatrist and neuroscientist
giulio tononi of the university of wisconsin–madison

 it postulates that
conscious experience is a fundamental aspect of reality and is identical
to a particular type of information—integrated information


consciousness depends on a physical substrate but is not reducible to
it

 that is my experience of seeing an aquamarine blue is inexorably
linked to my brain but is different from my brain



any system that possesses some nonzero amount of integrated information
experiences something

 let me repeat any system that has even one bit
of integrated information has a very minute conscious experience



iit makes two principled assumptions

 first conscious states are highly
differentiated they are informationally very rich

 you can be conscious
of an uncountable number of things

 think of all the frames from all the
movies that you have ever seen or that have ever been filmed or that
will be filmed

 each frame each view is a specific conscious percept



second each such experience is highly integrated

 you cannot force
yourself to see the world in black and white its color is an integrated
part of your view

 whatever information you are conscious of is wholly
and completely presented to your mind it cannot be subdivided


underlying this unity of consciousness is a multitude of causal
interactions among the relevant parts of your brain

 if parts of the
brain become fragmented and balkanized as occurs in deep sleep or in
anesthesia consciousness fades



to be conscious then you need to be a single integrated entity with a
large repertoire of highly differentiated states

 even if the hard disk
on my laptop exceeds in capacity my lifetime memories none of its
information is integrated

 the family photos on my mac are not linked to
one another

 the computer does not know that the boy in those pictures
is my son as he matures from a toddler to an awkward teenager and then a
graceful adult

 to my computer all information is equally meaningless
just a vast random tapestry of 0s and 1s

 yet i derive meaning from
these images because my memories are heavily crosslinked

 and the more
interconnected the more meaningful they become



these ideas can be precisely expressed in the language of mathematics
using notions from information theory such as entropy

 given a
particular brain with its neurons in a particular state—these neurons
are firing while those ones are quiet—one can precisely compute the
extent to which this network is integrated

 from this calculation the
theory derives a single number phgr pronounced “fi” see “a theory
of consciousness” consciousness redux scientific american mind
julyaugust 2009

 measured in bits phgr denotes the size of the
conscious repertoire associated with the network of causally interacting
parts being in one particular state

 think of phgr as the synergy of
the system

 the more integrated the system is the more synergy it has
and the more conscious it is

 if individual brain regions are too
isolated from one another or are interconnected at random phgr will be
low

 if the organism has many neurons and is richly endowed with
synaptic connections phgr will be high

 basically phgr captures the
quantity of consciousness

 the quality of any one experience—the way in
which red feels different from blue and a color is perceived differently
from a tone—is conveyed by the informational geometry associated with
phgr

 the theory assigns to any one brain state a shape a crystal in
a fantastically highdimensional qualia space

 this crystal is the
system viewed from within

 it is the voice in the head the light inside
the skull

 it is everything you will ever know of the world

 it is your
only reality

 it is the quiddity of experience

 the dream of the lotus
eater the mindfulness of the meditating monk and the agony of the
cancer patient all feel the way they do because of the shape of the
distinct crystals in a space of a trillion dimensions—truly a beatific
vision

 the water of integrated information is turned into the wine of
experience



integrated information makes very specific predictions about which brain
circuits are involved in consciousness and which ones are peripheral
players even though they might contain many more neurons their
anatomical wiring differs

 the theory has most recently been used to
build a consciousness meter to assess in a quantitative manner the
extent to which anesthetized subjects or severely braininjured
patients such as terri schiavo who died in florida in 2005 are truly
not conscious or do have some conscious experiences but are unable to
signal their pain and discomfort to their loved ones see “a
consciousness meter” consciousness redux scientific american mind
marchapril 2013



iit addresses the problem of aggregates by postulating that only “local
maxima” of integrated information exist over elements and spatial and
temporal scales my consciousness your consciousness but nothing in
between

 that is every person living in the u

s

 is self by self
conscious but there is no superordinate consciousness of the u

s


population as a whole



unlike classical panpsychism not all physical objects have a phgr that
is different from zero

 only integrated systems do

 a bunch of
disconnected neurons in a dish a heap of sand a galaxy of stars or a
black hole—none of them are integrated

 they have no consciousness

 they
do not have mental properties



last iit does not discriminate between squishy brains inside skulls and
silicon circuits encased in titanium

 provided that the causal relations
among the circuit elements transistors and other logic gates give rise
to integrated information the system will feel like something

 consider
humankind s largest and most complex artifact the internet

 it consists
of billions of computers linked together using optical fibers and copper
cables that rapidly instantiate specific connections using ultrafast
communication protocols

 each of these processors in turn is made out of
a few billion transistors

 taken as a whole the internet has perhaps 10

¹⁹ transistors about the number of synapses in the brains of 10000
people

 thus its sheer number of components exceeds that of any one
human brain

 whether or not the internet today feels like something to
itself is completely speculative

 still it is certainly conceivable



when i talk and write about panpsychism i often encounter blank stares
of incomprehension

 such a belief violates people s strongly held
intuition that sentience is something only humans and a few closely
related species possess

 yet our intuition also fails when we are first
told as kids that a whale is not a fish but a mammal or that people on
the other side of the planet do not fall off because they are upside
down

 panpsychism is an elegant explanation for the most basic of all
brute facts i encounter every morning on awakening there is subjective
experience

 tononi s theory offers a scientific constructive
predictive and mathematically precise form of panpsychism for the 21st
century

 it is a gigantic step in the final resolution of the ancient
mindbody problem
