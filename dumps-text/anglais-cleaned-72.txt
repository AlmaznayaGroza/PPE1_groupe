selfconsciousness

first published thu jul 13 2017 substantive revision fri jun 14 2024

human beings are conscious not only of the world around them but also of
themselves their activities their bodies and their mental lives

 they
are that is selfconscious or equivalently selfaware


selfconsciousness can be understood as an awareness of oneself

 but a
selfconscious subject is not just aware of something that merely
happens to be themselves as one is if one sees an old photograph
without realising that it is of oneself

 rather a selfconscious subject
is aware of themselves as themselves it is manifest to them that they
themselves are the object of awareness

 selfconsciousness is a form of
consciousness that is paradigmatically expressed in english by the words
“i” “me” and “my” terms that each of us uses to refer to ourselves as
such



a central topic throughout the history of philosophy—and increasingly so
since the seventeenth century—the phenomena surrounding
selfconsciousness prompt a variety of fundamental philosophical and
scientific questions including its relation to consciousness its
semantic and epistemic features its realisation in both conceptual and
nonconceptual representation and its connection to our conception of
an objective world populated with others like ourselves

 selfconsciousness in the history of philosophy

a familiar feature of ancient greek philosophy and culture is the
delphic maxim “know thyself”

 but what is it that one knows if one knows
oneself

 in sophocles oedipus oedipus knows a number of things about
himself for example that he was prophesied to kill laius

 but although
he knew this about himself it is only later in the play that he comes
to know that it is he himself of whom it is true

 that is he moves from
thinking that the son of laius and jocasta was prophesied to kill laius
to thinking that he himself was so prophesied

 it is only this latter
knowledge that we would call an expression of selfconsciousness and
that we may presume is the object of the delphic maxim

 during the
course of the drama oedipus comes to know himself with tragic
consequences

 but just what this selfconsciousness amounts to and how
it might be connected to other aspects of the mind most notably
consciousness itself is less clear

 it has perhaps unsurprisingly
been the topic of considerable discussion since the greeks

 during the
early modern period selfconsciousness became central to a number of
philosophical issues and with kant and the postkantians came to be
seen as one of the most important topics in epistemology and the
philosophy of mind

1 ancient and medieval discussions of selfconsciousness

although it is occasionally suggested that a concern with
selfconsciousness is a peculiarly modern phenomenon originating with
descartes brinkmann 2005 it is in fact the topic of lively ancient
and medieval debates many of which prefigure early modern and
contemporary concerns sorabji 2006

 aristotle for example claims
that a person must while perceiving any thing also perceive their own
existence de sensu 7

448a a claim suggestive of the view that
consciousness entails selfconsciousness

 furthermore according to
aristotle since the intellect takes on the form of that which is
thought kahn 1992 it “is thinkable just as the thoughtobjects are”
de anima 3

4

430 an assertion that was interpreted by aristotle s
medieval commentators as the view that selfawareness depends on an
awareness of extramental things cory 2014 ch

 1 owens 1988



by contrast the platonic tradition principally through the influence
of augustine writing in the fourth and fifth centuries is associated
with the view that the mind “gains the knowledge of itself through
itself” on the trinity 9

3 matthews 1992 cary 2000 by being present
to itself

 thus on this view selfawareness requires no awareness of
outer things

 in a similar vein in the eleventh century avicenna
argues by way of his flying man thought experiment that a newly
created person floating in a void with all senses disabled would
nevertheless be selfaware

 thus the self that one cognises cannot be a
bodily thing of which one is aware through the senses kaukua kukkonen
2007 black 2008 kaukua 2015

 on such views and in contrast to the
aristotelian picture basic selfawareness is neither sensory in nature
nor dependent on the awareness of other things

 this latter claim was
accepted by aquinas writing in the thirteenth century who can be seen
as synthesising aspects of the platonic and aristotelian traditions
cory 2014

 for not only does aquinas claim that there is a form of
selfawareness—awareness that one exists—for which “the mere presence
of the mind suffices” there is another form—awareness of one s
essence—that as aristotle had claimed is dependent on cognising other
things and so for which “the mere presence of the mind does not suffice”
summa 1 87 1 kenny 1993 ch

 10



this ancient and medieval debate concerning whether the mere presence of
the mind is sufficient for selfawareness is related to another
concerning whether selfawareness is itself sensory in character or put
another way whether the self is or is not perceptible

 aquinas has
sometimes been interpreted as offering a positive answer to this
question sometimes a negative answer see pasnau 2002 ch

 11 and cory
2014 ch

 4 for differing views

 these issues were also discussed in
various indian hindu jain and buddhist debates albahari 2006
siderits thompson zahavi 2013 ganeri 2012ab with a variety of
perspectives represented

 for example in the writing of the eleventh
century jain writer prabhācandra there appears an argument very much
like avicenna s flying man argument for the possibility of
selfawareness without awareness of the body ganeri 2012a ch

 2
whereas various thinkers of the advaita vendānta school argue that there
is no selfawareness without embodiment ramprasad 2013

 there were
therefore wideranging debates in the ancient and medieval period not
only about the nature of selfconsciousness but also about its relation
to other aspects of the mind most notably sensory perception and
awareness of the body

2 early modern discussions of selfconsciousness

central to the early modern discussion of selfconsciousness are
descartes assertions in the second of his meditations that “i am i
exist is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived
in my mind” descartes 1641 80 and in both his discourse and
principles that “i think therefore i am” or “cogito ergo sum”
descartes 1637 36 and descartes 1644 162 see the discussion of
reflection in the entry on seventeenth century theories of
consciousness

 the cogito which was anticipated by augustine on the
trinity 10

10 pasnau 2002 ch

 11 embodies two elements of
selfawareness—awareness that one is thinking and awareness that one
exists—that play a foundational role in descartes epistemological
project

 as such it is crucial for descartes that the cogito is
something of which we can be absolutely certain

 but whilst most
commentators are happy to agree that both “i am thinking” and “i exist”
are indubitable there is a great deal of debate over the grounds for
such certainty and over the form of the cogito itself hintikka 1962
wilson 1978 ch

 2 §2 b

 williams 1978 ch

 3 markie 1992

 of
particular concern is the question whether these two propositions are
known by inference or noninferentially e

g

 by intuition an issue
that echoes the medieval debates concerning whether one can be said to
perceive oneself



one philosopher who accepts the former intuitionbased account is
locke who claims that

 we have an intuitive knowledge of our own existence and an internal
 infallible perception that we are

 in every act of sensation
 reasoning or thinking we are conscious to ourselves of our own
 being

 1700 iv

ix

3

a similar claim can be found in berkeley s three dialogues 1713
231–234 stoneham 2002 §6

4

 further locke makes selfconsciousness
partly definitive of the very concept of a person a person being “a
thinking intelligent being that has reason and reflection and can
consider it self as it self the same thinking thing in different times
and places” 1700 ii

 xxvii

9 ayers 1991 vol

ii ch

23 thiel 2011
ch

 4 and selfconsciousness also plays an important role in his
theory of personal identity see §4

1



if descartes locke and berkeley can be interpreted as accepting the
view that there is an inner perception of the self on this question
hume stands in stark contrast notoriously writing that whilst

 there are some philosophers who imagine we are every moment
 intimately conscious of what we call our self for my part when i
 enter most intimately into what i call myself i always stumble on
 some particular perception or other of heat or cold light or shade
 love or hatred pain or pleasure

 i never can catch myself at any time
 without a perception and never can observe anything but the
 perception

 hume 1739–40 bk

 1 thiel
 2011 ch

 12 cf

 lichtenberg s famous remark that one should not say
 “i think” but rather “it thinks” discussed in zöller 1992 burge
 1998 gomes 2024 ch

3

hume s view that there is no impression or perception of oneself is
crucial to his case for the understanding of our idea of ourselves as
nothing more than a “heap or collection of different perceptions”
1739–40 bk

1 ch

4 §6 penelhum 2000 g

 strawson 2011a since
lacking an impression of the owner of these perceptions we must in
accordance with his empiricist account of concept acquisition lack an
idea of such

 it is clear then that in the early modern period issues
of selfconsciousness play an important role in a variety of
philosophical questions regarding persons and their minds

3 kantian and postkantian discussions of selfconsciousness

hume s denial that there is an inner perception of the self as the owner
of experience is one that is echoed in kant s discussion in both the
transcendental deduction and the paralogisms where he writes that there
is no intuition of the self “through which it is given as object” kant
17811787 b408 brook 1994 ameriks 1982 2000

 kant s account of
selfconsciousness and its significance is complex a central element of
the transcendental deduction being the claim that a form of
selfawareness—transcendental apperception—is required to account for
the unity of conscious experience over time

 in kant s words “the i
think must be able to accompany all my representations” kant
17811787 b132 keller 1998 kitcher 2011 see the entry on kant s view
of the mind and consciousness of self

 thus while kant denies that
there is an inner awareness of the self as an object that owns its
experiences we must nevertheless be aware of those experiences as
things that are both individually and collectively our own

 the
representation of the self in this “i think” is then according to kant
purely formal exhausted by its function in unifying experience



the kantian account of selfawareness and its relation to the capacity
for objective thought set the agenda for a great deal of postkantian
philosophy

 on the nature of selfawareness for example in an
unpublished manuscript schopenhauer concurs with kant asserting that
“that the subject should become an object for itself is the most
monstrous contradiction ever thought of” quoted in janaway 1989 120


further a philosophical tradition stemming from kant s work has tried
to identify the necessary conditions of the possibility of
selfconsciousness with p

f

 strawson 1959 1966 evans 1980 1982
and cassam 1997 for example exploring the relation between the
capacity for selfconscious thought and the possession of a conception
of oneself as an embodied agent located within an objective world see
§4

3

 another related tradition has argued that an awareness of
subjects other than oneself is a necessary condition of
selfconsciousness see §4

4

 historical variations on such a view can
be found in fichte 1794–1795 wood 2006 hegel 1807 pippin 2010
and from a somewhat different perspective mead 1934 aboulafia 1986



fichte offers the most influential account of selfconsciousness in the
postkantian tradition

 on the reading of the “heidelberg school”
fichte claims that previous accounts of selfconsciousness given by
descartes locke and even kant are “reflective” regarding the self as
taking itself not as subject but as object henrich 1967 tugendhat
1979 ch

 3 frank 2004 zahavi 2007

 but this reflective form of
selfawareness fichte argues presupposes a more primitive form since
it is necessary for the reflecting self to be aware that the reflected
self is in fact itself

 consequently according to fichte we must
possess an immediate acquaintance with ourselves “the self exists and
posits its own existence by virtue of merely existing” fichte
1794–1795 97

 once more this debate echoes ancient discussions
concerning the nature and role of selfconsciousness



1

4 early twentieth century discussions of selfconsciousness

in the early twentieth century frege suggests a form of
selfacquaintance claiming that “everyone is presented to himself in a
special and primitive way” frege 1918–1919 333

 in a similar vein in
early work russell 1910 favours the idea that we are acquainted with
ourselves but by the 1920s 1921 141 he seems to endorse a view more
in line with hume s sceptical account

 the same can be said of the
wittgenstein of the tractatus who famously likens the self to the eye
which sees but does not see itself wittgenstein 1921 5

6–5

641
o brien 1996 sullivan 1996

 husserl s philosophical development seems
to have taken the opposite trajectory to that of russell with his
19001901 investigation v §8 denial of the inner awareness of a
“pure ego” being subsequently revised into something resembling kantian
transcendental apperception husserl 1913 §57 carr 1999 ch

 3 zahavi
2005 ch

 2

 continuing with the phenomenological tradition sartre
1937 priest 2000 takes husserl s later view to task arguing against
the view that we are continually aware of a transcendental ego yet in
favour of the picture of consciousness as involving a “prereflective”
awareness of itself reminiscent of the heidelberg school view wider
1997 ch

 3 miguens preyer morando 2016

 questions about the
nature of selfconsciousness and in particular over whether there is
an immediate or intuitive consciousness of the self were as lively as
ever well into the twentieth century

 selfconsciousness in thought

one natural way to think of selfconsciousness is in terms of a
subject s capacity to entertain conscious thought about herself


selfconscious thoughts are thoughts about oneself

 but it is commonly
pointed out that thinking about what merely happens to be oneself is
insufficient for selfconsciousness rather one must think of oneself as
oneself

 if one is capable of selfconscious thought that is one must
be able to think in such a way that it is manifest to one that it is
oneself about whom one is thinking



it is widely recognised that the paradigmatic linguistic expression of
selfconsciousness in english is the firstperson pronoun “i” a term
with which one might be said to refer to oneself as oneself sainsbury
2011

 plausibly every utterance of a sentence containing “i” is
expressive of a selfconscious “ithought” that is a thought containing
the firstperson concept

 thus discussions of selfconsciousness are
often closely associated with accounts of the semantics of the indexical
term “i” and the nature of its counterpart firstperson concept e

as castañeda 1966 cf

 anscombe 1975 points out there is an ambiguity
in certain ascriptions of belief containing “he” “she” or “they”

 i
may say “jane believes that she is f” without implying that jane
realises that it is herself that she believes to be f

 that is there is
a reading of “jane believes that she is f” that does not imply
selfconsciousness on jane s part

 but in some cases we do intend to
attribute selfconsciousness with that same form of words

 to resolve
this ambiguity castañeda introduces “she” for selfconscious
attributions

 i will use the more natural indirect reflexive “she
herself”

 thus “jane believes that she is f” does not imply that jane
selfconsciously believes that she is f whilst “jane believes that she
herself is f” does

 before the dreadful revelation oedipus believed
that he was prophesied to kill his father but did not believe that he
himself was so prophesied

1 the essential indexical

firstpersonal language and thought is commonly taken to be sui generis
irreducible to language or thought not containing the firstperson
pronoun or corresponding concept castañeda 1966 1967 perry 1977
1979 2001

 arguments for this view have typically appealed to the
essential role seemingly played by the firstperson in explanations of
action see the entry on selflocating beliefs

 this point is supported
by a number of wellknown examples

 consider perry s case of the messy
shopper

 i once followed a trail of sugar on a supermarket floor pushing my
 cart down the aisle on one side of a tall counter and back the aisle
 on the other seeking the shopper with the torn sack to tell him he
 was making a mess

 with each trip around the counter the trail became
 thicker

 but i seemed unable to catch up

 finally it dawned on me

 i
 was the shopper i was trying to catch

 perry 1979 33

as perry points out he knew all along that the shopper with the torn
sack was making a mess

 he may also have believed that the oldest
philosopher in the shop in fact himself was making a mess yet failed
to check his own cart since he falsely believed that quine was at the
deli counter

 indeed it seems that for any nonindexical term a that
denotes perry it is possible for perry to fail to believe anything
naturally expressed by the sentence “i am a”

 if so it is possible for
perry to rationally believe that a is making a mess without believing
anything that he would express as “i am making a mess”

 it was only when
perry came to believe that he himself was making a mess that he stopped
the chase

 indeed it would seem that only the firstpersonal content
can provide an adequate explanation of perry s behaviour when he stops


if perry had come to believe that john perry is making a mess then
unless he also believed that he himself was john perry he would not
have stopped

 the firstpersonal content is “selflocating” thereby
enabling action whereas the nonfirstpersonal content is not

 to use
kaplan s 1977 example if i believe that my pants are on fire pure
selfinterest will surely motivate me do something about it

 if
however i believe that smith s pants are on fire pure selfinterest
will only so motivate me if i also believe that i am smith



on this widely accepted picture then firstpersonal thought and
language is irreducible to nonfirstpersonal thought and language and
is essential to the explanation of action kaplan 1977 533 d

1979 mcginn 1983 ch

 6 recanati 2007 ch

 34 musholt 2015 ch

 1
prosser 2015 garcíacarpintero torre 2016 ninan 2020

 importantly
on perry s view what is irreducible is the firstpersonal way of
thinking about ourselves not the facts or states of affairs that make
such thoughts true

 so whilst my belief “i am f” is not equivalent to
any nonfirstpersonal belief it is true if and only if smith is f
this being the same fact that makes true the nonfirstpersonal “smith
is f”

 thus whilst firstperson representations are special a special
class of firstperson facts are nowhere to be found for views that do
accept the existence of firstpersonal facts see mcginn 1983 baker
2013 builes 2024 also see nagel 1986



perry 1977 1979 argues that terms such as “i” which are as he puts
it “essentially indexical” pose a problem for the traditional fregean
view of belief as a twoplace relation between a subject and a
proposition cf

 spencer 2007

 fregean senses are according to perry
descriptive and as perry has argued no description is equivalent to an
essential indexical

 consequently no fregean proposition can be the
thing believed when one believes firstpersonally

 essential
indexicality if somehow forced into the fregean mould means that we
must implausibly accept that there are incommunicable senses that only
the speaker or thinker is in a position to grasp see
garcíacarpintero torre 2016 cf

evans 1981 longworth 2013

 d


lewis goes further than this arguing partly on the basis of his much
discussed two gods example 1979 in which each god knows all the
propositions true at their world yet fails to know which of the two gods
he himself is that the objects of belief are not propositions at all
but rather properties or centred worlds

 that is since they already
know all the true propositions there is no true proposition the gods
would come to believe when they come to realise which god they are


essential indexicality forces us away from the model of propositions as
the objects of belief

 further lewis claims that not just the
explicitly indexical cases but all belief is in this way selflocating
or in his terminology de se

 on this account every belief involves
the selfascription of a property and so arguably is an instance of
selfconsciousness for discussion gennaro 1996 ch

 3 feit 2008 cappelen dever 2013 ch

 5 magidor 2015 jackson 
stoljar 2020



arguments such as perry s might be challenged on the grounds that it is
not possible to rationally doubt that one is the subject of these
conscious states where that formulation involves an “introspective
demonstrative” picking out one s current conscious states

 this it
might be claimed constitutes a reduction of firstperson content cf


peacocke 1983 ch

 5 although his goal is not reductive

 even if it is
true however that one cannot doubt that one is the subject of these
conscious states it is not clear that this poses a significant
challenge to perry s argument for the essential indexicality of the
firstperson

 for one thing the content itself contains a
demonstrative so indexical element

 second it has been argued that
our capacity to refer to our own experiences itself depends on our
capacity to refer to ourselves as ourselves p

f

 strawson 1959 97
evans 1982 253

 that is to think of these conscious states is to
think of them as these conscious states of mine

 if to demonstratively
think of one s conscious state is necessarily to think of it as one s
own conscious state then the purported reduction of firstperson
thought to thought not containing the firstperson will fail



cappelen and dever 2013 present a sustained attack on the
constellation of philosophical claims surrounding the “essential
indexical” including its purported relation to action and both perry s
and lewis s arguments for it for alternative objections to perry and
lewis see millikan 1990 magidor 2015

 a central element in their
critique is the claim that cases such as perry s shopper that are
often thought to show the special connection between selfconsciousness
ithoughts and the capacity for action really only show that action
explanation contexts do not allow for substitution salva veritate but
rather are opaque cappelen dever 2013 ch

 3

 just as if i am at
the airport waiting for jones i will only signal that man if i believe
him to be jones so if i am looking for the shopper with the torn sack i
will only stop when i believe that i am that shopper

 on their view
despite the popularity of the view to the contrary the capacity for
selfconsciousness does not possess any philosophically deep relation to
the capacity for action

 see the supplement scepticism about essential
indexicality and agency



2

2 firstperson reference

because of its connection with the firstperson pronoun it is often
taken as platitudinous to say that selfconscious thought is closely
associated with the capacity to refer to oneself as oneself

 when i
think selfconsciously i cannot fail to refer to myself

 more than
this it has often been claimed that for a central class of firstperson
thoughts there is no possibility of misidentifying myself not only can
i not fail to pick myself out i cannot take another person to be me


but firstperson reference and indexicality more generally has
sometimes been thought to pose a challenge to theories of reference
requiring special treatment

 indeed some have argued that the platitude
itself should be rejected



terms whose function it is to refer can on occasion fail in that
function

 a use of the term “vulcan” to refer to the planet orbiting
between mercury and the sun fails to refer to anything for the reason
that there is nothing for it to refer to

 if i see the head of one
dachshund protruding from behind a tree and the rear end of another
protruding from the other side of the tree and utter “that dog is
huge” my use of “that dog” has arguably failed to refer due to there
being too many objects

 it would seem that by contrast the term “i”
cannot fail to refer either by there being too few or too many objects


“i” is guaranteed to refer



as an indexical the referent of “i” varies with the context of
utterance see the entry on indexicals

 that is “i” refers to
different people depending on who utters it

 following kaplan 1977 it
is common to think of the meaning of such terms as determining a
function from context to referent

 in the case of “i” a natural
proposal is the “selfreference rule” srr that the referent of a
token of “i” is the person that produces it kaplan 1977 491 campbell
1994 ch

 3

 “i” is thus unlike “this” or “that” a pure indexical
seemingly requiring no overt demonstration or manifestation of intention
kaplan 1977 489–91

 srr captures the plausible thought that “i” is
guaranteed against reference failure

 since every token of “i” has been
produced the fact that “i” refers to its producer means that there is
no chance of its failing to pick out some entity

 this account of “i”
then treats it as not only expressive of selfconsciousness but also
guaranteed to refer to the utterer



srr is kaplan s specification of the character of “i” which is fixed
independently of the context of any particular utterance

 this character
is to be distinguished from the content of a tokening of “i” which it
has only in a context

 on kaplan s account the content of an utterance
of “i am f” will be a singular proposition composed of the person that
produced it and fness recanati 1993 for an account that attributes to
the utterance both singular content and the “reflexive content” the
speaker of this token is f see perry 2001 for an alternative
“neofregean” account in terms of objectdependent de re senses see
evans 1981 cf

 mcdowell 1977 and evans 1982 ch

 1



intuitively plausible as it is srr is open to a number of potential
counterexamples

 suppose for example that you are away from work due
to illness and i leave a note on your door reading “i am not here now”


plausibly whilst it was me that produced this token of “i” it
nevertheless refers to you

 or consider a situation in which i walk into
a petrol station point to my car and say “i m empty”

 in this case it
might be suggested my use of “i” refers to my car rather than myself
for these and related cases see vision 1985 q

 smith 1989 sidelle
1991 nunberg 1993 1995

 if so srr cannot specify the character of
“i” and so arguably some tokens of “i” fail to express the
selfconscious thoughts of those that produce them

 in light of such
cases a variety of alternatives to srr have been proposed

 q

 smith
1989 suggests that “i” is lexically ambiguous predelli 1998ab
2002 offers an intentionbased reference rule for “i” corazza fish
and gorvett 2002 offer a conventionbased account and cohen 2013
argues that the cases can be handled by a conservative modification of
kaplan s original proposal also see romdenhromluc 2002 2008 corazza
2004 ch

 5 dodd sweeney 2010 michaelson 2014 Åkerman 2017



although she didn t have kaplan s formulation of srr in mind an earlier
criticism of such a rule can be found in the work of anscombe 1975 who
argues that the rule cannot be complete as an account of the meaning of
“i” for discussion see o brien 1994

 anscombe considers a world in
which each person has two names one of which ranging from “b” to “z”
is printed on their chest the other in every case “a” is printed on
the inside of their wrist

 each person uses “b” to “z” when attributing
actions to others but “a” when describing their own actions anscombe
1975 49

 anscombe argues that such a situation is compatible with the
possibility that the people in question lack selfconsciousness

 whilst
b uses “a” to refer to b c uses “a” to refer to c and so on there is
no guarantee that they are thinking of themselves as themselves for
they may be reporting what are in fact their own actions without
thinking of those actions as things that they themselves are performing


they may treat themselves that is just as the treat any other

 this is
despite the fact that in this scenario “a” complies with srr



can the selfreference rule be reformulated in such a way as to entail
selfconsciousness on the part of those who use terms that comply with
it

 according to anscombe it can but any such reformulation will
presuppose a prior grasp of selfconscious reference to oneself

 for
example if we say employing the indirect reflexive that “i” is a term
that a person uses to refer to she herself we have travelled in a tight
circle since “she herself” can be understood only in terms of “i”
anscombe 1975 castañeda 1966 for discussion see bermúdez 1998 ch


1 haddock 2019 teichmann 2022 part iv

 this can be seen clearly in
the firstperson formulation of such a rule “i” is a term that i use to
refer to myself

 for here the “myself” must itself be understood as an
expression of selfconsciousness i

e

 we should really say that “i” is
a term that i use to refer to myself as myself



in response to anscombe s argument it has been argued that srr is not
intended to explain the connection between selfconsciousness and the
firstperson o brien 1994 1995a garrett 1998 ch

 7 cf

 campbell
1994 §4

2 peacocke 2008 §3

 on this view all that the example of
“a” users shows is that selfconsciousness has not been fully accounted
for by srr not that srr fails as an account of the character of “i”


kaplan himself however does appear to be more ambitious than this
claiming that the “particular and primitive way” in which each of us is
presented to ourselves is simply that each “is presented to himself
under the character of i ” kaplan 1977 533

 this claim it would
seem is indeed open to anscombe s challenge



anscombe s 1975 paper is perhaps most notable for her claim that “i”
is not a referring expression at all

 assuming that if “i” refers it
must be understood on the model of either a proper name a
demonstrative or an abbreviation of a definite description anscombe
argues that each of these kinds of referring expression requires what
she calls a “conception” by means of which it reaches its referent

 this
conception must explain the seemingly guaranteed reference of “i” the
apparent fact that no token of “i” can fail to pick out an object


however she argues no satisfactory conception can be specified for “i”
since either it fails to deliver up guaranteed reference or it succeeds
but only by delivering an immaterial soul

 since we have independent
reason to believe that there are no immaterial souls it follows that
“i” cannot be understood on the model of a proper name demonstrative or
definite description so is not a referring expression for positive
appraisals of anscombe s position see kenny 1979 malcolm 1979 haddock
2019 and 2022

 criticisms can be found in white 1979 hamilton 1991
brandom 1994 552–561 glock hacker 1996 mcdowell 1998 harcourt
2000 noonan 2022



that “i” does not function as either a name or an abbreviated definite
description is widely accepted

 the more contentious aspect of
anscombe s case for the view that there is no appropriate conception for
“i” is her claim that “i” does not function like a demonstrative

 her
argument for this claim is highly reminiscent of avicenna s flying man
argument see §1

1 with which she was surely familiar

 we can she
tells us imagine a subject in a sensory deprivation tank who has been
anaesthetised and is suffering from amnesia

 such a subject would
claims anscombe be able to think ithoughts perhaps wondering “how
did i get into this mess

”

 since such a subject can think
selfconsciously in the absence of any presented referent it follows
that “i” cannot mean something like “this person” since demonstratives
require the demonstrated object to be presented to conscious awareness


treating “i” on a demonstrative model then fails cf

 campbell 1994
§4

2 o brien 1995b see morgan 2015 for a defence of a demonstrative
account



according to evans 1982 ch

 7 the problem with anscombe s argument
is that it fails to appreciate that “i” can be modelled on “here” rather
than “this”

 according to evans account the similarity between what he
calls “i”ideas and “here”ideas shows up in their functional role for
an alternative broadly functional account see mellor 1989 for an
argument that far from being amenable to a functional analysis
selfconsciousness poses a threat to the coherence of functionalism see
bealer 1997

 once we see how both “i”ideas and “here”ideas stand at
the centre of distinctive networks of inputs ways of gaining
information about ourselves and our locations respectively and outputs
including the explanation of action we can see how to model “i” on
“here” thus escaping anscombe s argument

the supplement evans on first person thought

3 immunity to error through misidentification

in the blue and brown books wittgenstein distinguishes between two uses
of the term “i” which he calls the “use as subject” and the “use as
object” 1958 66–70 garrett 1998 ch

 8 cf

 james distinction
between the i or pure ego and the me or empirical self 1890 vol

 1
ch

 x

 as wittgenstein describes the difference there is a certain
kind of error in thought that is possible when “i” is used as object but
not when “i” is used as subject

 wittgenstein notes that if i find
myself in a tangle of bodies i may wrongly take another s visibly
broken arm to be my own mistakenly judging “i have a broken arm”

 upon
seeing a broken arm then it can make sense to wonder whether or not it
is mine

 if however i feel a pain in the arm and on that basis judge
“i have a pain” then it makes no sense at all for me to wonder whether
the pain of which i am aware is mine

 that is it is not possible for me
to be aware in the ordinary way of a pain in an arm but mistakenly
judge it to be my own arm that hurts

 on this picture selfascriptions
of pain at least when based on the usual introspective grounds involve
the use of “i” as subject and so are immune to this sort of error of
misidentification



immunity to this sort of error should not be conflated with another sort
of epistemic security that is often discussed under the heading of
selfknowledge see entry on selfknowledge

 some philosophers have
held that for a range of mental states one cannot be mistaken about
whether one is in them

 thus for example if one sincerely judges that
one has a pain or that one believes that p then it cannot turn out
that one is not in pain or that one does not so believe

 that the kind
of immunity to error described by wittgenstein differs from this sort of
epistemic security follows from the fact that one may be sceptical of
the latter while accepting the former

 that is one may reject the claim
that sincere judgements that one has a pain cannot be mistaken perhaps
it is possible to mistake a sensation of coldness for one of pain
whilst nevertheless maintaining that if one is introspectively aware of
a pain then that pain must be one s own

 immunity to errors of this
sort has been taken by a number of philosophers to be importantly
connected to selfconsciousness



under the influence of shoemaker 1968 this phenomenon has become known
as immunity to error through misidentification relative to the
firstperson pronoun or iem

 on shoemaker s formulation an error of
misidentification occurs when one knows some particular thing a to be
f and judges that b is f on the grounds that one mistakenly believes
that a is identical to b

 to this it is important to add that iem is not
a feature that judgements possess in virtue of their content alone but
only relative to certain grounds perception testimony introspection
memory etc



 thus the judgement that i am jealous of a might be iem
when grounded in introspection but not when grounded in the overheard
testimony of my analyst

 for i may have misinterpreted my analyst s
words wrongly taking his use of “smith” in “smith is jealous of a” to
refer to me “smith” after all is a common name

 iem is always
relative then to the grounds on which a judgement is based

 which
grounds might give rise to firstperson judgements that are iem is a
contested matter see the supplement the scope of immunity to error
through misidentification



on this account firstperson thoughts will be iem relative to certain
grounds just in case errors of misidentification are not possible with
respect to them

 that is they will be iem relative to grounds g if and
only if it is not possible that one knows via g some particular thing
a to be f and judges oneself to be f in virtue of mistakenly believing
that a is identical to oneself

 whilst precise formulations differ in
various ways this can reasonably be thought of as the standard account
of iem see for example shoemaker 1968 1970 1986 2012 brewer 1995
bermúdez 1998 §1

2 peacocke 1999 ch

coliva 2006 recanati 2007 part 6 perry 2012 most of the papers in
prosser recanati 2012 musholt 2015 ch

 1



an alternative way of formulating iem can be found in the work of
variety of philosophers

 on this view a judgement “a is f” is iem if
and only if it is not possible to undercut one s evidence for judging
that a is f without thereby undercutting one s evidence that someone is
f for variations on this idea see hamilton 1995 wright 1998 pryor
1999 campbell 1999a 2002 ch

 5 for discussion see coliva 2006 smith
2006a mcglynn 2016 and 2021

 as wright puts it a claim

 made on a certain kind of ground involves immunity to error through
 misidentification just when its defeat is not consistent with
 retention of grounds for existential generalization

 1998 19

the idea is that for a wide range of judgements it is possible that one
knows that something is f but wrongly supposes that a is f

 that is one
has misidentified which thing is f

 for other judgements perhaps
including the introspection based judgement that one has a headache
this sort of identification error is not possible

 after pryor s 1999
influential discussion this is typically known as immunity to
whichmisidentification or whiem



that whiem is a distinct phenomenon from iem as it is standardly
formulated is shown by the fact one may consistently claim that a form
of experience for example memory does not put one in a position to
think of some a distinct from oneself that a was f yet nevertheless
does put one in a position to think that someone was f

 that is it
might give rise to judgements that are iem but not whiem

 the converse
however is not possible

 for since “a was f” entails “someone was f”
it will not be possible for a judgement relative to some grounds to be
whiem without it also being iem

 if a judgement is based on an
identification it will be subject to errors of whmisidentification


for this reason whiem might legitimately be considered the more
fundamental notion as it is by pryor 1999



what is the philosophical significance of iem

 first consider what it
would take for a form of experience to ground thoughts that are iem


suppose that a form of experience introspection for example itself has
firstpersonal content

 that is suppose that the content of
introspective awareness is not adequately conceptualised as pain but
rather requires the firstpersonal form my pain

 if so then there
would be no need for an identification of some object as oneself for
the identity of the subject of pain is already given as oneself

 on this
way of thinking to determine which forms of experience ground
judgements that are iem would be to determine which forms of experience
have firstpersonal content

 and that according to some philosophers
is to determine which forms of experience are themselves forms of
selfconsciousness see for example bermúdez 1998 144

 this issue is
further discussed in §3



second wittgenstein suggests that the phenomenon of iem is responsible
for the in his view mistaken opinion that the use of “i” as subject
refers to an immaterial soul 1958 66

 this is for the reason that one
may be tempted to suppose that if introspectively based selfascriptions
of psychological predicates do not rely on an identification of a bodily
entity they must rely on the identification of a nonbodily entity
1958 70 for related discussion see peacocke 1999 ch

 6 coliva
2012

 wittgenstein s view of course is that they rely on no
identification at all

 as evans puts it they are identificationfree


essentially the same point is made by strawson in his diagnosis of “the
fact that lies at the root of the cartesian illusion” which is that
“criterionless” selfascription gives rise to the idea of a “purely
inner and yet subjectreferring use for i ” p

 f

 strawson 1966
164–166

 in short the fact that a certain class of firstperson
thoughts depend for their reference on no identification of myself as
some publicly presented object they are identificationfree gives rise
to the idea that they pick out a private object a soul

 there is a
clear connection between this idea and anscombe s 1975 argument for
the nonreferential character of “i”

 selfconsciousness in experience

some philosophers maintain that in addition to its manifestation in
firstpersonal thinking selfconsciousness is also present in various
forms of sensory and nonsensory experience bermúdez 1998 hurley 1998
ch

 4 zahavi 2005 peacocke 2014 musholt 2015

 after all
selfconsciousness is presumably a form of consciousness see entry on
consciousness

 on the view that experience like thought has
representational content this can be understood as the view that
experiences like thoughts can have content that is firstpersonal

 on
the further view that the content of experience is nonconceptual see
the entry on nonconceptual mental content the claim is that there is
nonconceptual firstperson content for a conceptualist response see
noë 2002

 bermúdez also argues that there is a nonconceptual form of
selfconscious thinking that arises from nonconceptual selfconscious
experience which he calls “protobelief” bermúdez 1998 ch

 5 cf


bermúdez 2003



the claim that there is a form of selfconsciousness in experience one
which arguably grounds the capacity to entertain firstpersonal thought
can be understood in a number of ways

 according to one view there is a
perceptual or quasiperceptual consciousness of the self as an object
of experience

 on another there is a “prereflective” form of
selfconsciousness that does not involve the awareness of the self as an
object

 a third claims that various forms of experience involve a
distinctive “sense of ownership” in which each of us is aware of our own
states as our own

 in each case the question is whether the mode of
experience in question can in peacocke s 2014 ch

 4 words act as
the “nonconceptual parent” of the firstperson concept and associated
phenomena in particular that of immunity to error through
misidentification



3

1 consciousness of the self

it is natural to suppose that selfconsciousness is fundamentally a
conscious awareness of the self

 on such a view one is selfconscious
if when one introspects one is aware of a thing that is in some
sense presented as oneself

 this is the view mentioned in §1

2 that
hume seems to be rejecting with his claim that when he introspects he
can never catch himself but only perceptions hume 1739–40 bk

 1 ch


4 §6

 whilst hume s claim has been very influential it has not found
universal acceptance

 those siding with hume include shoemaker 1986
martin 1997 howell 2010 2023 ch

3 and prinz 2012 for a
related jamesian perspective see flanagan 1992 ch

 9

 those opposing
him include chisholm 1976 ch

 1 cassam 1995 g

 strawson 2009
damasio 2010 and rosenthal 2012



as with firstperson thought the issue is not whether one is or can
be conscious of what is in fact oneself

 if that were sufficient for
selfconsciousness then on the supposition that one is identical to
one s body seeing oneself in a mirror would be a case of
selfconsciousness even if one were unaware that it was oneself that
one saw

 rather the issue is whether one is or can be conscious of
oneself as oneself a form of awareness in which it is manifest to one
that the object of awareness is oneself

 if there is such an awareness
then this is philosophically significant since one might expect it to
ground certain cases of selfknowledge firstperson reference and the
immunity to error of certain firstperson thoughts shoemaker 1986 see
the entry on selfknowledge

 the inner consciousness of the self as f
for example would account for one s capacity to refer to oneself as
oneself one s knowledge that one is f and the fact that such a thought
cannot rest on a misidentification of another thing as oneself

 on the
other hand the claim that there is no such conscious awareness of the
self is philosophically significant not only because it undermines the
possibility of such explanations but also for the reason that it plays
an important role in various well known arguments for example in
kant s first critique 17811787 most obviously the transcendental
deduction the refutation of idealism and the paralogisms and in
wittgenstein s discussion of the conceptual problem of other minds
kripke 1982 postscript



a simple argument for the claim that we are introspectively aware of
ourselves is that in introspection one is perceptually aware of one s
own mental properties and that when one perceives a property one
perceives that which has that property i

e

 oneself

 shoemaker 1984b
1986 agrees that if there is an introspective awareness of the self as
an object then it should be understood as a form of selfperception

 he
argues however that on a plausible account of perception
introspection is not a form of perception so we do not introspectively
perceive anything including the self

 as such we cannot conclude in
this way that we are introspectively aware of the self cf

 martin 1997
rosenthal 2012



shoemaker further argues in a way reminiscent of the heidelberg school
frank 1995 musholt 2015 ch

 1 that the postulation of an
introspective awareness of the self as the self would not be in a
position to explain all selfknowledge

 according to shoemaker 1984b
105 if inner perception revealed an object to be f then i would only
be in a position to judge that i am f if i already took myself to be
that object that i perceive

 but this both presupposes some
nonperceptual selfknowledge i

e

 that i am the thing perceived via
inner sense and also implausibly opens up introspection based
firstperson thought to the possibility of errors of misidentification
since such a view would entail that introspective selfknowledge is
based in part on an identification of the self



a number of philosophers have maintained that even if hume is right
that introspection does not reveal the self as an object there is
another form of perceptual experience which does bodily awareness see
entry

 versions of this claim can be found in p

f

 strawson 1966
102 evans 1982 ch

 7 sutton morris 1982 ayers 1991 brewer
1995 cassam 1995 1997 bermúdez 1998 2011

 on this view
through bodily awareness i am aware of my body “from the inside” as a
bodily self as me

 brewer 1995 for example argues that since bodily
sensations are both manifestly properties of oneself and are perceived
as located properties of one s body it follows that in bodily awareness
one perceives one s body as oneself



if one s body is presented as oneself in bodily awareness then as
mentioned above we might expect this bodily selfperception to ground
firstperson thought about one s bodily states

 as pointed out in §2 it
is plausible that firstperson thoughts cannot fail to refer to their
thinker and further that this is manifest in the thinking of them


martin 1995 1997 argues on the basis of these two claims that if
bodily awareness is a form of selfawareness then one s body as
presented in bodily awareness must manifestly be oneself

 that is if a
form of awareness is to ground judgements which are manifestly about
myself then that form of awareness must manifestly be an awareness of
myself

 but this is arguably a condition that it does not meet since it
is perfectly coherent to wonder whether or not one is identical to one s
body just as descartes famously did in the meditations for a
different imaginationbased argument against bodily awareness as a
form of selfawareness see smith 2006b see bermúdez 2011 for a
response for discussions of the relation between selfconsciousness and
imagination see b

 williams 1973 reynolds 1989 velleman 1996



another way in which it can be argued that the self figures in sensory
experience is in the selflocating content of perceptual experience
most notably vision

 visual experience is perspectival containing
information not only about perceived objects but also of their spatial
relation to the perceiver i see the wall as in front of me the
bookcase as to my left and so on

 the bodily self it might be
argued is experienced as an object in the world the point of origin of
egocentric perception cassam 1997 52–53 hurley 1998 ch

 4 bermúdez
1998 ch

 5 2002 2011 peacocke 1999 ch

 6 schwenkler 2014

 on an
alternative view one consistent with the rejection of any sort of
awareness of the self as an object visual perception does not present
the self at its point of origin but rather represents the locations of
perceived objects in monadic terms as ahead to the left and so on
without specifying what it is that they are ahead or to the left of

2 prereflective selfconsciousness

if firstperson thought is not grounded in an awareness of the self as
an object then some other account is arguably required to account for
the capacity to entertain selfconscious thought o brien 1995a

 one
suggestion is that subjects possess a form of “prereflective
selfawareness” as a necessary condition of consciousness sartre 1937
1943 introduction zahavi 2005 2007 legrand 2006 cf

 kriegel 2009
borner frank williford 2019 howell 2023 ch

5

 for criticism see
schear 2009 also see the entry on phenomenological approaches to
selfconsciousness

 on this view all conscious experience involves an
implicit awareness of oneself as its subject without explicitly
representing the self as an object of awareness cf

 musholt s
distinction between “selfrepresentationalist” and
“nonselfrepresentationalist” accounts of nonconceptual
selfconsciousness 2015 chs

 3–4

 indeed it might be argued that
the necessity of an active agent s possessing some form of
selfawareness follows from the connection between action and
selfconsciousness that many suppose to have been established by
considerations of the essential indexical discussed in §2

1 cf


bermúdez 1998



these views are closely associated with theories that explain
consciousness in terms of selfconsciousness §4

3

 prereflective
selfawareness is “prereflective” according to its proponents in the
sense that it does not require one to explicitly reflect on one s own
mental states or to otherwise take them as objects of attention


rather prereflective selfawareness is manifest even in those
situations in which one s attention is directed outwards toward worldly
objects and events

 prereflective selfawareness then is implicit in
all consciousness providing one with a continuous awareness of oneself
as the subject of one s stream of experience



one way in which such views can be understood is as maintaining that
experience involves selfconsciousness in the mode rather than the
content of conscious experience recanati 2007 part 5 2012 o brien
2007 ch

 6

 this can be fleshed out by analogy with the case of
belief one might claim that the concept of truth figures in the mode
but not the explicit content of every belief

 that is whilst every
belief is a holding true it is not the case that every belief has the
content that such and such is true

 similarly whilst every experience
is an experience of one s own it is not the case that every experience
has the content that such and such is experienced by oneself

 rather
the mode of conscious experience introspection bodily awareness etc


includes an implicit awareness of the self

 a related view is that the
self can be considered an “unarticulated constituent” of the experience
just as some claim that “here” is an unarticulated constituent of “it is
raining” perry 1986 recanati 2007 parts 9 10 for scepticism about
unarticulated constituents see cappelen lepore 2007

 so just as the
person who believes “it is raining” is implicitly aware of the fact that
it is here that it is raining so the subject of selfconscious
experience is implicitly aware of the fact that it is she herself who is
undergoing that experience



accounts of selfconsciousness as involving unarticulated constituents
or as implicit in the mode of consciousness will need to explain how
the transition is made from such implicit selfawareness to the explicit
representation of the self in firstperson thought

 one option is to
appeal to the idea that certain sources of information are selftracking
or in perry s 2012 words “necessarily selfinformative”

 a form of
experience is selftracking if it is a way of coming to know of the
instantiation of properties of a certain type and necessarily a
subject can come to know in that way of the instantiation of her own
states only

 for example if it is true that a subject can only remember
conscious episodes from her own past then episodic memory is
selftracking

 if so then the subject may legitimately think the
firstperson thought “i was f” on the basis of her episodic memory of
being f

 this account may also be used to explain iem since if a form
of experience is selftracking then it will not be possible for me to
know in that way that a is f but mistakenly think that it is me that
is f on the grounds that i mistakenly believe myself to be identical to
a perry 2012 recanati 2012 cf

 campbell 1999a martin 1995

 here we
have an architectural feature of a given form of experience that it is
necessarily an awareness of oneself being employed in an explanation of
an epistemic feature of selfascriptions based on such experience that
they are not partly grounded in an identity judgement

 if i know in
the relevant way that a is f then it must be the case that i am a

 on
this view making a firstperson judgement grounded in a given form of
experience is a matter of articulating the unarticulated self

 the
experience itself is not explicitly firstpersonal representing the
self as oneself

 nevertheless it “concerns” the subject in that it is
necessarily tied to the self see musholt 2015 ch

account

3 the sense of ownership

prereflective or implicit accounts of the place of selfconsciousness
in experience are often associated with the socalled “sense of
ownership” or “sense of mineness” flanagan 1992 martin 1995 dokic
2003 marcel 2003 zahavi 2005 ch

 5 de vignemont 2007 2013 and 2018
tsakiris 2011 zahavi kriegel 2015 de vignemont and alsmith 2017
part ii garcíacarpintero and guillot 2023

 according to some a
fundamental aspect of conscious experiences is that they seem in each
case to be mine

 in being aware of a thought action emotion
perceptual experience memory bodily experience and also my body
itself i am aware of it as being my own

 this sense of ownership
arguably does some work in explaining why it seems difficult to conceive
of what it would be like to experience a thought as located in another s
mind or a pain as located in another s body martin 1995 dokic 2003


for such an experience would involve being aware of a thought that
seemed to be mine but as located in a mind that did not seem to be my
own

 the sense of ownership is also a candidate for explaining immunity
to error through misidentification since if conscious experiences seem
to be one s own then there is presumably no need for any identification
of the experience s subject as oneself



whilst the sense of ownership would presumably be accounted for by an
introspective awareness of the self it can also arguably be explained
with the more minimal commitments of the implicit view

 the sense of an
experience as my own can be understood as nothing over and above the
fact that the self is implicitly given in the mode of conscious
awareness musholt 2015 §4

2

 thus the focus on the sense of ownership
might be thought to provide a minimal answer to humean scepticism about
selfperception

 as chisholm points out for example although hume
complained that he could find no self in introspection he reported his
findings in firstpersonal terms

 that is he was aware not only of his
mental states but also aware of them as his own chisholm 1976 ch

 3 attack on the “noownership” view



even within the context of an implicit account of selfconsciousness in
experience we can further distinguish between reductive and
nonreductive construals of the sense of ownership bermúdez 2011
zahavi kriegel 2015 alsmith 2015

 for example zahavi and kriegel
2015 cf

 kriegel 2003 2009 zahavi 2014 defend a nonreductive
understanding of the sense of ownership as a distinct aspect of the
phenomenal character of experience

 by contrast a reductive account
will explain the sense of ownership in terms of cognitive andor
experiential states whose existence we are independently willing to
endorse

 for example bermúdez 2011 161–166 argues in favour of a
reductive account of the sense of ownership over one s own body
according to which it consists in nothing more than the phenomenology of
the spatial location of bodily sensations alongside our disposition to
judge the body in which they occur to be our own cf

 dainton 2008
§8

2 prinz 2012

 bermúdez s argument for the reductive view is in
part based on the claim that despite appearances the nonreductive
sense of ownership is not in fact able to explain firstpersonal
judgements of ownership cf

 schear 2009 for a response see zahavi 
kriegel 2015



it is sometimes claimed that the variety of ways in which
selfconsciousness can break down poses a challenge to the claim that
the sense of ownership is a universal characteristic of experience

 such subjects may disown
their experiences or attribute them to others

 for example in cases of
thought insertion a symptom of schizophrenia subjects report that they
are aware of the thoughts of other people or objects entering their own
minds see for example saks 2007 ch

 2 for general discussion of
schizophrenia and selfconsciousness see parnas sass 2011

 on the
assumption that such subjects are actually aware of what are in fact
their own thoughts this might seem to be a case of a conscious
experience that lacks the sense of ownership

 thus either the sense of
ownership is not a necessary feature of experience or perhaps there is
no sense of ownership at all see for example chadha 2017 for some
reasons to be generally sceptical towards the sense of ownership see
mclelland 2023



a common response to this line of thought involves first
distinguishing between the sense of ownership and the sense of agency
and second claiming that subjects of thought insertion lack the latter
whilst retaining the former stephens graham 2000 gallagher 2004
peacocke 2008 §7

8 proust 2013 ch

 12

 the sense of agency is the
awareness of being the source or the agent of some action or activity
including mental agency

 it is the sense that it is me that is thinking
a given thought bayne 2008 o brien soteriou 2009 proust 2013 ch


10

 according to this standard view cases of thought insertion or
anarchic hand for example can be wholly explained by postulating a
lack of a sense of agency

 the usual sense of being the agent of a
thought is lacking but the sense of ownership remains since the thought
seems to the subject be taking place in their own mind



we might however wish to make a threeway distinction between the
sense of agency the sense that one is the author of a mental state
the sense of ownership the sense that one is the owner of a mental
state and what we might call the sense of location the sense that a
mental state is located within one s own mind

 the sense of location
might be understood as being possessed if one is aware of a mental state
in the ordinary way i

e

 introspectively

 crucial it would seem for
evaluating the significance of thought insertion and related cases and
so of the standard view will be determining which if any of the
senses of agency ownership or location remain intact

 for it might be
argued that what such subjects retain is in fact the sense of location
rather than the sense of ownership

 that is it may be possible to take
their descriptions at face value when they deny in thought insertion
for example that the thoughts in question are their own or were
thought by them whilst nevertheless accepting that the inserted
thought occurs within the boundary of their own mind for criticisms of
the standard view see bortolotti broome 2009 pacherie martin 2013

 the conditions of selfconsciousness

much of the philosophical work on selfconsciousness concerns its
relation to a variety of other phenomena

 these include the nature of
personhood rationality consciousness and the awareness of other
minds

 in each case we can ask whether selfconsciousness is a necessary
andor sufficient condition for the phenomenon in question



4

1 selfconsciousness and personhood

as was mentioned in §1

2 locke characterises a person as “a thinking
intelligent being that has reason and reflection and can consider it
self as it self the same thinking thing in different times and places”
1700 ii

xxvii

9

 on such a view selfconsciousness is essential to
personhood

 in particular on locke s view it is the capacity to
reidentify oneself at different times that is important a claim which
is in keeping with the central role of memory in his account of personal
identity see ayers 1991 vol

 ii chs

 22–25 thiel 2011 ch

 4
weinberg 2011 g

 strawson 2011b snowdon 2014 ch

 3 entry on personal
identity

 as such locke considers the capacity for selfconscious
thinking to be a necessary condition of personhood

 what is less clear
is whether on this view selfconsciousness is sufficient for
personhood

 one reason for doubt on this score is that since it is
concerned with selfconscious thought the account provides no reason to
suppose that creatures that enjoy nonconceptual selfconsciousness are
persons

 a second is that the requirement of being able to reidentify
oneself over time is not one that we need consider met by all
selfconscious creatures for we can suppose it is possible for a
selfconscious subject to lack the conceptual sophistication to
understand the past and future tense



an alternative conception of personhood that also gives a central role
to selfconsciousness can be found in frankfurt s claim that it is
essential to persons to have a capacity for reflective selfevaluation
manifested in the possession of what he calls “secondorder volitions”
frankfurt 1971 110

 secondorder volitions involve wanting a certain
desire to be one s will that is wanting it to move one to action

 a
subject with secondorder volitions has the capacity to evaluate their
firstorder desires and this it would seem involves being aware of
them as potentially their own

 thus persons thought of as subjects
with secondorder volitions are selfconscious for discussion see
watson 1975 dennett 1976 frankfurt 1987 bratman 2007 chs

 5 11



an account of persons that would appear to distance that notion from
selfconsciousness is that offered by p

f

 strawson in chapter 3 of
individuals

 the concept of a person is the concept of a type of entity such that
 both predicates ascribing states of consciousness and predicates
 ascribing corporeal characteristics a physical situation c

 are
 equally applicable to a single individual of that type

 1959
 101–102 for discussion see ayer 1963 hacker 2002

frankfurt points out that this is inadequate as a definition of
personhood since “there are many entities beside persons that have both
mental and physical properties” frankfurt 1971 5

 it may be however
that strawson s formulation here is somewhat loose and that his central
idea is that persons are those entities that self­ascribe both types of
predicate a condition that perhaps rules out at least most nonhuman
animals

 after all chapter 3 of individuals entitled “persons” is
primarily concerned with the conditions of such selfascription with
“the use we make of the word i ” p

f

 strawson 1959 94



strawson s primary goal is to argue for the claim that the concept of a
person is primitive a position that he contrasts on the one hand with
cartesian dualism and on the other with what he calls the
“noownership view” a view according to which we don t really
selfascribe states of consciousness at all at least not with the use
of “i” as subject cf

 wittgenstein 1953 §244 1958 76 anscombe 1975
it is controversial whether wittgenstein ever really held this view for
discussion see hacker 1990 chs

 5 11 jacobsen 1996 wright 1998

 to
say that the concept of a person is primitive is on strawson s account
to say that it is “logically prior” to the concepts subject and body
persons are not to be thought of as compounds of subjects and bodies


strawson argues that the primitiveness of the concept of a person is a
necessary condition of the possibility of selfconsciousness p

f


strawson 1959 98–103

 his argument is that one can only selfascribe
states of consciousness if one is able to ascribe them to others for
more on this theme see §4

4

 this rules out cartesian dualism since
ascribing states of consciousness to others requires that one be able to
identify others and one cannot identify pure subjects of experience or
cartesian egos

 the condition that one must be able to ascribe states of
consciousness to others also rules out the “noownership view” because
such a view is inconsistent with the fact that psychological predicates
have the very same sense in their first and third person uses



closely related to the noownership view are a family of claims about
persons that parfit dubs “reductionism” parfit 1984 §79

 two
prominent members of this family are the claim that

 a person s existence consists in the existence of a brain and body
 and the occurrence of a series of interrelated physical and mental
 event 1984 211

and that

 though persons exist we could give a complete description of
 reality without claiming that persons exist

 1984 212

parfit s reductionism and its relation to buddhist views of the self
has been widely discussed see for example stone 1988 korsgaard 1989
cassam 1989 1993 1997 ch

 5 garrett 1991 1998 ch

 2 siderits
1997 mcdowell 1997 blackburn 1997 lee 2017 defends a view closely
related to that of partfit

 as is the case with the “noownership view”
it has sometimes been argued that reductionism is incompatible with
selfconsciousness so since we are indisputably selfconscious
reductionism must be false

 against the claim that the continued
existence of a person consists merely in the continued existence of
brain body and interrelated physical and mental events that do not
presuppose anything about persons as such mcdowell 1997 for example
argues from a broadly evansian position on selfconsciousness see the
supplement evans on first person thought that there simply are no such
“identityfree relations” 1997 378 to which a person s identity could
be reducible

 that is there is no way of characterising memory and the
other psychological phenomena relevant to personal identity without
invoking the identity of the person whose memory it is

 as mcdowell puts
it

 in continuity of “consciousness” there is what appears to be
 knowledge of an identity the persistence of the same subject through
 time

 1997 361

memory at least cannot be employed in a reductive account of persons
for discussion of mcdowell s argument see buford 2009 fernández 2014

reductionism see cassam 1997 ch

2 selfconsciousness and rationality

is selfconsciousness a necessary condition of rationality

 a number of
philosophers have argued that rationality requires selfknowledge which
itself implies selfconsciousness see shoemaker 1988 1994 burge 1996
moran 2001 bilgrami 2006 boyle 2009 2011 for a general discussion of
this approach to selfknowledge see gertler 2011 ch

 6

 in his case
against perceptual theories of selfknowledge shoemaker 1994 argues
against the possibility of selfblindness against that it is the
possibility that a rational creature with all the necessary concepts
might be simply unaware of its own sensations beliefs and so on

 a
rational creature that is in pain shoemaker argues will typically
desire to be rid of her pain and this requires that she believe that
she is in pain

 as shoemaker puts it to see rational responses to pain

 as pain behavior is to see them as motivated by such states of the
 creature as the belief that it is in pain the desire to be rid of the
 pain and the belief that such and such a course of behaviour will
 achieve that result

 shoemaker 1994 228

this belief that she is in pain is a selfconscious one it is a
belief that she herself is in pain

 this connection between rational
behaviour and firstperson thought is of course the one highlighted by
perry s 1979 case of the messy shopper in his discussion of the
essential indexical see §2

1



the connection between rationality and selfknowledge and so
selfconsciousness shoemaker argues is even more pronounced in the
case of our awareness of our own beliefs

 rational subjects should abide
by certain strictures on the contents of their beliefs updating them in
line with new evidence removing inconsistencies and so on

 and this
shoemaker argues requires that they not be selfblind with respect to
their beliefs

 it requires that they are selfconscious

 as shoemaker
writes

 in an important class of cases the rational revision or adjustment of
 the beliefdesire system requires that we undertake investigations
 aimed at determining what revisions or readjustments to make what
 rationalizes the investigation are one s higherorder beliefs about
 what one believes and has reason to believe

 shoemaker 1994 240
 also see shoemaker s discussion of moore s paradox in shoemaker 1988
 1994 for critical discussion of shoemaker s arguments in the context
 of theories of selfknowledge see for example macdonald 1999 kind
 2003 siewert 2003 gertler 2011 ch

 5

the connection that shoemaker sees between the requirements of
rationality on the one hand and selfawareness on the other is also
stressed in socalled “rationalist” accounts of selfknowledge most
prominently in the work of burge 1996 and moran 2001 for critical
discussion of the rationalist approach as an account of selfknowledge
see for example peacocke 1996 o brien 2003 reed 2010 gertler 2011
ch

 6

 burge focuses on the notion of the critical reasoner

 he writes

 to be capable of critical reasoning and to be subject to certain
 rational norms necessarily associated with such reasoning some mental
 acts and states must be knowledgeably reviewable

 burge 1996 97 for
 a fuller argument for the same conclusion see burge 1998

on burge s account the critical reasoner must be in a position to
recognise their reasons as reasons and that requires “the second order
ability to think about thought contents or propositions and rational
relations among them” 1996 97

 this is for the reason that belief
involves commitments and such commitments involve meeting certain
standards—providing reasons reevaluating where necessary and so on



a similar line of thought can be found in moran s account of the role of
reflection on one s own state in practical deliberation about what to do
and how to feel moran 2001 ch

 2

 here the focus is not so much on
critical reasoning but rather practical deliberation as that which
requires selfconsciousness

 this is an idea that is also central to
much of korsgaard s work see in particular korsgaard 1996 2009

 a
central concern of hers is to distinguish between the sort of action of
which all animals are capable and the sort of autonomous agency of which
we selfconscious subjects are capable

 the difference lies on her
broadly kantian view in simply having one s most powerful desire result
in action on the one hand and counting that desire as a reason for
action on the other

 it is the latter that is constitutive of
autonomous deliberative action understood from the perspective of
practical reason

 as she writes

 when you deliberate it is as if there were something over and above
 all your desires something which is you and which chooses which
 desire to act upon

 korsgaard 1996 100

selfconsciousness on this view

 is the source of reason

 when we become conscious of the workings of
 an incentive within us the incentive is experienced not as a force or
 a necessity but as a proposal something we need to make a decision
 about

 korsgaard 2009 119 for discussion of korsgaard s account of
 the relation between selfconsciousness and the perspective of
 practical reason see for example nagel 1996 fitzpatrick 2005
 soteriou 2013 ch

 12



selfawareness on these views is a necessary condition of rationality
conceived as the capacity for critical reasoning or practical
deliberation

 burge also makes it clear that he regards the capacity
for critical reasoning to be a necessary condition of conceptual
selfconsciousness since to master and selfascribe psychological
concepts such as belief one must be able to recognise their role in
reasoning and so employ them burge 1996 97 n

3

 as he puts it

 acknowledging with the i concept that an attitude or act is one s
 own is acknowledging that rational evaluations of it which one also
 acknowledges provide immediate reason and rationally immediate
 motivation to shape the attitude or act in accordance with the
 evaluation the firstperson concept fixes the locus of
 responsibility

 burge 1998 253

the claim that there is a constitutive connection between
selfconsciousness and rationality has been met with scepticism by
kornblith 2011 2012 ch

 2 for a related line of thought see doris
2015 ch

 2

 regarding the sort of responsiveness to reason involved in
updating one s beliefs in accordance with new evidence—one of the
capacities emphasised by both shoemaker and burge—kornblith argues that
“while such responsiveness may be achieved at times by way of
reflection on one s beliefs and desires it does not require any such
reflection” 2012 49

 rationally revising beliefs in the face of
evidence kornblith is keen to point out is a capacity enjoyed by
nonreflective animals

 he further presents the rationalist view with a
challenge if one thinks that firstorder beliefs are not themselves
responsive to reason how does adding secondorder beliefs help

 one
response to this challenge is to point out that the connection between
selfawareness and rationality that shoemaker finds is intended to hold
only for “an important class of cases” shoemaker 1994 240 that is it
holds for those cases of belief revision that themselves qualify as
exercises in rational investigation

 on this view whilst nonreflective
creatures may have some degree of rationality their lack of
selfconsciousness means that they are not as we are capable of fully
rational deliberation for discussion of kornblith s scepticism
concerning the role of selfconsciousness in rationality see pust 2014

 williams 2015 smithies 2016

3 selfconsciousness and consciousness

central to the history of the selfconsciousness sketched in §1 is a
concern with the relation between selfconsciousness and consciousness


since selfconsciousness is itself a form of consciousness
consciousness is of course a necessary condition of it

 but is
selfconsciousness necessary for consciousness

 positive answers to this
question come in both reductive and nonreductive varieties



one way in which consciousness might entail selfconsciousness is if the
former is reducible to the latter

 one such family of views are higher
order theories of consciousness which maintain that a psychological
state is conscious if and only if it is represented in the right way
by a higher order state gennaro 2004 for a very different account that
nevertheless posits a tight connection between consciousness and
selfconsciousness see o shaughnessy 2002 ch

 3

 a natural assumption
is that this higher order state is distinct from that which it
represents

 higher order theories that accept this assumption fall into
two camps higher order thought hot theories rosenthal 1986 2005
carruthers 2000 2005 which maintain that the higher order state is a
thought or belief and higher order perception hop theories armstrong
1968 lycan 1996 2004 which by contrast maintain that the higher
order state is a perceptionlike sensory state—an exercise of the sort
of inner perception or “inner sense” that was extensively debated
throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries thiel 2011 see
§3

1

 since however we can be aware that someone else is in some
conscious state it seems that simply being aware that a thought is
occurring is insufficient to render that thought conscious

 arguably
what is required is that one be aware that one is in the relevant
firstorder state

 that is one represents oneself as being in the state
in question

 since this seems to involve a form of selfawareness the
hot and hop theories can be understood as holding that consciousness
entails selfconsciousness gennaro 1996

 given this it is natural to
think of the distinction between hot and hop theories of consciousness
as closely related to that between conceptual and nonconceptual
selfconsciousness



an alternative to hot and hop theories that still maintains the ambition
to reduce consciousness to selfconsciousness is the
selfrepresentational view kriegel williford 2006 kriegel 2009
caston 2002 according to which a psychological state is conscious if
and only if it represents itself

 such accounts are higherorder views
that deny that the first and secondorder states are distinct

 as with
both hot and hop selfrepresentationalism can be thought of as
supporting the view that a form of selfconsciousness is a necessary
condition of consciousness

 kriegel 2003 dubs this “intransitive
selfconsciousness” the phenomenon purportedly picked out by phrases of
the form “i am selfconsciously thinking that p” and distinguishes it
from the “transitive selfconsciousness” purportedly picked out by
phrases of the form “i am selfconscious of my thought that p”

 this is
a version of the distinction between reflective and prereflective
selfconsciousness discussed in §3

2 and the views of fichte and sartre
mentioned in §1 cf

 kapitan 1999

 if conscious states are those that
represent themselves then it might be argued consciousness entails
intransitive selfconsciousness since one s conscious states do not
only represent themselves but also in some way implicitly represent
oneself as having them kriegel 2003 104



aristotle considering a version of the hop theory argued that the view
suffered from a regress problem since the higherorder perception must
itself be conscious and so be accompanied by a hop which would itself
be conscious and so on de anima 3

2 caston 2002

 the standard way to
diffuse such a worry is to deny that the higher order state be it
perception or thought need be conscious

 an alternative of course is
to endorse a selfrepresentational account

 there are other objections
to higher order views however each of which applies to one or more
versions of the view

 they include worries about the possibility of
objectless and nonveridical higher order states byrne 1997 block
2011 worries about whether it can account for the conscious states of
infants and nonhumans dretske 1995 ch

 4 tye 1995 ch

 1 the
complaint that the postulation of a distinct higherorder state for
every conscious state leads to an unnecessarily “cluttered picture of
the mind” chalmers 1996 231 and the fundamental worry that no form
of higherorder view has the resources to explain consciousness at all
levine 2006 cf

 kriegel 2012

 as such higherorder and
selfrepresentational theories of consciousness that posit a necessary
connection between consciousness and selfconsciousness are far from
being established



if consciousness cannot be reduced to selfconsciousness perhaps the
latter is nevertheless a necessary condition of the former

 some
nonreductive views already mentioned see prereflective consciousness
see §3

2 or the sense of ownership see §3

3 as necessary conditions
of consciousness see zahavi 2005

 a different nonreductive and
broadly kantian argument for the claim that selfconsciousness is a
necessary condition of consciousness first of all claims that conscious
experience is necessarily unified and second that this unity of
consciousness in turn depends on selfawareness

 of primary interest
here is the second step which is articulated by strawson in his
discussion of kant s transcendental deduction as the claim that

 if different experiences are to belong to a single consciousness
 there must be the possibility of self­consciousness on the part of the
 subject of those experiences

 p

f

 strawson 1966 93 for discussion
 of kant s views of the matter see henrich 1989 powell 1990 brook
 1994 keller 1998 kitcher 2011 allison 2015 for detailed discussion
 of whether consciousness is necessarily unified see bayne 2010 see
 also entry on unity of consciousness



one reason for supposing that there is a connection between
selfconsciousness and the unity of consciousness is given by kant who
writes

 only because i can comprehend their manifold in a consciousness do i
 call them altogether my representations for otherwise i would have as
 multicoloured diverse a self as i have representations of which i am
 conscious

 kant 17811787 b134

that is a single self must be able to “comprehend” its own experiences
together otherwise they would not really be its own

 such
“comprehension” would seem to involve selfconsciousness

 as kant
famously puts it

 the i think must be able to accompany all my representations for
 otherwise something would be represented in me that could not be
 thought at all which is as much as to say that the representation
 would either be impossible or else at least would be nothing for me


 kant 17811787 b131–132

on this view it is the unity of the self that guarantees that
coconscious experiences are jointly selfascribable that unity
requires selfconsciousness there is a question as to whether
selfconsciousness is here supposed to explain the unity of
consciousness cf

 dainton s strong and weak “ithesis” 2000 §2

3


this kantian picture is associated with the claim that unified
selfconsciousness requires a conception of the world as objective as
transcending the perspective that one has on it

 the idea here is that
to selfascribe an experience one must have some grasp of the
distinction between one s subjective experience that the objective
condition of which it is an experience these issues are explored in
p

f

 strawson 1966 bennett 1966 evans 1980 cassam 1997 sacks 2000
also see burge 2010 ch

 6 gomes 2016 and 2024



the claim that the unity of consciousness requires selfconsciousness
can be criticised in a number of different ways

 how one evaluates the
claim will depend on whether one has conceptual or nonconceptual
selfconsciousness in mind

 as bayne 2004 points out the claim that
the unity of consciousness requires that one possess the concept of
oneself seems implausibly to imply that conceptually unsophisticated
infants and nonhuman animals could not possess a unified stream of
consciousness of course this worry applies quite generally to views
that connect consciousness with selfconsciousness

 the view that
nonconceptual selfconsciousness is a necessary condition of the unity
of consciousness would appear to be vulnerable to the objection that it
implausibly rules out the possibility of cases such as anscombe s 1975
subject in a sensory deprivation tank a case in which the forms of
experience typically classed as forms of nonconceptual
selfconsciousness are lacking for related cases see bayne 2004 also
see g

 strawson 1999

 a different worry about the connection between
selfconsciousness and the unity of consciousness is the “just more
content” objection b

 williams 1978 ch

 3 hurley 1994 and 1998 part
i

 the concern is addressed to the view that selfconsciousness is not
merely a necessary condition of the unity of consciousness but is that
in virtue of which it is unified

 for if the selfascription of
experiences is taken to be that which is responsible for the unity of
consciousness how can we account for the fact that the selfconscious
thoughts are themselves unified with the firstorder experiences that
they supposedly unify

 as hurley puts it

 selfconscious or firstperson contents are just more contents to
 which the problem of coconsciousness i

e

 the unity of
 consciousness also applies 1998 61

to appeal to the thirdorder selfascription of the selfconscious
thought would appear to invite a regress

4 selfconsciousness and intersubjectivity

what is the connection between selfconsciousness and the awareness of
others

 on some views selfconsciousness requires awareness of others
on another view the awareness of others requires selfconsciousness

 in
each case we can distinguish between those accounts according to which
such awareness is merely an empirical condition from those according to
which it is a strictly necessarysufficient condition

 there is also a
distinction to be made regarding the sense of “awareness of others” that
is in play whilst some philosophers are concerned with knowledge of
other minds others are content with the representation of others
veridical or not



a familiar account of our knowledge of others takes the form of an
argument from analogy slote 1970 ch

 4 avramides 2001 part i

 the
argument from analogy presents an account of our justification for
moving from judgements about others observable behaviour to judgements
about their unobservable mental states

 i am aware from my own case
that say wincing is the result of pain so on seeing another s
wincing i am justified in judging them to be in pain

 on this picture
selfawareness as manifest in the judgement about my own case is a
necessary condition of knowledge of other minds

 in this respect the
view is related to contemporary simulation theory standard versions of
which see our capacity to attribute mental states to others as dependent
on our capacity to attribute them to ourselves heal 1986 goldman 2006
ch

 9 for a simulationist theory that differs in this respect see
gordon 1996

 associated with the argument from analogy is a view
according to which our grasp of mental state concepts is an essentially
firstpersonal affair

 that is we understand what for example pain is
first from our own case nagel 1986 §2

3 peacocke 2008 ch

 5–6 it
has sometimes been claimed that this view gives rise to the conceptual
problem of other minds see wittgenstein 1958 §302 mcginn 1984
avramides 2001 part ii



in opposition to this package stand views on which our grasp and
application of mental state concepts is neutral between the first and
thirdperson cases

 theory theorists for example claim that we
attribute mental states to both ourselves and others by means of a
tacitly held psychological theory

 they may also hold that possession
of such a theory constitutes our grasp of mental state concepts
carruthers 1996 2011 ch

 8 gopnik meltzoff 1997 for an account
that combines elements of theory with elements of simulation see
nichols stich 2003

 while such views accord no priority to the
firstperson case they may see a tight connection between
selfconsciousness and our capacity to think about others these are
simply two aspects of the more general capacity to think about the mind


a distinct though related family of views see both selfconsciousness
and awareness of others as emerging from a primitive “adualist” state in
which self and other are not distinguished piaget 1937 merleauponty
1960 barresi moore 1996 hurley 2005 gallese 2005 also see d

 stern
1985 part ii

 against such “adualist” views it is often claimed the
phenomena of neonate imitation joint attention and emotion regulation
show that infants display an awareness of others as others from the very
beginning of life meltzoff moore 1977 trevarthen 1979 hurley 
chater 2005 eilan et al

 2005 legerstee 2005 reddy 2008

 one
empirical proposal is that it is from this early form of social
interaction and capacity to understand others that selfconsciousness
emerges as a selfdirected form of mindreading carruthers 2011
carruthers fletcher ritchie 2012 for an early such account see
mead 1934

 on such a view the firstperson case is treated as
secondary reversing the traditional picture associated with the
argument from analogy



a more ambitious version of this approach to the relationship between
selfconsciousness and awareness of others prioritizing the awareness
of others is to argue that knowledge of other minds is a necessary
condition of the possibility of selfconsciousness

 well known examples
of such arguments can be found in the work of p

f

 strawson 1959 ch


3 and davidson 1991 for the related hegelian view that various forms
of selfconsciousness depend on intersubjective recognition see honneth
1995 also sartre s 1943 part 3 ch

1 view that awareness of oneself
as an object is mediated by the look of the other

 since knowledge of
other minds is typically considered to be open to sceptical doubt and
selfconsciousness is not such lines of reasoning can be thought of as
transcendental arguments and so potentially open to general criticisms
of that form of argument stroud 1968 r

 stern 1999 2000 see the
entry on transcendental arguments

 strawson s argument hinges on his
claim that

 the idea of a predicate is correlative with that of a range of
 distinguishable individuals of which the predicate can be
 significantly though not necessarily truly affirmed

f

 strawson
 1959 99 cf

 evans generality constraint 1982 §4

this means strawson claims that one can only ascribe mental states to
oneself if one is capable of ascribing them to others which in turn
means that i cannot have gained the capacity to think of others mental
states by means of an analogical reasoning from my own case

 this
strawson argues shows that others observable behaviour is not a “sign”
of their mentality but is a “criterion” of it

 in short we must have
knowledge of others minds if we are selfconscious for the full
argument see p

davidson s transcendental argument—the triangulation argument—connects
selfconsciousness knowledge of other minds and knowledge of the
external world

 at its heart is the claim that for my thoughts to have
determinate content there must exist another subject who is able to
interpret me

 as davidson puts it

 it takes two points of view to give a location to the cause of a
 thought and thus to define its content until a base line has been
 established by communication with someone else there is no point in
 saying one s own thoughts or words have a propositional content


 davidson 1991 212–213

since selfconscious subjects are aware of the contents of their
thoughts they must know that there are other minds since the sort of
intersubjective externalism that davidson endorses guarantees it


selfknowledge on this view entails knowledge of others for
discussion see r

 selfconsciousness in infants and nonhuman animals

at what age can human infants be credited with selfconsciousness

 is
selfconsciousness present beyond homo sapiens

 some theorists for
example bermúdez 1998 claim that various forms of perceptual
experience constitute a nonconceptual form of selfconsciousness see
§3

 others for example rosenthal 2005 claim that phenomenal
consciousness entails selfconsciousness

 if either view is correct then
selfconsciousness of some kind can plausibly be attributed to
creatures other than adult humans

 but when it comes to more
sophisticated forms of selfawareness matters are less clear

 what is
required is some empirical criterion for judging a creature
selfconscious even if as with infants and nonhuman animals they are
unable to provide evidence via their use of the firstperson pronoun


such evidence if available may reasonably be thought to shed light on
both the phylogenetic and ontogenetic development of selfconsciousness
ferrari sternberg 1998 terrace metcalfe 2005 see the entries on
animal consciousness and animal cognition

1 mirror recognition

it has sometimes been claimed most forcefully by gallup and colleagues
that the capacity to recognise oneself in the mirror is a marker of
selfconsciousness gallup 1970 gallup anderson platek 2011
gallup platek spaulding 2014 gallup anderson 2020

 it is easy to
see why this might seem to be so since if firstperson thought involves
thinking about oneself as oneself then it is natural to suppose that a
capacity to recognise that a subject seen in a mirror is oneself
involves such a thought

 in evans s 1982 terminology such thoughts
involve an “identification component”



gallup 1970 devised a test for mirror selfrecognition
surreptitiously placing a red mark on a subject s forehead before
exposure to a mirror then observing whether they touch the relevant
spot

 it is well established that chimpanzees pass the mirror test while
other primate species fail anderson gallup 2011

 it has also been
claimed that dolphins and some elephants pass the test reiss marino
2001 plotnik et

 al

 2006

 with respect to human infants the
consensus is that success in the mirror test begins at around 15 to 18
months of age and that by 24 months most children pass amsterdam 1972
m

 lewis brooksgunn 1979 nielsen suddendorf slaughter 2006



it is not universally accepted however that success in the mirror test
is an indication of selfconsciousness

 for example heyes 1994
presents an influential critique of the claim that it is a marker of
selfawareness arguing that all that is required for success is that
subjects be able to distinguish between novel ways of receiving bodily
feedback in order to guide behaviour on the one hand and other forms
of incoming sensory data on the other

 such a view however needs to
explain why it is that passing the mirror test seems to be connected
with the phenomena arguably associated with selfconsciousness such as
experiencing shame and embarrassment m

 lewis 2011

 there remains
then significant controversy concerning what success in the mirror test
really shows and so whether it can shed light on the development of
selfawareness see for example mitchell 1993 suddendorf butler
2013 gallup platek spaulding 2014

 for related philosophical
discussion see rochat zahavi 2011 peacocke 2014 ch

2 episodic memory

another potential marker of selfconsciousness is episodic memory the
capacity that we have to recollect particular episodes from our own past
experience see tulving 1983 michaelian 2016 entry on memory

 as
tulving describes it episodic memory involves “autonoesis” or “mental
timetravel” the experience of transporting oneself in time which also
has a future oriented dimension in expectation planning and so on see
michaelian klein szpunar 2016

 the connection between memory and
selfconsciousness is one that is often made see §2

3 §3 and §4

1


if it is correct that episodic memory essentially involves a form of
selfconsciousness and we are able to test for the presence of episodic
memory in nonlinguistic infants and animals then we have a way of
detecting the presence of selfconscious abilities

 since however
episodic memory is not the only form of selfconsciousness the lack of
it does not indicate that a creature is not selfaware

 indeed the much
discussed case of k

c

 seems to be one in which due to an accident
someone has lost episodic memory but appears to remain otherwise
selfconscious see rosenbaum et

 al

 2005



tulving himself argues that only humans possess episodic memory and
only when they reach the age of around 4 years 2005 also see
suddendorf corballis 2007

 whilst human infants and nonhuman animals
possess nonepisodic forms of memory such as semantic memory
remembering that such and such is the case they lack the “autonoetic”
consciousness of themselves projected either back or forwards in time


for example whilst most 3 year old infants can remember presented
information most are unreliable when it comes to the question of how
they know—did they see it hear it etc

 gopnik graf 1988

 the
suggestion here is that the development of the reliable capacity to
report how they know some fact reflects the development of the capacity
to episodically remember the learning event



in the case of animals perhaps the most suggestive evidence of episodic
memory derives from work on scrubjays who can retain information about
what food has been stored where it was stored and when clayton
bussey dickinson 2003

 this evidence coheres with the “what where
when” criterion of episodic memory originally proposed by tulving
1972

 it is however widely accepted that this contentbased account
of episodic memory—episodic memory is memory that contains information
about what happened where it happened and when—is inadequate since
nonepisodic semantic memory often involves the retention of “what
where when” information

 due to the difficulties in finding a
behavioural test for “autonoetic” consciousness it is often though not
universally claimed that there is no compelling evidence for episodic
memory and thus this particular form of selfconsciousness in
nonhuman animals tulving 2005 suddendorf corballis 2007 michaelian
2016 ch

 2 for discussion relating to apes see menzel 2005 schwartz
2005 for an alternative perspective suggesting that episodic memory
abilities come in degree see breeden et

 al

 2016

3 metacognition

another body of research pertaining to the question of
selfconsciousness in infants and nonhuman animals is the work on
metacognition and metamemory

 the term “metacognition” typically
refers to the capacity to monitor and control one s own cognitive
states and is manifest in one s judgements or feelings concerning
one s own learning and consequent level of certainty or confidence j

d


smith 2009 beran et al

 2012 proust 2013 fleming frith 2014

 the
suggestion is that if a creature is able to monitor their own level of
confidence they are to that extent selfconscious

 one common paradigm
for testing metacognitive abilities involves presenting subjects with a
stimulus that they must categorise in one of two ways

 crucially they
are also given the opportunity to opt out of the test with correct
categorisation resulting in the highest reward opting out resulting in
a lower reward and incorrect categorisation resulting in no reward

 the
assumption is that the optout response reflects a metacognitive
judgement of uncertainty

 evidence gathered from such a paradigm has
been taken to show metacognitive abilities in some birds fujita et

 al


2012 dolphins j

d

 smith et

 al

 1995 primates shields et

 al


1997 and children from the age of around 4 years sodian et

 al


2012



the view that success on metacognitive optout tests is indicative of
selfconsciousness is not uncontroversial however

 for example it has
been suggested that the uncertainty response is indicative not of
metacognitive uncertainty monitoring but rather of firstorder
environmental judgements concerning a third category between the
intended two kornell son terrace 2007 hampton 2009 also see
carruthers 2008 kornell 2014 musholt 2015 ch

 7

 on such an
interpretation the research on metacognition does not provide
compelling evidence regarding selfconsciousness in infants and
nonhuman animals but for critical discussion see j

d

 smith 2005 j

d


smith couchman beran 2014 also relevant is the distinction between
“evaluativist” and “attributivist” accounts of metacognition outlined by
proust 2013

 the question of the significance of optout tests for
attributions of selfconsciousness remains controversial
