   false consciousness, in philosophy, particularly within critical theory
   and other Marxist schools and movements, the notion that members of the
   proletariat unwittingly misperceive their real position in society and
   systematically misunderstand their genuine interests within the social
   relations of production under capitalism. False consciousness denotes
   people’s inability to recognize inequality, oppression, and
   exploitation in a capitalist society because of the prevalence within
   it of views that naturalize and legitimize the existence of social
   classes.

   Despite its close assocation with Marxism, the term false consciousness
   was never used by Karl Marx. The first treatment of false consciousness
   as a theoretical concept occurred in History and Class Consciousness
   (1923) by the Hungarian philosopher and literary critic György Lukács.
   The concept was further developed in the 20th century by Marxist
   scholars such as the German-born American philosopher Herbert Marcuse
   and the French sociologist Henri Lefebvre. Since the late 20th century
   the concept has been utilized outside explicitly Marxist theorizing in
   studies of oppression on the basis of gender, sexual orientation,
   ethnicity, and race. See also ideology: Hegel and Marx.
