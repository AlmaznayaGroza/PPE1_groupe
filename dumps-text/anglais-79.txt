false consciousness, in philosophy, particularly within critical theory
and other Marxist schools and movements, the notion that members of the
proletariat unwittingly misperceive their real position in society and
systematically misunderstand their genuine interests within the social
relations of production under capitalism. False consciousness denotes
people’s inability to recognize inequality, oppression, and exploitation
in a capitalist society because of the prevalence within it of views
that naturalize and legitimize the existence of social classes.

Despite its close assocation with Marxism, the term false consciousness
was never used by Karl Marx. The first treatment of false consciousness
as a theoretical concept occurred in History and Class Consciousness
(1923) by the Hungarian philosopher and literary critic György Lukács.
The concept was further developed in the 20th century by Marxist
scholars such as the German-born American philosopher Herbert Marcuse
and the French sociologist Henri Lefebvre. Since the late 20th century
the concept has been utilized outside explicitly Marxist theorizing in
studies of oppression on the basis of gender, sexual orientation,
ethnicity, and race. See also ideology: Hegel and Marx.
