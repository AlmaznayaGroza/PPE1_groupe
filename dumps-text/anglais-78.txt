   consciousness, a psychological condition defined by the English
   philosopher John Locke as “the perception of what passes in a man’s own
   mind.”

   (Read Yuval Noah Harari’s Britannica essay on “Nonconscious Man.”)

Early views

   In the early 19th century the concept was variously considered. Some
   philosophers regarded it as a kind of substance, or “mental stuff,”
   quite different from the material substance of the physical world.
   Others thought of it as an attribute characterized by sensation and
   voluntary movement, which separated animals and men from lower forms of
   life and also described the difference between the normal waking state
   of animals and men and their condition when asleep, in a coma, or under
   anesthesia (the latter condition was described as unconsciousness).
   Other descriptions included an analysis of consciousness as a form of
   relationship or act of the mind toward objects in nature, and a view
   that consciousness was a continuous field or stream of essentially
   mental “sense data,” roughly similar to the “ideas” of earlier
   empirical philosophers.

   nervous system disease: Altered consciousness

   The method employed by most early writers in observing consciousness
   was introspection—looking within one’s own mind to discover the laws of
   its operation. The limitations of the method became apparent when it
   was found that because of differing preconceptions, trained observers
   in the laboratory often could not agree on fundamental observations.

The behaviourist view

   The failure of introspection to reveal consistent laws led to the
   rejection of all mental states as proper subjects of scientific study.
   In behaviourist psychology, derived primarily from work of the American
   psychologist John B. Watson in the early 1900s, the concept of
   consciousness was irrelevant to the objective investigation of human
   behaviour and was doctrinally ignored in research. Neobehaviourists,
   however, adopted a more liberal posture toward mentalistic states such
   as consciousness.

Neurophysiological mechanisms

   That consciousness depends on the function of the brain has been known
   from ancient times. Although detailed understanding of the neural
   mechanisms of consciousness has not been achieved, correlations between
   states of consciousness and functions of the brain are possible. Levels
   of consciousness in terms of levels of alertness or responsiveness are
   correlated with patterns of electrical activity of the brain (brain
   waves) recorded by an electroencephalograph. During wide-awake
   consciousness the pattern of brain waves consists of rapid irregular
   waves of low amplitude or voltage. In contrast, during sleep, when
   consciousness can be said to be minimal, the brain waves are much
   slower and of greater amplitude, often coming in periodic bursts of
   slow waxing and waning amplitude.

   Both behavioral levels of consciousness and the correlated patterns of
   electrical activity are related to the function of a part of the
   brainstem called the reticular formation. Electrical stimulation of the
   ascending reticular systems arouses a sleeping cat to alert
   consciousness and simultaneously activates its brain waves to the
   waking pattern.

   It was once supposed that the neurophysiological mechanisms subserving
   consciousness and the higher mental processes must reside in the
   cortex. It is more likely, however, that the cortex serves the more
   specialized functions of integrating patterns of sensory experience and
   organizing motor patterns and that the ascending reticular system
   represents the neural structures most critically related to
   consciousness. The brainstem reticular formation should not, however,
   be called the seat of consciousness. It represents an integrative
   focus, functioning through its widespread interconnections with the
   cortex and other regions of the brain. See also introspection;
   unconscious.
