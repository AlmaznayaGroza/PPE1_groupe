consciousness, a psychological condition defined by the English
philosopher John Locke as “the perception of what passes in a man’s own
mind.”

(Read Yuval Noah Harari’s Britannica essay on “Nonconscious Man.”)

Early views

In the early 19th century the concept was variously considered. Some
philosophers regarded it as a kind of substance, or “mental stuff,”
quite different from the material substance of the physical world.
Others thought of it as an attribute characterized by sensation and
voluntary movement, which separated animals and men from lower forms of
life and also described the difference between the normal waking state
of animals and men and their condition when asleep, in a coma, or under
anesthesia (the latter condition was described as unconsciousness).
Other descriptions included an analysis of consciousness as a form of
relationship or act of the mind toward objects in nature, and a view
that consciousness was a continuous field or stream of essentially
mental “sense data,” roughly similar to the “ideas” of earlier empirical
philosophers.

nervous system disease: Altered consciousness

The method employed by most early writers in observing consciousness was
introspection—looking within one’s own mind to discover the laws of its
operation. The limitations of the method became apparent when it was
found that because of differing preconceptions, trained observers in the
laboratory often could not agree on fundamental observations.

The behaviourist view

The failure of introspection to reveal consistent laws led to the
rejection of all mental states as proper subjects of scientific study.
In behaviourist psychology, derived primarily from work of the American
psychologist John B. Watson in the early 1900s, the concept of
consciousness was irrelevant to the objective investigation of human
behaviour and was doctrinally ignored in research. Neobehaviourists,
however, adopted a more liberal posture toward mentalistic states such
as consciousness.

Neurophysiological mechanisms

That consciousness depends on the function of the brain has been known
from ancient times. Although detailed understanding of the neural
mechanisms of consciousness has not been achieved, correlations between
states of consciousness and functions of the brain are possible. Levels
of consciousness in terms of levels of alertness or responsiveness are
correlated with patterns of electrical activity of the brain (brain
waves) recorded by an electroencephalograph. During wide-awake
consciousness the pattern of brain waves consists of rapid irregular
waves of low amplitude or voltage. In contrast, during sleep, when
consciousness can be said to be minimal, the brain waves are much slower
and of greater amplitude, often coming in periodic bursts of slow waxing
and waning amplitude.

Both behavioral levels of consciousness and the correlated patterns of
electrical activity are related to the function of a part of the
brainstem called the reticular formation. Electrical stimulation of the
ascending reticular systems arouses a sleeping cat to alert
consciousness and simultaneously activates its brain waves to the waking
pattern.

It was once supposed that the neurophysiological mechanisms subserving
consciousness and the higher mental processes must reside in the cortex.
It is more likely, however, that the cortex serves the more specialized
functions of integrating patterns of sensory experience and organizing
motor patterns and that the ascending reticular system represents the
neural structures most critically related to consciousness. The
brainstem reticular formation should not, however, be called the seat of
consciousness. It represents an integrative focus, functioning through
its widespread interconnections with the cortex and other regions of the
brain. See also introspection; unconscious.
