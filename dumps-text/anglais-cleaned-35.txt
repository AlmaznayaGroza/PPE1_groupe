examining the role of conscience in making moral decisions

 examining the role of conscience in making moral decisions





q i disagree with some of the teachings of the catholic church

 i was once told that i don t have to follow all of the church s teachings if they violate my conscience

 but still i m not sure that s right



a first i want to commend you for asking this question

 the fact that
you were moved to ask demonstrates two things that god s grace can be
operative in every person who is open to him and secondly that you are
sincere in your desire to do god s will



i have run into a number of people in a similar predicament as you

 they
asked someone who ought to be able to give some guidance on what was a
difficult moral question

 in response they seemed to get an answer that
indicated that in the end they had to just “follow their conscience

”

i can understand this

 in the course of my life as a priest i have
like all of my brother priests been asked to weigh in on life
situations in which there were no easy or obvious answers

 at times
after going through all of the tools and resources the church offers for
right decisionmaking the right way to go remained foggy and difficult



 “when he listens to his conscience the prudent man can hear god
 speaking” —ccc 1777

in addition the catechism of the catholic church teaches “when he
listens to his conscience the prudent man can hear god speaking” ccc
1777

 because of this line and others that highlight the importance of
conscience it is tempting to take the default position of “whatever you
feel is right just do that

”

i am not denying this

 after all this is clearly part of the catechism


i m not about to go toetotoe with the catechism and think that i can
win

 i m not that smart

 but it misses crucial pieces of information



first while it is essential that we are sincere in the decisions we
make we don t only have an obligation to ourselves

 this is something
that we have lost in our culture



we think that “to thine own self be true” is the highest commandment

 it
isn t

 while it is good to be truthful and interiorly at peace we also
must be true to others

 it s even more essential that we are true to
god

 we may have an obligation to strive for authenticity but we also
have an obligation to obey god

 i am not the only one to whom i must be
true



second the church s teaching on conscience presumes knowledge of the
moral law

 this means that those who are exercising conscience know that
there is a real right and a real wrong

 unfortunately there are fewer
people who acknowledge this reality

 this places us in a unique place in
human history



 we may have an obligation to strive for authenticity but we also have
 an obligation to obey god



a recent study reported that only 8 percent of american teenagers
believe in a real right and a real wrong

 this ignorance is
unprecedented

 notre dame sociologist christian smith recently concluded
a nationwide study on the moral life of 18 to 29yearolds

 his
conclusion was that this age group generally speaking has neither the
vocabulary nor the categories to make moral decisions

 if conscience
depends on principles of right and wrong how will these young people
make decisions

 according to smith they base their decisions on
feelings



but conscience is not a feeling

 the catechism clearly states that
conscience “formulates its judgments according to reason in conformity
with the true good willed by the wisdom of the creator” ccc 1783

 this
means employing one s mind more than one s emotions to make decisions


conscience is not merely some feeling we get it is the critical
application of truth to the present issue



third it is true that a person “must not be forced to act contrary to
his conscience

 nor must he be prevented from acting according to his
conscience especially in religious matters” ccc 1782

 but this does
not mean doing whatever pleases me



let s take a potentially explosive issue

 when pope paul vi reinforced
the church s constant teaching against artificial birth control in the
document “humanae vitae” many couples were encouraged to dismiss this
teaching if it “violated their conscience

” unfortunately as a result
many couples were obliquely encouraged to invite a sinful practice into
their sexual relationship

 even more they were led to believe that they
could dismiss virtually any official and binding church teaching if they
disliked it



because that is all this comes down to

 the church s teaching on
contraception does not “violate” a person s conscience

 unless a person
truly believed that periodic abstinence in marriage was an evil which
is all that is being asked for through natural family planning then
there is no conscience issue here

 it is an issue of a not knowing or
understanding the church s teaching which could be remedied by asking
someone who knows b lacking the will to choose the good which is
always an issue for every person striving to live virtuously but not a
good reason to choose sin over virtue or c a matter of personal
dislike for a particular teaching or the church in general



 seek to do his will above absolutely all else

 even in very difficult
 circumstances god can be trusted



after all of this if we still have reasonable doubt regarding what to
do we ought to do the following

 first pray

 second it is wise to
examine your conscience regularly

 third choose to do good

 fourth
seek wise and holy counsel from someone who is not only educated in the
area of morality but who personally defers to the wisdom of christ and
his church in all things

 lastly trust god

 he comes to our aid in
times of weakness and confusion

 seek to do his will above absolutely
all else

 even in very difficult circumstances god can be trusted
