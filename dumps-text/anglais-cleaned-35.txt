Freedom
of
conscience
is
one
of
the
fundamental
freedoms
protected
by
section
2
of
the Canadian
Charter
of
Rights
and
Freedoms
.


[1
]

What
is
the
legal
impact
of
this
freedom
?



Ultimately
,
the
freedom
of
conscience
constitutionally
recognizes
“the
centrality
of
individual
conscience
and
the
inappropriateness
of
governmental
intervention
…
to
constrain
its
manifestation
.

”
[2
] In
fact
,
the
Supreme
Court
has
ruled
that
“an
emphasis
on
individual
conscience
and
individual
judgment
…
lies
at
the
heart
of
our
democratic
political
tradition
.


The
ability
of
each
citizen
to
make
free
and
informed
decisions
is
the
absolute
prerequisite
for
the
legitimacy
,
acceptability
,
and
efficacy
of
our
system
of
self‑government
.

”
[3
]

What
is
legally
protected
from
government
interference
?



The
only
Supreme
Court
case
considering
the
freedom
of
conscience
directly
is R
v
Morgentaler
.


[4
]
This
1988
case
dealt
with
the
constitutionality
of
abortion
laws
.


Justice
Wilson
stated
:
“
[t
]he
decision
whether
or
not
to
terminate
a
pregnancy
is
essentially
a
moral
decision
and
…
the
conscience
of
the
individual
must
be
paramount
.

”
[5
] She
also
held
that
the
freedoms
guaranteed
by
section
2
(a
)
“should
be
broadly
construed
to
extend
to
conscientiously-held
beliefs
whether
grounded
in
religion
or
in
a
secular
morality
.

”
[6
] However
,
since
Justice
Wilson
opposed
the
majority
decision
of
the
Court
,
her
judgment
is
not
considered
a
settled
statement
of
the
law
.



Without
guidance
from
the
Supreme
Court
,
lower
courts
have
had
to
figure
out
on
their
own
what
the
freedom
of
conscience
protects
.


From
the
limited
jurisprudence
that
exists
,
we
know
“
[t
]he
guarantee
of
freedom
of
conscience
…
is
directed
at
an
individual
'
s
overarching
…
normative
value
system
.

”
[7
] If
a
person’s
actions
are
not
motivated
by
a
“comprehensive
value
system”
(in
a
secular
context
)
,
 then
they
are
not
protected
by
section
2
(a
)
.


[8
] This
can
be
quite
limiting
:
when
people
have
argued
that
their
freedom
of
conscience
was
violated
by
mandatory
seatbelt
laws
for
example
,
their
arguments
failed
because
their
objections
were
not
supported
by
a
comprehensive
value
system
.



‘Insubstantial’
infringements
upon
a
person’s
conscience
are
also
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
guarantee
.


[9
] This
is
a
limitation
that
all
the
fundamental
freedoms
share
:
the freedom
of
religion for
instance
does
not
extend
to
protect
against
‘trivial’
infringements
upon
a
person’s
religious
practice
.


[10
]

One
of
the
few
lower
court
decisions
solely
considering
the
freedom
of
conscience
,
rather
than
conscience
and
religion
together
,
was Maurice
v
Canada
(Attorney
General
)
.


[11
]
Mr
.


Maurice
wanted
to
receive
vegetarian
meals
in
prison
.


Originally
,
he
was
provided
with
these
meals
in
recognition
of
his freedom
of
religion
.


However
,
when
he
renounced
his
religious
beliefs
,
the
prison
stopped
providing
vegetarian
meals
.


He
successfully
claimed
that
,
since
he
remained
vegetarian
for
conscientious
reasons
,
this
was
a
violation
of
his
freedom
of
conscience
.


[12
] The
Federal
Court
agreed
,
declaring
that
the
“Charter …
entitle
[s
]
the
Applicant
to
a
vegetarian
diet
.

”
[13
]

The
freedom
of
conscience
garnered
some
attention
in
2015
when
the
Supreme
Court
decided Carter
v
Canada
(Attorney
General
)
.


In
that
case
,
a
number
of
interveners
claimed
that
providing
access
to
physician-assisted
dying
would
infringe
the
freedom
of
conscience
of
medical
professionals
.


[14
] This
argument
went
beyond
the
scope
of
what
needed
to
be
decided
in
that
case
.


However
the
Court
noted
that
physician-assisted
dying
was
indeed
a
“matter
of
conscience”
and
that
at
some
point
“the Charter
rights
of
patients
and
physicians
will
need
to
be
reconciled
.

”
[15
]

What
are
the
limitations
on
the
freedom
of
conscience
?



While
the
freedom
of
conscience
is
a
fundamental
freedom
,
it
is
not
absolute
.


As
with
all
other
rights
and
freedoms
in
the Charter
,
if
a
breach
of
this
freedom
is
found
by
a
court
,
the
government
can
argue
that
its
laws
are
reasonable
and
justifiable
under section
1 of
the Charter
.
