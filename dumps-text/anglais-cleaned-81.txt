FALSE
consciousness
is
a
term
used
to
describe
the
way
in
which
exploited
,
oppressed
or
disadvantaged
groups
in
society
accept
,
assimilate
and
indeed
actively
defend
or
promote
ideas
which
ultimately
act
against
their
own
interests
.

 

It
can
apply
to
individuals
,
to
the
working
class
as
a
whole
,
or
to
sections
of
it
.

 It
is
closely
related
to
the
idea
of
hegemony
(see
Q&A
82
)
and
to
Marxist
concepts
of
alienation
,
reification
and
fetishism

(see
Q&A
51
)
.



“False
consciousness” often
manifests
itself
as
so-called
“common
sense”
.

 Examples
include
the
notion
that
capitalism
,
“private
enterprise”
,
profit
,
“the
market” is
simply
how
things
are
.

 That
those
who
have
power
or
earn
more
do
so
because
they
are
brighter
or
work
harder
than
the
rest
of
us
;
that
differences
in
opportunity
or
in
the
social
position
of
men
and
women
are
natural
,
determined
by
their
genes
;
that
the
status
quo
is
simply
just
“the
way
the
world
works” and
can’t
be
changed
.


 

False
consciousness
is
related
to
the
ever
changing
economic
and
social
base
of
capitalism
.


Marx
and
Engels
declared
:
“The
ideas
of
the
ruling
class
are
in
every
epoch
the
ruling
ideas
,
ie the
class
which
is
the
ruling
material
force
of
society
,
is
at
the
same
time
its
ruling
intellectual
force
.



“The
class
which
has
the
means
of
material
production
at
its
disposal
,
has
control
at
the
same
time
over
the
means
of
mental
production
,
so
that
thereby
,
generally
speaking
,
the
ideas
of
those
who
lack
the
means
of
mental
production
are
subject
to
it
.


The
ruling
ideas
are
nothing
more
than
the
ideal
expression
of
the
dominant
material
relationships
,
the
dominant
material
relationships
grasped
as
ideas
;
hence
of
the
relationships
which
make
the
one
class
the
ruling
one
,
therefore
,
the
ideas
of
its
dominance
.

”

Marx
and
Engels
argued
that
false
consciousness
applies
particularly
in
regard
to
abstract
ideas
,
such
as
property
rights
, “ie ideas
which
increasingly
take
on
the
form
of
universality
.


For
each
new
class
which
puts
itself
in
the
place
of
one
ruling
before
it
,
is
compelled
,
merely
in
order
to
carry
through
its
aim
,
to
represent
its
interest
as
the
common
interest
of
all
the
members
of
society
,
that
is
,
expressed
in
ideal
form
:
it
has
to
give
its
ideas
the
form
of
universality
,
and
represent
them
as
the
only
rational
,
universally
valid
ones”
.


 

The
term
“false
consciousness” was
first
used
by
Engels
who
emphasised
that
it
was
not
simply
a
passive
absorption
of
ruling-class
ideas
and
values
,
but
involves
an
active
acquiescence
in
adopting
and
developing
those
ideas
:
“a
process
accomplished
by
the
so-called
thinker
consciously
,
indeed
,
but
with
a
false
consciousness”
.

 
False
consciousness
was
an
aspect
of
ideology
but
,
Engels
declared
,
had
been
neglected
by
Marxists
because
of
“the
fatuous
notion
of
the
ideologists
that
because
we
deny
an
independent
historical
development
to
the
various
ideological
spheres
which
play
a
part
in
history
we
also
deny
them
any
effect
upon
history
.

”
 

Gramsci
in
the
1930s
further
developed
the
notion
of
false
consciousness
as
part
of
the
political
superstructure
,
as
a
vehicle
for
delivering
capitalist
hegemony
–
the
dominant
but
changing
set
of
cultural
and
ideological
norms
which
determine
the
boundaries
of
what
can
and
cannot
be
said
without
inviting
ridicule
or
antagonism
and
which
helps
the
existing
system
to
address
its
own
contradictions
,
adapt
and
survive
.


 

False
consciousness
is
in
part
a
consequence
of
the
hegemony
of
propaganda
,
of
the
institutions
of
the
capitalist
state
including
education
and
the
media
,
which
encourages
,
and
for
some
individuals
rewards
,
obedience
,
submission
and
conformity
.


 

But
it
manifests
itself
–
and
is
reinforced
– in
multiple
ways
in
everyday
life
.

 It
expresses
itself
(for
example
)
in
commodity
fetishism
—
the
way
relationships
between
people
(workers
and
owners
)
are
framed
as
relationships
between
things
(money
and
products
)
.



Commodity
fetishism
obscures
the
fact
that
relations
between
people
and
products
reflect
relationships
between
people
and
that
they
can
therefore
be
changed
.

 

False
consciousness
reveals
itself
above
all
in
conformity
–
how
the
need
to
keep
a
job
to
pay
the
rent
or
mortgage
,
feed
the
kids
,
heat
the
home
,
enjoy
the
occasional
luxury
becomes
seen
as
normal
,
the
natural
state
of
affairs
whilst
those
who
reap
the
rewards
of
your
labour
are
simply
enjoying
the
rights
of
ownership
.



Ultimately
,
false
consciousness
legitimates
the
power
of
the
ruling
class
.

 

Marx
and
Engels
declared “in
the
last
analysis
,
the
dominant
ideas
of
a
society
are
the
ideas
of
its
ruling
class”
–
legitimating
a
situation
in
which
one
class
has
power
.

 As
Terry
Eagleton
puts
it
,
ideology
is
“an
element
in
that
complex
structure
of
social
perception
which
ensures
that
the
situation
in
which
one
social
class
has
power
over
the
others
is
either
seen
by
most
members
of
the
society
as
‘natural’
,
or
not
seen
at
all
.

” 
 

But
(especially
in
its
cultural
aspects
)
“ideology
is
never
a
simple
reflection
of
a
ruling
class’s
ideas
:
on
the
contrary
,
it
is
always
a
complex
phenomenon
,
which
may
incorporate
conflicting
,
even
contradictory
,
views
of
the
world
.

”

Engels
for
example declared
that
art
is
far
richer
and
more
“opaque” than
political
and
economic
theory
because
it
is
less
explicit
,
less
purely
ideological
.

 So
challenging
false
consciousness
is
not

(just
)
a
matter
of
political
education
and
social
argument
.

 As
the
excellent
culture
pages
in
this
paper
show
,
the
battle
is
also
important
in
the
cultural
sphere
.

 

The
literary
critic
Ernst
Fischer
declared
that
art
can
(and
that
good
art
always
does
)
transcend
the
ideological
limits
of
its
time
“yielding
us
insights
into
the
realities”
.



False
consciousness
is
the
antithesis
of
class
consciousness
,
of
the
development
of
a
“class
for
itself”
.


Class
consciousness
involves
forging
a
counter-culture
which
sees
beyond
the
limitations
of
capitalism
.

 

That
task
is
vital
where
the
contradictions
of
capitalism
are
most
apparent
–
in
the
workplace
,
in
our
transport
or
energy
supply
systems
,
in
the
food
chain
,
in
the
climate
crisis
.

 

But
it
is
critical
also
in
neighbourhoods
,
in
communities
,
in
everyday
life
.


 

In
the
decades
following
the
collapse
of
“existing
socialism” in
the
Soviet
Union
and
subsequently
elsewhere
,
not
least
(for
example
)
in
Yugoslavia
(which
had
a
very
different
model
of
social
organisation
and
political
engagement
)
some
on
the
left
experienced
self-doubt
.

 

Some
even
conceived
that
capitalism
represented
“the
end
of
history” –
that
self-interest
and
exploitation
was
the
inevitable
state
of
humanity
.

 

But
socialism
survived
–
and
survives
– not
least
in
Cuba
,
in
perhaps
the
least propitious
of
circumstances
,
due
to
the
consciousness
and
engagement
of
workers
and
communities
in
protecting
the
gains
of
their
revolution
.


And
socialist
ideas
continue to
inspire
struggles
for
social
justice
and
progress
throughout
the
world
.

 

In
Britain
,
too
,
resistance
to
capitalism’s
escalating
economic
crisis
and
public
support
for
struggles
over
jobs
,
pay
,
conditions
,
and
the
social
wage
reflects
a
growing
understanding
that
things
can
and
must
change
.



Central
to
Marx’s
concept
of
historical
materialism
is
the
understanding
that
it
is
not
consciousness
that
determines
people’s
existence
,
but
their
social
existence
that
determines
their
consciousness
.

 

However
the
form
that
consciousness
takes
can
vary
.

 As
Gawain
Little
pointed
out
in
an
article
in
this
paper
,
the
hegemony
exercised
by
capital
is
in
a
constant
process
of
being
remade
and
reconfigured
.

 

As
he
argued
,
“It
is
not
enough
to
propose
alternatives
,
or
even
to
fight
to
win
people
to
them
.


We
must
change
the
very
‘common
sense’ of
society
,
enabling
people
to
envision
a
future
beyond
capitalism
.

”
 

That
is
probably
the
single
biggest
challenge
facing
all
socialists
today
.
