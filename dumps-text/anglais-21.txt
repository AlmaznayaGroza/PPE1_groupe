    The New Grown-Up

    There’s been a fundamental shift in how we define adulthood—and at
    what pace it occurs. PT’s authors consider how a once iron-clad
    construct is now up for grabs—and what it means for young people’s
    mental health today.

Key points

-   The ambiguous nature of conscience is well-dramatized in Mark
    Twain's "Huckleberry Finn."
-   According to Hemingway, we should trust our authentic feelings
    rather than what we've absorbed unconsciously from our family and
    culture.
-   What's morally ideal and what's possible can at times be worlds
    apart—as is the gulf between what people aspire to and what they're
    capable of.
-   From an ecclesiastical perspective, an evil conscience is synonymous
    with sinning against God, and one must pay penance to be forgiven.

Few novelists have captured the ultimate ambiguity of conscience better
than Mark Twain did in Huckleberry Finn. Jim, the escaped slave who
accompanies Huck down the river on a raft, is on a journey to reunite
with his beloved family (whom white people have separated from him). In
several scenes, Huck, beset with guilt for not handing Jim over to the
authorities as his conscience naggingly instructs him to, anguishes over
his default role as an escapee's accomplice.

Finally, subconsciously recognizing Jim not only as the devoted,
concerned father figure he never had but in many ways as a paragon of
virtue, despite the color of his skin, Huck decides to disobey his
conscience. In doing so, he demonstrates the courage many literary
critics have cited as constituting the novel's moral climax:

  I was a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two
  things, and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my
  breath, and then says to myself: "Alright then, I'll go to hell."

In addition, note these two later passages, which also explain
indirectly why Twain would have readers question the racist messages
endemic to a prejudicial society:

  It don't make no difference whether you do right or wrong, a person's
  conscience ain't got no sense, and just goes for him anyway.

But because Huck isn't yet mature or free-thinking enough to triumph
over the cultural bias of the culture that's "educated" him, he's
compelled to rationalize his decision to protect Jim through some
curious verbal gymnastics, namely:

  I knowed he [Jim] was white inside.

To employ Freud's terminology, Huck is coming from his id, doing what by
nature he's drawn to do while forcefully resisting the strong
gravitational pull of his guilt-inducing superego. But when these brief
excerpts are explored in the context of Twain's general handling of
whites in the novel, it's obvious that (as traditionally understood)
Twain has interchanged id and superego.

Metaphorically, that is, the connotations of whiteness are quite
black—and black, ironically, has been transposed with white. What Twain
characterizes is that a slave can exemplify all that's most admirable in
humanity while the (purportedly) most "lily-white" individuals may
indeed illustrate the reverse.

For Huck to act "conscientiously," by denying Jim his personal
freedom—which, despite tremendous personal risks, Jim so desperately
seeks because of his dedication to his wife and children—would be to
mirror his society's corrupted conscience. Huck's safeguarding of Jim
from all the people who'd prefer (primarily for ignoble reasons) to
return him to slavery can be comprehended as depicting a true versus an
artificial, culturally-derived conscience.

Ernest Hemingway, deeply influenced by Twain's plain-spoken style and
exemplifying a similar interest in discovering how best to distinguish
between virtuous and villainous behavior, offers this reality-based
solution in Death in the Afternoon:

  What is moral is what you feel good after, and what is immoral is what
  you feel bad after.

Here, too, we're presented with an idealistically pragmatic perspective
deviating from the far more conventional morals or mores of society.
Hemingway's position is that deciding how to evaluate the ethical
ramifications of behavior ought to be based on personal, reality-derived
sentiment. It's a matter of trusting one's authentic feelings rather
than what one has absorbed unconsciously, both from how their family
raised them and the moral consensus of their culture.

Writers worldwide have historically questioned popular assumptions about
the fixed nature of good and evil. So these two authors can be seen as
representative of so many writers who came to regard accepted
definitions of morality as simplistic—and frequently false.

Defining conscience from a religious perspective

Let's now look at customary definitions of conscience to illustrate how
they stop short of accounting for the many ambiguities so often found in
reality, for what's ideal and what's practically possible can at times
be worlds apart—as can the gulf between what people aspire to and what
they're actually capable of.

The literature online relating particularly to the oxymoronic concept of
an evil conscience emanates mostly from theology—and we'll deal with
this orientation first. The approach that fundamentalist religion takes
toward ethics is absolutist, placing a person's behavior into neat,
generally unqualified categories. For example, in a sermon marshaling
all of its supporting evidence from Scriptures, Greg Stuckey defines any
human wrongdoing as—purely and simply—evil. So anyone afflicted with
such a presumed immoral conscience will experience as good what the
Bible delineates as evil, and vice versa.

Defining such people as sociopathic (though without employing this
secular terminology), Stuckey posits that they glory in and brag about
precisely what they should be ashamed of. Rather than feeling troubled
by hurting others, they perversely take joy in it. Looked at from this
dogmatic ecclesiastical stance, an evil conscience is synonymous with
sinning against God—and it requires paying penance to God if one is to
be forgiven.

In my next post, I'll explore this seminal topic from a secular point of
view and also explore the curious moral ambiguity of the superego. And
my final post on this subject will get into the moral rationalizations
people offer for bad behavior which they can't—or won't—own up to.
