 demand of the question 
 
 introduction

 what is moral conscience

 
 
 body

 discuss the role of moral conscience in ethical behaviour

 
 
 conclusion

 way forward

 


 moral conscience is a part of the cognitive process in mind that tells
whether an act is morally right or wrong

 in other words it is
awareness of moral principles and whether act done is in accordance with
these principles or not

 it is an instrument for selfcontrol
correction and regulation

 the proper understanding of the moral
conscience is basic to our understanding of morality and to an ethical
conduct



role of moral conscience in ethical behaviour

1

 right choices human actions entail free decisions concerning ends
 and means

 these actions have an ethical dimension because they
 concern making right choices based on the analysis of the nature of
 acts and the intentions and circumstances that are involved

 moral
 conscience help guide people to follow the right means to a right
 end


2

 inner guide moral conscience is our inner guide and it helps you
 figure out how to make good choices

 as we grow up we learn right
 from wrong

 our moral conscience is the thought and feeling we have
 that tells us whether something is a right or wrong thing to do or
 say

 thus it is a consistent guide to ethical decision making


3

 source of information the moral conscience is considered the
 proximate norm of conduct because it is the immediate source of
 information guiding human actions

 it directs human actions so that
 a person can transcend his animal instincts and human inclinations


 moral conscience allows man to exercise reason and thus allow an
 objective decision and act based on right values


4

 decision making without moral conscience a person would doubt even
 the smallest decisions

since the judgment of moral conscience is a
 judgment about how an action conforms or does not conform to natural
 law then it is obligatory to act according to one s conscience


 although there are persons who have a doubtful conscience which
 renders them unable to decide upon actions easily

 a wellformed
 moral conscience is effective because it makes practical judgments
 with relative ease or after seeking necessary advice


5

 resolving ethical dilemmas a human being always comes across
 ethical dilemmas in the decision making process

 moral conscience
 acts as the guide for taking correct decisions when we have to
 choose between competing sets of principles in a given usually
 undesirable or perplexing situation

 example  helping accident
 victims on your way to an interview


6

 rational decision through our individual moral conscience one
 becomes aware of his deeply held moral principles and motivates
 accordingly to act upon those principles removing conflicts

 as we
 assess our character our behaviour and ultimately our self against
 those principles conscience leads to proper analysis of good and
 bad of the situation and proper evaluation of various options


7

 ethical awareness this is our ability to recognise ethical values
 and principles

 the moral conscience enables the human mind to
 understand the world in moral terms

 this enhances our ability to
 make practical decisions in light of ethical values and principles


8

 conscientious objection the conscientious objection is very
 important in public services

 tostay impartial it is important that
 public servants must object to any favours and corrupt activities


 moral conscience helps in conscientious objection by making an
 individual aware of the impact of his decisions on larger public



limitation of moral conscience in ethical behaviour

1

 individuality moral conscience is highly personal and varies with
 individuals

 for example a person might think killing muslim as
 moral in order to take revenge

 in his conscience it is moral to
 kill muslim and help hindu cause


2

 social norms moral conscience is guided by the social norms in
 general

 it can impact the ethical thinking of an individual leading
 to unethical behaviour

 for example in islamic countries many are
 misguided in name of jihad and act of terrorism is held moral and as
 an act of sacrifice for the cause of religion


3

 courage despite being morally conscience about what is right an
 individual might lack courage to act ethically

 for example a civil
 servant might know that his colleague is taking bribes he may not
 act consciously due to fear of political links that his colleague
 has


4

 other factors many other factors like honesty values education
 etc

 define an individual s morals

 thus one might not know what he
 is doing is immoral

 for example a person might beat his wife as in
 his conscience mind it is not immoral due to patriarchal mindset



thus the moral conscience plays an important role in making moral
decisions and actions

 the reason behind conscience as the ultimate
highest determiner of moral action and its authority is the idea that
when conscience and all other principles are properly understood they
promote and motivate us to act that are in accordance with our nature
