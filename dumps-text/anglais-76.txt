   concept, see Altered state of consciousness.
   Medical condition
   Altered level of consciousness

   An intracranial hemorrhage, one cause of altered level of consciousness
   Specialty Psychiatry, Neurology

   An altered level of consciousness is any measure of arousal other than
   normal. Level of consciousness (LOC) is a measurement of a person's
   arousability and responsiveness to stimuli from the environment.^[1] A
   mildly depressed level of consciousness or alertness may be classed as
   lethargy; someone in this state can be aroused with little
   difficulty.^[1] People who are obtunded have a more depressed level of
   consciousness and cannot be fully aroused.^[1]^[2] Those who are not
   able to be aroused from a sleep-like state are said to be
   stuporous.^[1]^[2] Coma is the inability to make any purposeful
   response.^[1]^[2] Scales such as the Glasgow coma scale have been
   designed to measure the level of consciousness.

   An altered level of consciousness can result from a variety of factors,
   including alterations in the chemical environment of the brain (e.g.
   exposure to poisons or intoxicants), insufficient oxygen or blood flow
   in the brain, and excessive pressure within the skull. Prolonged
   unconsciousness is understood to be a sign of a medical emergency.^[3]
   A deficit in the level of consciousness suggests that both of the
   cerebral hemispheres or the reticular activating system have been
   injured.^[4] A decreased level of consciousness correlates to increased
   morbidity (sickness) and mortality (death).^[5] Thus it is a valuable
   measure of a patient's medical and neurological status. In fact, some
   sources consider level of consciousness to be one of the vital
   signs.^[3]^[6]

Definition

   [edit]

   Scales and terms to classify the levels of consciousness differ, but in
   general, reduction in response to stimuli indicates an altered level of
   consciousness:

   CAPTION: Levels of consciousness

   Level Summary (Kruse)^[2] Description
   Metaconscious Preternatural People who possess the ability to monitor
   and control their own cognitive processes in addition to meeting all
   the criteria indicative of a normal level of consciousness. In the
   field of cognitive neuroscience, metacognitive monitoring and control
   have been viewed as functions of the prefrontal cortex, which receives
   sensory input signals from divergent cortical regions and implements
   control through feedback loops which are established utilizing the
   underlying mechanisms of neuroplasticity (see chapters by Schwartz &
   Bacon and Shimamura, in Dunlosky & Bjork, 2008).^[7]
   Conscious Normal Assessment of LOC involves checking orientation:
   people who are able promptly and spontaneously to state their name,
   location, and the date or time are said to be oriented to self, place,
   and time, or "oriented X3".^[8] A normal sleep stage from which a
   person is easily awakened is also considered a normal level of
   consciousness.^[9] "Clouding of consciousness" is a term for a mild
   alteration of consciousness with alterations in attention and
   wakefulness.^[9]
   Confused Disoriented; impaired thinking and responses People who do not
   respond quickly with information about their name, location, and the
   time are considered "obtuse" or "confused".^[8] A confused person may
   be bewildered, disoriented, and have difficulty following
   instructions.^[9] The person may have slow thinking and possible memory
   time loss. This could be caused by sleep deprivation, malnutrition,
   allergies, environmental pollution, drugs (prescription and
   nonprescription), and infection.
   Delirious Disoriented; restlessness, hallucinations, sometimes
   delusions Some scales have "delirious" below this level, in which a
   person may be restless or agitated and exhibit a marked deficit in
   attention.^[2]
   Somnolent Sleepy A somnolent person shows excessive drowsiness and
   responds to stimuli only with incoherent mumbles or disorganized
   movements.^[8]
   Obtunded Decreased alertness; slowed psychomotor responses In
   obtundation, a person has a decreased interest in their surroundings,
   slowed responses, and sleepiness.^[9]
   Stuporous Sleep-like state (not unconscious); little/no spontaneous
   activity People with an even lower level of consciousness, stupor, only
   respond by grimacing or drawing away from painful stimuli.^[8]
   Comatose Cannot be aroused; no response to stimuli Comatose people do
   not even make this response to stimuli, have no corneal or gag reflex,
   and they may have no pupillary response to light.^[8]

   Altered level of consciousness is sometimes described as altered
   sensorium.

Glasgow Coma Scale

   [edit]
   Main article: Glasgow Coma Scale

   The most commonly used tool for measuring LOC objectively is the
   Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). It has come into almost universal use for
   assessing people with brain injury,^[2] or an altered level of
   consciousness. Verbal, motor, and eye-opening responses to stimuli are
   measured, scored, and added into a final score on a scale of 3–15, with
   a lower score being a more decreased level of consciousness.^[citation
   needed]

Others

   [edit]

   The AVPU scale is another means of measuring LOC: people are assessed
   to determine whether they are alert, responsive to verbal stimuli,
   responsive to painful stimuli, or unresponsive.^[3]^[6] To determine
   responsiveness to voice, a caregiver speaks to, or, failing that, yells
   at the person.^[3] Responsiveness to pain is determined with a mild
   painful stimulus such as a pinch; moaning or withdrawal from the
   stimulus is considered a response to pain.^[3] The ACDU scale, like
   AVPU, is easier to use than the GCS and produces similarly accurate
   results.^[10] Using ACDU, a patient is assessed for alertness,
   confusion, drowsiness, and unresponsiveness.^[10]

   The Grady Coma Scale classes people on a scale of I to V along a scale
   of confusion, stupor, deep stupor, abnormal posturing, and coma.^[9]

Pathophysiology

   [edit]

   Although the neural science behind alertness, wakefulness, and arousal
   are not fully known, the reticular formation is known to play a role in
   these.^[9] The ascending reticular activating system is a postulated
   group of neural connections that receives sensory input and projects to
   the cerebral cortex through the midbrain and thalamus from the
   reticular formation.^[9] Since this system is thought to modulate
   wakefulness and sleep, interference with it, such as injury, illness,
   or metabolic disturbances, could alter the level of consciousness.^[9]

   Normally, stupor and coma are produced by interference with the brain
   stem, such as can be caused by a lesion or indirect effects, such as
   brain herniation.^[9] Mass lesions in the brain stem normally cause
   coma due to their effects on the reticular formation.^[11] Mass lesions
   that occur above the tentorium cerebelli normally do not significantly
   alter the level of consciousness unless they are very large or affect
   both cerebral hemispheres.^[9]

Diagnosis

   [edit]

   Assessing LOC involves determining an individual's response to external
   stimuli.^[12] Speed and accuracy of responses to questions and
   reactions to stimuli such as touch and pain are noted.^[12] Reflexes,
   such as the cough and gag reflexes, are also means of judging LOC.^[12]
   Once the level of consciousness is determined, clinicians seek clues
   for the cause of any alteration.^[9] Usually the first tests in the ER
   are pulse oximetry to determine if there is hypoxia, serum glucose
   levels to rule out hypoglycemia. A urine drug screen may be sent. A CT
   head is very important to obtain to rule out bleed. In cases where
   meningitis is suspected, a lumbar puncture must be performed. A serum
   TSH is an important test to order. In select groups consider vitamin
   B12 levels. Checking serum ammonia is particularly advised in neonatal
   coma to discern inborn errors of metabolism.^[citation needed]

Differential diagnosis

   [edit]

   A lowered level of consciousness indicate a deficit in brain
   function.^[4] Level of consciousness can be lowered when the brain
   receives insufficient oxygen (as occurs in hypoxia); insufficient blood
   (as occurs in shock, in children for example due to intussusception);
   or has an alteration in the brain's chemistry.^[3] Conditions of the
   heart and conditions of the lungs can alter consciousness. Metabolic
   disorders such as diabetes mellitus and uremia can alter
   consciousness.^[12] Hypo- or hypernatremia (decreased and elevated
   levels of sodium, respectively) as well as dehydration can also produce
   an altered LOC.^[13] A pH outside of the range the brain can tolerate
   will also alter LOC.^[9] Exposure to drugs (e.g. alcohol) or toxins may
   also lower LOC,^[3] as may a core temperature that is too high or too
   low (hyperthermia or hypothermia). Increases in intracranial pressure
   (the pressure within the skull) can also cause altered LOC. It can
   result from traumatic brain injury such as concussion.^[12] Ischemic
   stroke and brain bleeding are other causes of altered
   consciousness.^[12] Infections of the central nervous system may also
   be associated with decreased LOC; for example, an altered LOC is the
   most common symptom of encephalitis.^[14] Neoplasms within the
   intracranial cavity can also affect consciousness,^[12] as can epilepsy
   and post-seizure states.^[9] A decreased LOC can also result from a
   combination of factors.^[12] A concussion, which is a mild traumatic
   brain injury (MTBI) may result in decreased LOC.^[citation needed]

Treatment

   [edit]

   Treatment depends on the degree of decrease in consciousness and its
   underlying cause. Initial treatment often involves the administration
   of dextrose if the blood sugar is low as well as the administration of
   oxygen, naloxone and thiamine.^[citation needed]
