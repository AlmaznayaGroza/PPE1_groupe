religious views on conscience

aquinas natural moral law

aquinas developed natural law as a form of religious ethics

 natural law
is the theory that god has designed a moral law into human nature such
that we are naturally inclined to certain moral behaviours

 ethics is
therefore about using reason to discover the natural law within our
nature so that we can conform our actions to it in order to fulfil our
purpose telos of glorifying god by following his law



the primary precepts synderesis

aquinas claims that reason is a power of the human soul and synderesis
is the habit or ability of reason to discover foundational first
principles of god s natural moral law which gives us insight into god s
intentions for human life and thus our telos



“the first practical principles belong to a special natural habit 
which we call “synderesis” is said to incite to good and to murmur at
evil inasmuch as through first principles we proceed to discover and
judge of what we have discovered

”

the first principle synderesis tells us is called the synderesis rule
that the good is what all things seek as their endgoal telos

 this
means that human nature has an innate orientation to the good



“this therefore is the principle of law that good must be done and evil
avoided

”

in addition to this synderesis tells us the primary precepts worship
god live in an orderly society reproduce educate protect and
preserve human life and defend the innocent

 these primary precepts are
the articulation of the orientations in our nature toward the good the
natural inclinations of our goddesigned human nature put into the form
of ethical principles by human reason



secondary precepts conscientia

the primary precepts are applied to situations or types of actions – a
process called conscientia

 the judgement we then acquire is a secondary
precept

 e

g euthanasia the primary precepts don t say anything about
euthanasia exactly but we can use our reason to apply the primary
precepts to euthanasia and realise that it goes against the primary
precept of protecting and preserving human life

 arguably it even
disrupts the functioning of society too

 therefore we can conclude the
secondary precept that euthanasia is wrong



aquinas view of the conscience

natural law is aquinas theory on how god is the grounding and source of
morality

 conscience is about the human psychology involved in
understanding and applying natural moral law

 conscience is ratio
reason used to understand and apply god s natural law



aquinas claims that the classic features of conscience follow from the
application of our knowledge of the natural moral law to our moral
actions in three ways

1

 witness – by knowing whether we have done or not done something


2

 bind incite – “through the conscience we judge that something
 should be done or not done”
3

 accuse torment rebuke – “by conscience we judge that something
 done is well done or ill done”

this is how the conscience causes guilt

 conscience is our ability to
know whether we have done something whether we should have done it and
whether it was done well

 if we have done something wrong our
conscience will accuse torment and rebuke us – causing feelings of
guilt



because human reason is fallible the conscience thereby becomes
fallible

 we could be mistaken for example when we don t know how a
general rule applies to a certain situation mistake in conscientia


aquinas claims that the synderesis rule and the primary precepts cannot
be mistaken or lost from the human mind

 however mistakes can be made
in conscientia – the application of the primary precepts to moral
situations or actions to derive secondary precepts

 these mistakes can
result from original sin unvirtuous habits and corrupt culture



“as to those general principles the natural law in the abstract can
nowise be blotted out from men s hearts

 but as to the secondary
precepts the natural law can be blotted out from the human heart
either by evil persuasions just as in speculative matters errors occur
in respect of necessary conclusions or by vicious customs and corrupt
habits”

real vs apparent goods

 we might reason that something is in accord with
our nature s goal and is thus good when really is not

 such actions are
called apparent goods because they only appear good to someone engaged
in faulty reasoning

 they are not real goods

 despite this potential for
our conscience judging something bad to be good aquinas still insists
we must follow it

“every judgment of conscience be it right or wrong is obligatory he
who acts against his conscience always sins”

this is because if you choose to act against your conscience then you
are choosing to do something you believe to be evil

 conscience is thus
always binding 



vincible vs invincible ignorance

whether errors in conscience that lead to sinful acts will be forgiven
or pardoned depends on the type of ignorance that caused the error



invincible ignorance involves circumstances where a person could not
have known better and so are not to blame for their action

 for example
if someone drunkenly jumps in front of your car and there was nothing
you could have done you would not be held responsible for hitting them


actions that go against the natural law but are done due to invincible
ignorance are technically not voluntary and thus not sin



“it is not imputed as a sin to man if he fails to know what he is
unable to know

 consequently ignorance of such like things is called
 invincible ”

vincible ignorance involves circumstances where a person could have
known better and so are to blame for their action

 it typically involves
some kind of negligence or ignorance of which moral principle is
relevant to a situation

 for example if a fire breaks out in a building
because it wasn t looked after properly then the person in charge of
that is to blame for their action

 they were ignorant that the fire
would happen but they should have known better

 actions that go against
the natural law done out of vincible ignorance are sins because we
should have known better



“invincible ignorance not being voluntary since it is not in our
power to be rid of it is not a sin on the other hand vincible
ignorance is a sin if it be about matters one is bound to know

”

arguably aquinas is too optimistic about human nature

 if you consider
the terrible things that humans have done and that entire cultures have
embraced e

g

 slavery and nazism it starts to look like human nature
is not as positive as aquinas thought

 if we really had an orientation
towards the good and the primary precepts accurately described our
nature s orientation then we should not expect to find the extent of
human evil we do



however aquinas claim is merely that human nature contains an
orientation towards the good it doesn t involve a commitment to humans
actually doing more good than evil nor to incredibly evil acts or
cultures occurring infrequently

 aquinas acknowledges that there are
many reasons we might fail to do good despite having an orientation
towards it

 these include original sin mistakes in conscientia lacking
virtue and a corrupt culture



the fact that humanity could sink so low as to produce nazism and the
holocaust is strong evidence against the human nature having an
orientation toward the good



descriptive moral relativism

aquinas was not as aware of different cultures as we are today

 as we
now know thanks to modern anthropology there are vastly different moral
beliefs across cultures this is called descriptive moral relativism


fletcher made the argument that this could be taken as evidence that
there is not an innate godgiven ability of reason to discover the
natural law since then we should expect more moral agreement

 freud
would argue that it is society which conditions our moral views

 there
either is no natural moral law or human reason is unable to discover it


so what aquinas thought was human nature was really just his culture



however there do seem to be some core similarities between the
moralities of different cultures such as not killing for no reason and
rules about stealing

 reproduction and education are also universal


moral thinkers from different cultures came up with similar moral
prescriptions such as the golden rule to treat others as you would like
to be treated which can be found in ancient chinese philosophy
hinduism judaism and christianity

 this could be taken to show that
moral views are determined by a universal human moral nature



alternative explanation these crosscultural similarities in moral
codes might have resulted from a biologically evolved morality rather
than one designed by a god however which would mean it is not related
to a telos designed by god



alternatively crosscultural morality might result merely from the
basic requirement of a society to function

 if anyone could kill or
steal from anyone else for no reason whenever they wanted it s hard to
see how a society could exist

 that might create an existential pressure
which influences the moral thinkers of a society yielding prescriptions
such as the golden rule

 crosscultural ethics therefore has a practical
reality as its basis not god and not or not only evolution



aquinas natural theology

aquinas believed that human reason could never know or understand god


however aquinas is a proponent of natural theology through reason which
he claimed could support faith in god

 human reason can gain knowledge
of god s natural moral law through the ability of human reason to know
the synderesis rule and primary precepts



karl barth argued that aquinas natural law theory was a false natural
theology which placed a dangerous overreliance on human reason

 barth
argued that if humans were able to know god or god s morality through
their own efforts then revelation would be unnecessary

 yet god
clearly thought revelation necessary as he sent jesus



barth also argued that “the finite has no capacity for the infinite”
our finite minds cannot grasp god s infinite being

 whatever humans
discover through reason is therefore not divine so to think it is must
then amount to idolatry – the worship of earthly things

 barth argued
idolatry can lead to worship of nations and then even to movements like
the nazis

 it follows for barth that after the corruption of the fall
human reason cannot reach god or figure out right and wrong by itself


only faith in god s revelation in the bible is valid



in defence of aquinas he is not suggesting that our finite minds can
understand god s nature or goodness eternal law

 aquinas is only
suggesting that reason can understand the natural law god created within
our nature

 if reason only has this goal of supporting faith in such
ways then it cannot make revealed theology unnecessary



 tillich defends aquinas to a degree arguing that barth was too
negative in denying the possibility of reason discovering anything
whatsoever of the natural law



“there is selfdeception in every denial of the natural moral law the
very statement that man is estranged from his created nature presupposes
an experience of the abyss between what he essentially is and what is
existentially is

 even a weak or misled conscience is still a
conscience namely the silent voice of man s own essential nature
judging his actual being” – tillich



to deny that our conscience can discover the natural law is to claim
that there is a gap between what we currently are and what we could be


yet to have an awareness of that gap is to have a conscience that is
aware of its fallen state

 so it is contradictory to deny the natural
law

 even it now involves a weakened conscience that still tells us at
least something of the direction we have fallen in and the direction
back towards righteousness



however whatever a weak and misled conscience discovers is surely not
god s morality

 humanity believing it has the ability to know anything
of god is the same arrogance that caused adam and eve to disobey god


humanity believing that it has the power to figure out right and wrong
is what led to the arrogant certainty of the nazis in their own
superiority

 the arrogance of natural theology is evidence of a human
inability to be humble enough to simply have faith



psychological views on the conscience

sigmund freud

freud thought the conscience was just the result of psychological forces
that science could understand

 freud believed the mind was divided into
the id our unconscious animalistic desires ego our conscious
decisionmaking self and the super ego the part of us that “stores”
the values we introjected unconsciously adopted from authority
figures during childhood and is the source of our moral feelings

 when
a desire bubbles up from the unconscious id into our conscious ego we
become aware of wanting to act on it but our super ego then tells us
whether the values of our society allow it

 if so we can act on it

 if
not we have been conditioned to repress that desire which freud
thought responsible for many mental problems



the ethical implications is that conscience is not the voice of god in
us it is just what our society wants from us

 our society might be good
or bad therefore our conscience is not the best guide if freud is
right

 furthermore there might not even be a good or bad if morality
is merely the conditioning of societies on its members



freud was influenced by nietzsche who argued that human conscious mind
what freud called the ego developed by necessity when humans underwent
the radical change from huntergatherer to farmer

 our natural
animalistic instincts what freud called the id were of less use to us
in the new environment of society in fact they were a hinderance as
they called on us to behave in ways that would make society fall apart


consciousness emerged as the space inbetween our instincts and the
outside world as a mediator which had to decide which instincts to act
on and which not to



freud s theory of psychosexual development relates to his theory of the
id ego and superego

 freud thought that the process of being socialised
– being inducted into society – required children to learn to control
their id

 this process of learning was developmental in that it comes in
stages

 if selfcontrol is not learned at a particular stage it can
lead to issues later in life



oral stage between birth and 1

5 years old

 babies breastfeed and
explore the world by putting things in their mouth

 failure to develop
properly during this stage can lead to smoking or overeating



anal stage 1

5 – 3 years old

 the ego develops at this time and
pleasure is gained through exercising selfcontrol over going to the
toilet

 those who overlycontrol become a control freak those who do
not learn to control enough become messy



phallic stage 36 years old

 children become aware of their genitals
and their gender

 oedipus and electra complex develops – jealousy of the
parent of the same sex for the time and attention they take from the
parent of opposite same sex

 problems moving through this stage cause
intimacy issues later in life



latency stage 6puberty

 sexual desire develops and is repressed


gender roles are learned



mature genital stage lasts until death

 controlled sexual desires
result in a desire for love and marriage

 a person now has a fully
developed conscience where the ego controls the id with reference to the
superego



freud has been criticised by contemporary psychologists for not being
empirical enough

 karl popper criticised freud s theory for being
 unfalsifiable as it could not say what would prove it wrong

 this
means it is not true empiricism

 freud studied a small sample size of
patients a poor crosssection of society and did not do proper
experiments so he is unscientific

 however popper was clear that he
wasn t saying there was absolutely nothing of value in freud s ideas –
just that they needed to be subjected to proper scientific experiment
and testing



piaget was a contemporary psychologist who developed better empirical
methods of experiment than freud but came to similar conclusions so can
thus be seen to defend freud to some degree from the accusation of being
unscientific

 he studied the development of children and argued that
there occurs a fundamental shift in the nature of conscience 

 before
the age of 11 children have what he called heteronomous morality

 this
means they merely associate actions as bad because of the influence of
their authority figures like parents

 for example an 8 year old child
dangerously runs into a road and their parent yells at them

 the child
will learn not to do that again but not because they have cognitively
understood that running into the road will cause them injury or death
which would be a bad thing but because they merely associate the action
of running into the road with the loud scary noise of their parents
shouting occurring

 after 11 year old however piaget argued that the
autonomous morality develops in children where they can begin to have
abstract cognitive moral beliefs about how one ought to act and why



freud s critique of religion s approach to developing the conscience

maintaining social order depends on people repressing their antisocial
instincts e

g

 for sex and violence

 religion encourages repression
and for that freud thought it had done “great services for human
civilization” in the “taming of the asocial instincts”

 nonetheless
freud thought that the christian belief system had long passed its
usefulness because a secular society would be far superior at enabling
selfcontrol

 so society would be better off outgrowing religion



freud evaluates religion and its doctrines not as claims about reality
but as strategies for controlling instincts

 for example for freud
belief in and propagation of the idea that human nature is corrupted by
original sin is really just a method of dealing with our natural
instincts but a primitive and childish method that actually causes as
much immorality and unhappiness as it prevents

 viewing humanity as
inherently sinful and only god as good who easily forgives sins does
not provide the proper motivation for following religious social rules
causing frequent “backslidings into sin” and seeking of penance



after millennia of religious rule too many people are still unhappy
being controlled by social rules

 freud claims this is because the
religious approach to conscience is external imposition by authority
similar to how children are treated the result being comparable to a
 childhood neurosis 

 although rules are in place to reduce suffering
they also cause suffering through repression and thus inspire
unconscious resentment against civilisation



freud argues that the better approach for society would be autonomy


people can rationally understand that repressing their instincts is for
the good of social order making them capable of choosing autonomously
to follow social rules

 this makes them more likely to happily accept
and follow them

 furthermore this would also introduce flexibility into
the rules

 if it were accepted that the social rules of human origin
with the intention of improving society then they could be continually
improved further encouraging adherence to them



ultimately the effectiveness of religious rules as tools for social
order depends on the notion that a god has decreed them which
inexorably burdens religious social order with the psychology of
external imposition and the inflexibility of eternal unchanging laws of
god 

 freud concludes that society would be much better off if it could
admit that the purpose of its social rules is the maintenance of social
order rather than their “pretended sanctity”



aquinas natural law ethics arguably gets around freud s critique
because aquinas thought that following of the natural law did involve
the engagement of a person s rationality with god s eternal law in a way
that enabled their virtue and flourishing

 it s not simply externally
imposed and there is a degree of flexibility in the application of the
primary precepts and use of the double effect



perhaps freud s critique only really works against approaches to the
conscience like augustine s where it simply involves an external
imposition of god s law



possible exam questions for conscience

easy
critically compare aquinas and freud s view of the conscience
are the workings of god present in the conscience



medium
 freud makes more sense of the concept of guilt than aquinas – discuss


does a theological approach to conscience work better than a
psychological approach


critically compare aquinas and freud s views on the process of moral
decisionmaking



hard
does conscience exist at all or is it an umbrella term for culture
environment genetics and education


is conscience merely an umbrella term for the psychological factors
involved in moral decision making


critically assess freud s psychosexual approach
