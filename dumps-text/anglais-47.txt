Examining the Role of Conscience in Making Moral Decisions

 [Examining the Role of Conscience in Making Moral Decisions]

[]

[]

Q: I disagree with some of the teachings of the Catholic Church. I was once told that I don’t have to follow all of the church’s teachings if they violate my conscience. But still, I’m not sure that’s right.

A: First, I want to commend you for asking this question. The fact that
you were moved to ask demonstrates two things: that God’s grace can be
operative in every person who is open to him, and secondly that you are
sincere in your desire to do God’s will.

I have run into a number of people in a similar predicament as you. They
asked someone who ought to be able to give some guidance on what was a
difficult moral question. In response, they seemed to get an answer that
indicated that, in the end, they had to just “follow their conscience.”

I can understand this. In the course of my life as a priest, I have
(like all of my brother priests) been asked to weigh in on life
situations in which there were no easy or obvious answers. At times,
after going through all of the tools and resources the church offers for
right decision-making, the right way to go remained foggy and difficult.

  “When he listens to his conscience, the prudent man can hear God
  speaking” —CCC 1777

In addition, the Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches: “When he
listens to his conscience, the prudent man can hear God speaking” (CCC
1777). Because of this line and others that highlight the importance of
conscience, it is tempting to take the default position of “whatever you
feel is right, just do that.”

I am not denying this. After all, this is clearly part of the catechism.
(I’m not about to go toe-to-toe with the catechism and think that I can
win! I’m not that smart.) But it misses crucial pieces of information.

First, while it is essential that we are sincere in the decisions we
make, we don’t only have an obligation to ourselves. This is something
that we have lost in our culture.

We think that “to thine own self be true” is the highest commandment. It
isn’t. While it is good to be truthful and interiorly at peace, we also
must be true to others. It’s even more essential that we are true to
God. We may have an obligation to strive for authenticity, but we also
have an obligation to obey God. I am not the only one to whom I must be
true.

Second, the church’s teaching on conscience presumes knowledge of the
moral law. This means that those who are exercising conscience know that
there is a real right and a real wrong. Unfortunately, there are fewer
people who acknowledge this reality. This places us in a unique place in
human history.

  We may have an obligation to strive for authenticity, but we also have
  an obligation to obey God.

A recent study reported that only 8 percent of American teenagers
believe in a real right and a real wrong. This ignorance is
unprecedented. Notre Dame sociologist Christian Smith recently concluded
a nationwide study on the moral life of 18- to 29-year-olds. His
conclusion was that this age group, generally speaking, has neither the
vocabulary nor the categories to make moral decisions. If conscience
depends on principles of right and wrong, how will these young people
make decisions? According to Smith, they base their decisions on
feelings.

But conscience is not a feeling. The catechism clearly states that
conscience “formulates its judgments according to reason, in conformity
with the true good willed by the wisdom of the Creator” (CCC 1783). This
means employing one’s mind more than one’s emotions to make decisions.
Conscience is not merely some feeling we get; it is the critical
application of truth to the present issue.

Third, it is true that, a person “must not be forced to act contrary to
his conscience. Nor must he be prevented from acting according to his
conscience, especially in religious matters” (CCC 1782). But this does
not mean doing whatever pleases me.

Let’s take a potentially explosive issue. When Pope Paul VI reinforced
the church’s constant teaching against artificial birth control in the
document “Humanae Vitae,” many couples were encouraged to dismiss this
teaching if it “violated their conscience.” Unfortunately, as a result,
many couples were obliquely encouraged to invite a sinful practice into
their sexual relationship. Even more, they were led to believe that they
could dismiss virtually any official and binding church teaching if they
disliked it.

Because that is all this comes down to. The church’s teaching on
contraception does not “violate” a person’s conscience. Unless a person
truly believed that periodic abstinence in marriage was an evil (which
is all that is being asked for through natural family planning), then
there is no conscience issue here. It is an issue of a) not knowing or
understanding the church’s teaching (which could be remedied by asking
someone who knows), b) lacking the will to choose the good (which is
always an issue for every person striving to live virtuously, but not a
good reason to choose sin over virtue), or c) a matter of personal
dislike for a particular teaching or the church in general.

  Seek to do his will above absolutely all else. Even in very difficult
  circumstances, God can be trusted.

After all of this, if we still have reasonable doubt regarding what to
do, we ought to do the following. First, pray. Second, it is wise to
examine your conscience regularly. Third, choose to do good. Fourth,
seek wise and holy counsel from someone who is not only educated in the
area of morality but who personally defers to the wisdom of Christ and
his church in all things. Lastly, trust God. He comes to our aid in
times of weakness and confusion. Seek to do his will above absolutely
all else. Even in very difficult circumstances, God can be trusted.
