Article 6 Moral Conscience

   MORAL CONSCIENCE

   1776 "Deep within his conscience man discovers a law which he has not
   laid upon himself but which he must obey. Its voice, ever calling him
   to love and to do what is good and to avoid evil, sounds in his heart
   at the right moment.... For man has in his heart a law inscribed by
   God.... His conscience is man's most secret core and his sanctuary.
   There he is alone with God whose voice echoes in his depths."^47
