moral conscience

from the catechism of the catholic church simplified

 prev next 

an inner law 1776

deep within his conscience man discovers a law which he must obey
namely to do good and to avoid evil

 in his conscience man s most
secret core he is alone with god whose voice echoes within man



conscience judge of individual acts 17771779

moral conscience urges a person to do good and avoid evil

 it even
judges his particular choices past present and future and shows
god s authority

 the prudent man hears god speaking in his commandments



by conscience the person s reason judges the morality of his actions
past present or future

 in this judgment man sees god s law


conscience is a messenger of him who speaks to us behind a veil and
teaches us by his representatives

 conscience is the aboriginal vicar of
christ john cardinal newman



every person must have sufficient interior awareness so he can hear and
follow his conscience

 turn inward brethren and in everything you do
see god as your witness st

 augustine



an upright conscience assumes responsibility 17801782

human dignity requires an upright conscience which knows moral
principles and applies them in each circumstance

 truth is recognized by
prudent judgments

 whoever follows his conscience is indeed prudent



by conscience a person assumes responsibility

 even in evil deeds
conscience remains an inner witness to truth that the choice was evil


this true judgment makes clear that the person must seek forgiveness and
choose good in the future

 whenever our hearts condemn us we reassure
ourselves that god is greater than our hearts and he knows everything
1 jn 31920



man has a right to make his own moral decisions

 he cannot be forced to
act contrary to his conscience nor be prevented from acting according
to his conscience especially in religious matters



man s duty to have a right conscience 17831785

the person has a duty to have a true conscience which is formed by
reason and seeks to know god s will

 only the educating of conscience
can overcome negative influences and temptations



this lifelong task begins with awakening the child to know and practice
god s law

 a prudent education teaches virtues cures selfishness and
guarantees peace of heart



the word of god guides this education

 man must examine his conscience
before the cross seek the advice of others and learn the church s
authoritative teaching



difficulties in judging 17861789

conscience can make a right judgment in accord with god s law and
reason or an erroneous judgment not in accord



in some situations moral judgments are difficult

 however in every
case the person must seek god s will in accord with his law



the person must interpret the data assisted by his own prudence
competent advice and the help of the holy spirit



in all cases evil can never be done so good can result

 whatever you
wish that men would do to you do so to them mt 712

 do nothing
that makes your brother stumble rom 1421



sources of errors in judgment 17901792

although a person must always obey the certain judgments of his
conscience he might be in ignorance and make erroneous judgments



sometimes the person is to blame for having an erroneous conscience
because he took no effort to discover the truth

 in this case he is
responsible for the evil he commits



there are several sources of these errors in judgment ignorance of
christ and of his gospel bad example from others enslavement to
passions lack of conversion of heart and rejection of the church s
teaching



unable to overcome 17931794

sometimes the person is not responsible for his erroneous judgment
because he cannot overcome the obstacles to truth

 this is called
invincible ignorance

 although evil is present the person is not
blameworthy

 he should work to correct his errors



conscience must be enlightened by faith so that persons and groups will
turn aside from blind choices
