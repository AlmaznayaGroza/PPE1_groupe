   conscience, a personal sense of the moral content of one’s own conduct,
   intentions, or character with regard to a feeling of obligation to do
   right or be good. Conscience, usually informed by acculturation and
   instruction, is thus generally understood to give intuitively
   authoritative judgments regarding the moral quality of single actions.

   Historically, almost every culture has recognized the existence of such
   a faculty. Ancient Egyptians, for example, were urged not to transgress
   against the dictates of the heart, for one “must stand in fear of
   departing from its guidance.” In some belief systems, conscience is
   regarded as the voice of God and therefore a completely reliable guide
   of conduct: among the Hindus it is considered “the invisible God who
   dwells within us.” Among Western religious groups, the Society of
   Friends (or Quakers) places particular emphasis on the role of
   conscience in apprehending and responding through conduct to the “Inner
   Light” of God.

   Outside the context of religion, philosophers, social scientists, and
   psychologists have sought to understand conscience in both its
   individual and universal aspects. The view that holds conscience to be
   an innate, intuitive faculty determining the perception of right and
   wrong is called intuitionism. The view that holds conscience to be a
   cumulative and subjective inference from past experience giving
   direction to future conduct is called empiricism. The behavioral
   scientist, on the other hand, may view the conscience as a set of
   learned responses to particular social stimuli. Another explanation of
   conscience was put forth in the 20th century by Sigmund Freud in his
   postulation of the superego. According to Freud, the superego is a
   major element of personality that is formed by the child’s
   incorporation of moral values through parental approval or punishment.
   The resulting internalized set of prohibitions, condemnations, and
   inhibitions is that part of the superego known as conscience.
