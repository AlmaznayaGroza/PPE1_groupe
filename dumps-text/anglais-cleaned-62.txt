levels of consciousness decoded

when documenting your patient s level of consciousness you ll notice
you have a lot of options to choose from

 your patient can be alert
confused in a coma and anything in between

 knowing the difference
between each level of consciousness will help you chart accurately and
communicate your patient s condition with precision

 the different
levels of consciousness are

 alert awake and responsive
 confused note that confusion can occur anywhere along this spectrum
 and is not always present prior to the patient becoming somnolent
 lethargic etc it is possible to have a patient who is somnolent or
 even lethargic and still oriented


 somnolent sleepy
 lethargic very drowsy falls asleep in between care
 obtunded difficult to arouse
 stuporous very difficult to arouse
 unresponsivecoma unarousable

describing your patient s loc correctly is especially important when
there are acute changes in condition

 for example i had a patient
recently who was stuporous upon arrival to the icu but quickly became
unresponsive requiring immediate intervention in order to keep the
patient safe

 had i not known how to describe this patient s level of
consciousness using standardized language there could have been a huge
miscommunication between me and the md

 so let s go through a quick
example using an entirely fictitious patient

 ready





in report you learn the following about your patient 56 year old female
with ckd stage 4 chf dm2 and hyperlipidemia

 biba yesterday for sob
currently on 6l oxygen

 bp 11068 hr 77 o2 sat 94 afebrile

 urine
output minimal overnight at 20 mlhr dark and concentrated

 chemistry
panel shows mild hyperkalemia elevated bun and creatinine mildly
anemic with hbg 9

2 and wbc wdl



at the time of your initial assessment at 0800 you note that the
patient opens her eyes spontaneously and responds to questions though
not all her answers make sense

 she will follow simple onestep
commands but when you ask her to do more than one thing at a time she
does not always follow through

 you ask your patient where she is right
now and she answers “in my living room

” at this time your patient is
alert and confused



at 0900 you bring in your patient s medications

 she wakes easily to
voice but yawns a few times and states she just wants to sleep

 at this
point your patient is somnolent



at 1000  you go in to help your patient get repositioned when you
notice she opens eyes only to voice or stimulation not spontaneously 


she follows some basic commands and is slow to respond

 she drifts off
again once no longer stimulated

 your patient is now lethargic



at 1200 your patient is more difficult to arouse

 her responses are
delayed and minimal

 she does not appear to fully wake when stimulated
and she immediately goes back to sleep when not stimulated

 when she
does answer questions she mumbles and is clearly confused

 at this time
she is obtunded



by 1300 your patient can only be aroused by vigorous and repeated
stimulation

 when the stimulation stops she immediately lapses back into
her unresponsive state

 the only vocalizations she makes are moans

 she
is now in a stupor



at 1400 your patient is unarousable to any stimulation even vigorous
and painful stimuli

 at this point she is unresponsive or comatose



of course you ve been updating the md on your patient s changes in loc
all morning and you have both ensured that the appropriate
interventions have been instituted

 in a case with patient with renal
disease you will often see them have decreasing levels of consciousness
as their ph drops secondary to their metabolic acidosis

 with a patient
like this you might anticipate the md ordering an abg at some
pointdon t be surprised if it comes back acidotic

 typically what
happens is the patient will receive dialysis and as things start to come
back into balance the patient becomes more alert assuming they don t
have any other underlying physiologic derangements such as sepsis



the other common situation this occurs in is copd exacerbation

 the ph
will decrease as the co2 increases

 as the co2 rises the patient
becomes more and more comatoseusually we can pull the patient out of it
with bipap but in extreme cases they may be intubated

 you ll see this
over and over and over againespecially if you work in a medical icu or
telemetry unit



this whole topic of consciousness is so incredibly interesting
especially as it relates to anesthesia

 if you re interested in getting
your crna someday you might find this article fascinatingi know i
certainly did
