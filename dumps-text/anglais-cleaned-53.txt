collective consciousness collective conscience or collective conscious
french conscience collective is the set of shared beliefs ideas and
moral attitudes which operate as a unifying force within society

1
in general it does not refer to the specifically moral conscience but
to a shared understanding of social norms

2

the modern concept of what can be considered collective consciousness
includes solidarity attitudes memes extreme behaviors like groupthink
and herd behavior and collectively shared experiences during collective
rituals dance parties3 and the discarnate entities which can be
experienced from psychedelic use

4 rather than existing as separate
individuals people come together as dynamic groups to share resources
and knowledge

 it has also developed as a way of describing how an
entire community comes together to share similar values

 this has also
been termed hive mind group mind mass mind and social
mind

5

historical use of collective consciousness

edit

the term was introduced by the french sociologist émile durkheim in his
the division of labour in society in 1893

 the french word conscience
generally means conscience consciousness awareness6 or
perception

7 given the multiplicity of definitions translators
of durkheim disagree on which is most appropriate or whether the
translation should depend on the context

 some prefer to treat the word
 conscience as an untranslatable foreign word or technical term
without its normal english meaning

8 as for collective durkheim
makes clear that he is not reifying or hypostasizing this concept for
him it is collective simply in the sense that it is common to many
individuals9 cf

 social fact



scipio sighele published la foule criminele one year before durkheim
in which he describes emergent characteristics of crowds that don t
appear in the individuals that form the crowd

 he doesn t call this
collective consciousness but âme de la foule soul of the
crowd

10 this term returns in sigmund freud s book about mass
psychology and essentially overlaps with durkheims concept of collective
consciousness



theories of collective consciousness

edit

durkheim

edit

durkheim used the term in his books the division of labour in society
1893 the rules of the sociological method 1895 suicide 1897 and
the elementary forms of religious life 1912

 in the division of
labour durkheim argued that in traditionalprimitive societies those
based around clan family or tribal relationships totemic religion
played an important role in uniting members through the creation of a
common consciousness

 in societies of this type the contents of an
individual s consciousness are largely shared in common with all other
members of their society creating a mechanical solidarity through
mutual likeness



 the totality of beliefs and sentiments common to the average members
 of a society forms a determinate system with a life of its own

 it can
 be termed the collective or common consciousness



 — émile durkheim11

in suicide durkheim developed the concept of anomie to refer to the
social rather than individual causes of suicide

 this relates to the
concept of collective consciousness as if there is a lack of
integration or solidarity in society then suicide rates will be
higher

12

gramsci

edit

antonio gramsci states “a collective consciousness which is to say a
living organism is formed only after the unification of the
multiplicity through friction on the part of the individuals nor can
one say that silence is not a multiplicity

”13 a form of
collective consciousness can be formed from gramsci s conception that
the presence of a hegemony can mobilize the collective consciousness of
those oppressed by the ruling ideas of society or the ruling hegemony


collective consciousness can refer to a multitude of different
individual forms of consciousness coalescing into a greater whole

 in
gramsci s view a unified whole is composed of solidarity among its
different constituent parts and therefore this whole cannot be
uniformly the same

 the unified whole can embrace different forms of
consciousness or individual experiences of social reality which
coexist to reflect the different experiences of the marginalized peoples
in a given society

 this agrees with gramsci s theory of marxism and
class struggle applied to cultural contexts

 cultural marxism as
distinguished from the rightwing use of the term embodies the concept
of collective consciousness

 it incorporates social movements that are
based on some sort of collective identity these identities can include
for instance gender sexual orientation race and ability and can be
incorporated by collectivebased movements into a broader historical
material analysis of class struggle



according to michelle filippini “the nature and workings of collective
organisms – not only parties but also trade unions associations and
intermediate bodies in general – represent a specific sphere of
reflection in the prison notebooks particularly in regard to the new
relationship between state and society that in gramsci s view emerged
during the age of mass politics

”14 collective organisms can
express collective consciousness

 whether this form of expression finds
itself in the realm of the state or the realm of society is up to the
direction that the subjects take in expressing their collective
consciousness

 in gramsci s prison notebooks the ongoing conflict
between civil society the bureaucracy and the state necessitates the
emergence of a collective consciousness that can often act as an
intermediary between these different realms

 the public organizations of
protest such as labor unions and antiwar organizations are vehicles
that can unite multiple types of collective consciousness

 although
identitybased movements are necessary for the progress of democracy and
can generate collective consciousness they cannot completely do so
without a unifying framework

 this is why antiwar and labor movements
provide an avenue that has united various social movements under the
banner of a multiple collective consciousness

 this is also why future
social movements need to have an ethos of collective consciousness if
they are to succeed in the longterm



zukerfield

edit

zukerfield states that “the different disciplines that have studied
knowledge share an understanding of it as a product of human subjects –
individual collective etc

”15 knowledge in a sociological sense
is derived from social conditions and social realities

 collective
consciousness also reflects social realities and sociological knowledge
can be gained through the adoption of a collective consciousness

 many
different disciplines such as philosophy and literature examine
collective consciousness from different lenses

 these different
disciplines reach a similar understanding of a collective consciousness
despite their different approaches to the subject

 the inherent
humanness in the idea of collective consciousness refers to a shared way
of thinking among human beings in the pursuit of knowledge



collective consciousness can provide an understanding of the
relationship between self and society

 as zukerfeld states “even though
it impels us as a first customary gesture to analyse the subjective
such as individual consciousness or intersubjective bearers such as
the values of a given society in other words those which marxism and
sociology examine now we can approach them in an entirely different
light

”16 “cognitive materialism”15 is presented in the work
by zukerfeld as a sort of third way between sociological knowledge and
marxism

 cognitive materialism is based on a kind of collective
consciousness of the mind

 this consciousness can be used with
cognitive materialism as a guiding force by human beings in order to
critically analyze society and social conditions



collective consciousness in society

edit

society is made up of various collective groups such as the family
community organizations regions nations which as burns and egdahl
state can be considered to possess agential capabilities to think
judge decide act reform to conceptualize self and others as well as
self s actions and interactions and to reflect



17 it is
suggested that these different national behaviors vary according to the
different collective consciousness between nations

 this illustrates
that differences in collective consciousness can have practical
significance



according to a theory the character of collective consciousness depends
on the type of mnemonic encoding used within a group tsoukalas 2007


the specific type of encoding used has a predictable influence on the
group s behavior and collective ideology

 informal groups that meet
infrequently and spontaneously have a tendency to represent significant
aspects of their community as episodic memories

 this usually leads to
strong social cohesion and solidarity an indulgent atmosphere an
exclusive ethos and a restriction of social networks

 formal groups
that have scheduled and anonymous meetings tend to represent
significant aspects of their community as semantic memories which
usually leads to weak social cohesion and solidarity a more moderate
atmosphere an inclusive ethos and an expansion of social
networks

18

literary and oral tradition

edit

in a case study of a serbian folk story wolfgang ernst examines
collective consciousness in terms of forms of media specifically
collective oral and literary traditions

 current discourse analysis
drifts away from the culturalist turn of the last two or three decades
and its concern with individual and collective memory as an extended
target of historical research

19 there is still a collective
consciousness present in terms of the shared appreciation of folk
stories and oral traditions

 folk stories enable the subject and the
audiences to come together around a common experience and a shared
heritage

 in the case of the serbian folk “gusle”20 the serbian
people take pride in this musical instrument of epic poetry and oral
tradition and play it at social gatherings

 expressions of art and
culture are expressions of a collective consciousness or expressions of
multiple social realities
