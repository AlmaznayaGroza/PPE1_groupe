In Marxism, class consciousness is the set of beliefs that persons hold
regarding their social class or economic rank in society, the structure
of their class, and their common class interests.^([1][2]) According to
Karl Marx, class consciousness is an awareness that is key to sparking a
revolution which would "create a dictatorship of the proletariat,
transforming it from a wage-earning, propertyless mass into the ruling
class".^([3])

Although Marxists tend to focus on class consciousness (or its absence)
among the proletariat, the upper classes in society can also think and
act in a class-conscious way. As Leonard Fein pointed out, "The very
rich have been well aware of their class privilege and have labored
mightily to protect and defend it".^([4][5]) For example, Warren Buffett
has demonstrated class consciousness: "There's class warfare, all
right... but it's my class, the rich class, that's making war, and we're
winning."^([6])

Marxist theory

[edit]

Early in the 19th century, the labels "working classes" and "middle
classes" were coming into common usage in British society. David Cody
writes about this time period: "The old hereditary aristocracy,
reinforced by the new gentry who owed their success to commerce,
industry, and the professions, evolved into an 'upper class' (its
consciousness formed in large part by the Public Schools and
Universities) which tenaciously maintained control over the political
system, depriving not only the working classes but the middle classes of
a voice in the political process."^([7]) As the Industrial Revolution
progressed, the sharpening of socioeconomic divisions caused each group
to become more acutely conscious of its position in the hierarchy.^([7])

While Karl Marx rarely used the term "class consciousness", he did make
the distinction between "class in itself", which is defined as a stratum
of society sharing common grievances and a unified perspective; and a
"class for itself", which is defined as a stratum organized in active
pursuit of its own interests.^([8])

Categorizing a person's social class can be a determinant for their
awareness of it. Marxists categorize classes based on their relation to
the means of production, especially on whether or not members of the
class own capital. Non-Marxists differentiate society's various groups
based on social stratification, i.e., income, race, gender, ethnicity,
education, occupation, or status.^([9][10][11])

Whereas Marx believed the working class would gain class consciousness
as a result of its experience of exploitation, later orthodox Marxism,
in particular as formulated by Vladimir Lenin, argued that the working
class, by itself, could only develop "trade union consciousness", which
Lenin characterized in What Is to Be Done? as "the conviction that it is
necessary to combine in unions, fight the employers, and strive to
compel the government to pass necessary labour legislation."^([12]) To
overcome this (in Lenin's opinion) limited worldview, a vanguard party
of the most politically advanced section of the working class was needed
to help replace trade union consciousness with class
consciousness.^([13][14])

Criticism

[edit]

The Polish political philosopher Leszek Kolakowski disputed the notion
that class consciousness could be instilled from outside by a vanguard
party. In Main Currents of Marxism and his other writings, he stated
that in order to achieve a unity of theory and praxis, theory must not
only tend toward reality in an attempt to change it; reality must also
tend towards theory. Otherwise, the historical process leads a life of
its own, while theorists make their own little theories, desperately
waiting for some kind of possible influence over the historical process.
Henceforth, reality itself must tend toward the theory, making it the
"expression of the revolutionary process itself". In turn, a theory
which has as its goal helping the proletariat achieve class
consciousness must first be an "objective theory of class
consciousness". However, theory in itself is insufficient, and
ultimately relies on the struggle of humankind and of the proletariat
for consciousness: the "objective theory of class consciousness is only
the theory of its objective possibility".^([15][16])

Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises asserted that "Marx
confus[ed] the notions of caste and class". Mises allowed that class
consciousness and the associated class struggle were valid concepts in
some circumstances where rigid social castes exist, e.g., when slavery
is legal and slaves have a common motive for wanting to end their
disadvantaged status relative to other castes, but that class is an
arbitrary distinction in capitalist society where there is equality
before the law. Mises believed that under capitalism, one's wealth does
not very much affect how one is treated by legislators, law enforcement,
or the courts.^([17])

Mises' follower Murray Rothbard argued that Marx's effort to portray
workers and capitalists as two monolithic groups was false because
workers and capitalists routinely compete within themselves, such as
capitalist entrepreneurs competing with each other for market dominance,
or native workers competing with immigrant workers for jobs. Rothbard
said that if there is constant conflict among members of the same class
(like, for example, among landowners, nobility or slaveowners), then it
is absurd to claim these landowners, nobles and slaveowners can also
have shared objective interests with one another against a different
class such as their workers, peasants or slaves.^([18])

16. ^ 'Marxism, being a scientific theory, could not be a spontaneous
    product of the working class [according to Lenin], but had to be
    imported from outside, by intellectuals equipped with scientific
    knowledge, became the peculiar ideological instrument to justify a
    new idea of the party of manipulators. Since the working class is in
    principle incapable of articulating theoretically its consciousness,
    it is possible and even necessary that the "genuine" theoretical
    consciousness of the working class should be incarnated in a
    political organism that could consider itself the carrier of this
    consciousness regardless of what the "empirical" working class
    thought about it, given that the "empirical" consciousness of this
    class is irrelevant in defining who in a given moment represents its
    interest. This is why the theory of class consciousness instilled
    from outside and the whole idea of scientific socialism so conceived
    served to justify the fact that in all kinds of political activity
    and later in the exercise of political power, the working class may
    be and must be replaced by the political apparatus which is the
    vehicle of its consciousness at the highest level. The whole
    Leninist and then Stalinist principle of dictatorship which the
    proletariat exercises through the intermediary of its self-appointed
    representatives, is only a development of the idea of "scientific
    socialism" so conceived.' Leszek Kolakowski, "Althusser's Marx", The
