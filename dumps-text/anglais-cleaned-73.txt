nietzsche on bad conscience

5 june 2020

a portrait of friedrich nietzsche drawn in 1905 by edvard munch



friedrich nietzsche 5 october 1844 – 25 august 1900 was mostly known
for his philosophy

 from reading nietzsche s philosophy though one can
sense a breadth of interests language history poetry culture


yet something consistent connects them at great lengths he explores the
psychology of existence

 in particular he was interested in our
relationship with suffering


we have a need to find suffering meaningful nietzsche thought creating
purpose in a continuous process of interpretation and reinterpretation


thus spoke nietzsche hehe in on the genealogy of morality we tend to
live under creditordebtor relationships

 there are higher creditors
god society etc

 and we the debtors favour the foretaste of
their higher status


in these relationships we feel existential guilt e

g

 from sins 
using goods and services etc

 and embrace—even enjoy—the suffering
e

g

 through punishment discipline tradition sacrifice sexual
deprivation 


however this psychological instinct has a way of turning itself inward
 the internalizing of man what he later calls his soul

 nietzsche was
not a fan such maltreatment belongs to desperate prisoners filled
with longing and without bodily instinct



 i take bad conscience to be the deep sickness into which man had to
fall under the pressure of the most fundamental of all changes he ever
experienced—the change of finding himself enclosed once and for all
within the sway of society and peace

 just as water animals must have
fared when they were forced either to become land animals or to perish
so fared these half animals who were happily adapted to wilderness war
roaming about adventure—all at once all their instincts were devalued
and disconnected

 

in nietzsche s nihilism there are no absolute values we inherit values
from social institutions who enforce adherence for their own power

 but
when these values stop servicing our lives we should learn as
individuals to renounce those collective values and create new ones
which service us once more


nietzsche s worldview continues to resonate with many people especially
the angsty

 go ahead and see type nihilism into a social media
platform s search bar and see what comes up


however there is no doubt that nietzsche constructed a lifeaffirming
philosophy which sought to elicit individual spirit
