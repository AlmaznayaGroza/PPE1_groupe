collective consciousness sometimes collective conscience or conscious
is a fundamental sociological concept that refers to the set of shared
beliefs ideas attitudes and knowledge that are common to a social
group or society

 the collective consciousness informs our sense of
belonging and identity and our behavior

 founding sociologist émile
durkheim developed this concept to explain how unique individuals are
bound together into collective units like social groups and societies



 how collective consciousness holds society together 

what is it that holds society together

 this was the central question
that preoccupied durkheim as he wrote about the new industrial societies
of the 19th century

 by considering the documented habits customs and
beliefs of traditional and primitive societies and comparing those to
what he saw around him in his own life durkheim crafted some of the
most important theories in sociology

 he concluded that society exists
because unique individuals feel a sense of solidarity with each other


this is why we can form collectives and work together to achieve
community and functional societies

 the collective consciousness
or conscience collective as he wrote it in french is the source of this
solidarity



durkheim first introduced his theory of the collective consciousness in
his 1893 book the division of labor in society

 later he would also
rely on the concept in other books including rules of the sociological
method suicide and the elementary forms of religious life

 in
this text he explains that the phenomenon is the totality of beliefs
and sentiments common to the average members of a society

 durkheim
observed that in traditional or primitive societies religious symbols
discourse beliefs and rituals fostered the collective consciousness


in such cases where social groups were quite homogenous not distinct
by race or class for example the collective consciousness resulted in
what durkheim termed a mechanical solidarity — in effect an automatic
binding together of people into a collective through their shared
values beliefs and practices



durkheim observed that in the modern industrialized societies that
characterized western europe and the young united states when he wrote
which functioned via a division of labor an organic solidarity
emerged based on the mutual reliance individuals and groups had on
others in order to allow for a society to function

 in cases such as
these religion still played an important role in producing collective
consciousness among groups of people affiliated with various religions
but other social institutions and structures would also work to produce
the collective consciousness necessary for this more complex form of
solidarity and rituals outside of religion would play important roles
in reaffirming it



 social institutions produce collective consciousness 

these other institutions include the state which fosters patriotism and
nationalism news and popular media which spreads all kinds of ideas
and practices from how to dress to who to vote for to how to date and
be married education which molds us into compliant citizens and
workers and the police and judiciary which shape our notions of right
and wrong and direct our behavior through threat of or actual physical
force among others

 rituals that serve to reaffirm the collective
conscious range from parades and holiday celebrations to sporting
events weddings grooming ourselves according to gender norms and even
shopping think black friday



in either case — primitive or modern societies — collective
consciousness is something common to the whole of society as durkheim
put it

 it is not an individual condition or phenomenon but a social
one

 as a social phenomenon it is diffused across society as a whole
and has a life of its own

 it is through collective consciousness that
values beliefs and traditions can be passed down through generations


though individual people live and die this collection of intangible
things including the social norms connected to them are cemented in
our social institutions and thus exist independent of individual people



most important to understand is that collective consciousness is the
result of social forces that are external to the individual that course
through society and that work together to create the social phenomenon
of the shared set of beliefs values and ideas that compose it

 we as
individuals internalize these and make the collective consciousness a
reality by doing so and we reaffirm and reproduce it by living in ways
that reflect it
