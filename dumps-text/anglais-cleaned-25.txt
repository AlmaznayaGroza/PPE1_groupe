conscience a personal sense of the moral content of one s own conduct
intentions or character with regard to a feeling of obligation to do
right or be good

 conscience usually informed by acculturation and
instruction is thus generally understood to give intuitively
authoritative judgments regarding the moral quality of single actions



historically almost every culture has recognized the existence of such
a faculty

 ancient egyptians for example were urged not to transgress
against the dictates of the heart for one “must stand in fear of
departing from its guidance

” in some belief systems conscience is
regarded as the voice of god and therefore a completely reliable guide
of conduct among the hindus it is considered “the invisible god who
dwells within us

” among western religious groups the society of
friends or quakers places particular emphasis on the role of
conscience in apprehending and responding through conduct to the “inner
light” of god



outside the context of religion philosophers social scientists and
psychologists have sought to understand conscience in both its
individual and universal aspects

 the view that holds conscience to be
an innate intuitive faculty determining the perception of right and
wrong is called intuitionism

 the view that holds conscience to be a
cumulative and subjective inference from past experience giving
direction to future conduct is called empiricism

 the behavioral
scientist on the other hand may view the conscience as a set of
learned responses to particular social stimuli

 another explanation of
conscience was put forth in the 20th century by sigmund freud in his
postulation of the superego

 according to freud the superego is a major
element of personality that is formed by the child s incorporation of
moral values through parental approval or punishment

 the resulting
internalized set of prohibitions condemnations and inhibitions is that
part of the superego known as conscience
