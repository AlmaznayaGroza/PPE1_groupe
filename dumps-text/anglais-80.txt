   The word consciousness is used in a variety of ways that need to be
   distinguished. Sometimes the word means merely any human mental
   activity at all (as when one talks about the “history of
   consciousness”), and sometimes it means merely being awake (as in As
   the anesthetic wore off, the animal regained consciousness). The most
   philosophically troublesome usage concerns phenomena with which people
   seem to be “directly acquainted”—as the British philosopher Bertrand
   Russell (1872–1970) described them—each in his own case. Each person
   seems to have direct, immediate knowledge of his own conscious
   sensations and of the contents of his propositional attitudes—what he
   consciously thinks, believes, desires, hopes, fears, and so on. In
   common philosophical parlance, a person is said to have “incorrigible”
   (or uncorrectable) access to his own mental states. For many people,
   the existence of these conscious states in their own case is more
   obvious and undeniable than anything else in the world. Indeed, the
   French mathematician and philosopher René Descartes (1596–1650)
   regarded his immediate conscious thoughts as the basis of all of the
   rest of his knowledge. Views that emphasize this first-person immediacy
   of conscious states have consequently come to be called “Cartesian.”

   It turns out to be surprisingly difficult to say much about
   consciousness that is not highly controversial. Initial efforts in the
   19th century to approach psychology with the rigour of other
   experimental sciences led researchers to engage in careful
   introspection of their own mental states. Although there emerged some
   interesting results regarding the relation of certain sensory states to
   external stimulation—for example, laws proposed by Gustav Theodor
   Fechner (1801–87) that relate the apparent to the real amplitude of a
   sound—much of the research dissolved into vagaries and complexities of
   experience that varied greatly over different individuals and about
   which interesting generalizations were not forthcoming.

   It is worth pausing over some of the difficulties of introspection and
   the consequent pitfalls of thinking of conscious processes as the
   central subject matter of psychology. While it can seem natural to
   think that all mental phenomena are accessible to consciousness, close
   attention to the full range of cases suggests otherwise. The
   Austrian-born British philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951) was
   particularly adept at calling attention to the rich and subtle variety
   of ordinary mental states and to how little they lend themselves to the
   model of an introspectively observed object. In a typical passage from
   his later writings (Zettel, §§484–504), he asked:

     Is it hair-splitting to say: —joy, enjoyment, delight, are not
     sensations? —Let us at least ask ourselves: How much analogy is
     there between delight and what we call “sensation”? “I feel great
     joy” —Where? —that sounds like nonsense. And yet one does say “I
     feel a joyful agitation in my breast.” —But why is joy not
     localized? Is it because it is distributed over the whole body? …
     Love is not a feeling. Love is put to the test, pain not. One does
     not say: “That was not true pain, or it would not have gone off so
     quickly.”

   In a related vein, the American linguist Ray Jackendoff proposed that
   one is never directly conscious of abstract ideas, such as goodness and
   justice—they are not items in the stream of consciousness. At best, one
   is aware of the perceptual qualities one might associate with such
   ideas—for example, an image of someone acting in a kindly way. While it
   can seem that there is something right in such suggestions, it also
   seems to be immensely difficult to determine exactly what the truth
   might be on the basis of introspection alone.

   In the late 20th century, the validity and reliability of introspection
   were subject to much experimental study. In an influential review of
   the literature on “self-attribution,” the American psychologists
   Richard Nisbett and Timothy Wilson discussed a wide range of
   experiments that showed that people are often demonstrably mistaken
   about their own psychological processes. For example, in
   problem-solving tasks, people are often sensitive to crucial clues of
   which they are quite unaware, and they often provide patently
   confabulated accounts of the problem-solving methods they actually
   employ. Nisbett and Wilson speculated that in many cases introspection
   may not involve privileged access to one’s own mental states but rather
   the imposition upon oneself of popular theories about what mental
   states a person in one’s situation is likely to have. This possibility
   should be considered seriously when evaluating many of the traditional
   claims about the alleged incorrigibility of people’s access to their
   own minds.

   In any event, it is important to note that not all mental phenomena are
   conscious. Indeed, the existence of unconscious mental states has been
   recognized in the West since the time of the ancient Greeks. Obvious
   examples include the beliefs, long-range plans, and desires that a
   person is not consciously thinking about at a particular time, as well
   as things that have “slipped one’s mind,” though they must in some way
   still be there, since one can be reminded of them. Plato thought that
   the kinds of a priori reasoning typically used in mathematics and
   geometry involve the “recollection” (anamnesis) of temporarily
   forgotten thoughts from a previous life. Modern followers of Sigmund
   Freud (1856–1939) have argued that a great many ordinary parapraxes (or
   “Freudian slips”) are the result of deeply repressed unconscious
   thoughts and desires. And, as noted above, many experiments reveal
   myriad ways in which people are unaware of, and sometimes demonstrably
   mistaken about, the character of their mental processes, which are
   therefore unconscious at least at the time they occur.

   Partly out of frustration with introspectionism, psychologists during
   the first half of the 20th century tended to ignore consciousness
   entirely and instead study only “objective behaviour” (see below
   Radical behaviourism). In the last decades of the century,
   psychologists began to turn their attention once again to consciousness
   and introspection, but their methods differed radically from those of
   early introspectionists, in ways that can be understood against the
   background of other issues.

   One might wonder what makes an unconscious mental process “mental” at
   all. If a person does not have immediate knowledge of it, why is it not
   merely part of the purely physical machinery of the brain? Why bring in
   mentality at all? Accessibility to consciousness, however, is not the
   only criterion for determining whether a given state or process is
   mental. One alternative criterion is that mental states and processes
   enter into the rationality of the systems of which they are a part.
