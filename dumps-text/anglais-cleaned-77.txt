false consciousness is a term used to describe the way in which
exploited oppressed or disadvantaged groups in society accept
assimilate and indeed actively defend or promote ideas which ultimately
act against their own interests

 

it can apply to individuals to the working class as a whole or to
sections of it

 it is closely related to the idea of hegemony see qa
82 and to marxist concepts of alienation reification and fetishism
see qa 51



“false consciousness” often manifests itself as socalled “common
sense”

 examples include the notion that capitalism “private
enterprise” profit “the market” is simply how things are

 that those
who have power or earn more do so because they are brighter or work
harder than the rest of us that differences in opportunity or in the
social position of men and women are natural determined by their genes
that the status quo is simply just “the way the world works” and can t
be changed

  

false consciousness is related to the ever changing economic and social
base of capitalism

 marx and engels declared
“the ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas
ie the class which is the ruling material force of society is at the
same time its ruling intellectual force



“the class which has the means of material production at its disposal
has control at the same time over the means of mental production so
that thereby generally speaking the ideas of those who lack the means
of mental production are subject to it

 the ruling ideas are nothing
more than the ideal expression of the dominant material relationships
the dominant material relationships grasped as ideas hence of the
relationships which make the one class the ruling one therefore the
ideas of its dominance

”

marx and engels argued that false consciousness applies particularly in
regard to abstract ideas such as property rights “ie ideas which
increasingly take on the form of universality

 for each new class which
puts itself in the place of one ruling before it is compelled merely
in order to carry through its aim to represent its interest as the
common interest of all the members of society that is expressed in
ideal form it has to give its ideas the form of universality and
represent them as the only rational universally valid ones”

  

the term “false consciousness” was first used by engels who emphasised
that it was not simply a passive absorption of rulingclass ideas and
values but involves an active acquiescence in adopting and developing
those ideas “a process accomplished by the socalled thinker
consciously indeed but with a false consciousness”

  false
consciousness was an aspect of ideology but engels declared had been
neglected by marxists because of “the fatuous notion of the ideologists
that because we deny an independent historical development to the
various ideological spheres which play a part in history we also deny
them any effect upon history

”  

gramsci in the 1930s further developed the notion of false consciousness
as part of the political superstructure as a vehicle for delivering
capitalist hegemony – the dominant but changing set of cultural and
ideological norms which determine the boundaries of what can and cannot
be said without inviting ridicule or antagonism and which helps the
existing system to address its own contradictions adapt and survive

  

false consciousness is in part a consequence of the hegemony of
propaganda of the institutions of the capitalist state including
education and the media which encourages and for some individuals
rewards obedience submission and conformity

  

but it manifests itself – and is reinforced – in multiple ways in
everyday life

 it expresses itself for example in commodity fetishism
— the way relationships between people workers and owners are framed
as relationships between things money and products



commodity fetishism obscures the fact that relations between people and
products reflect relationships between people and that they can
therefore be changed

 

false consciousness reveals itself above all in conformity – how the
need to keep a job to pay the rent or mortgage feed the kids heat the
home enjoy the occasional luxury becomes seen as normal the natural
state of affairs whilst those who reap the rewards of your labour are
simply enjoying the rights of ownership



ultimately false consciousness legitimates the power of the ruling
class

 

marx and engels declared “in the last analysis the dominant ideas of a
society are the ideas of its ruling class” – legitimating a situation in
which one class has power

 as terry eagleton puts it ideology is “an
element in that complex structure of social perception which ensures
that the situation in which one social class has power over the others
is either seen by most members of the society as natural or not seen
at all

”   

but especially in its cultural aspects “ideology is never a simple
reflection of a ruling class s ideas on the contrary it is always a
complex phenomenon which may incorporate conflicting even
contradictory views of the world

”

engels for example declared that art is far richer and more
“opaque” than political and economic theory because it is less explicit
less purely ideological

 so challenging false consciousness is not
just a matter of political education and social argument

 as the
excellent culture pages in this paper show the battle is also important
in the cultural sphere

 

the literary critic ernst fischer declared that art can and that good
art always does transcend the ideological limits of its time “yielding
us insights into the realities”



false consciousness is the antithesis of class consciousness of the
development of a “class for itself”

 class consciousness involves
forging a counterculture which sees beyond the limitations of
capitalism

 

that task is vital where the contradictions of capitalism are most
apparent – in the workplace in our transport or energy supply systems
in the food chain in the climate crisis

 

but it is critical also in neighbourhoods in communities in everyday
life

  

in the decades following the collapse of “existing socialism” in the
soviet union and subsequently elsewhere not least for example in
yugoslavia which had a very different model of social organisation and
political engagement some on the left experienced selfdoubt

 

some even conceived that capitalism represented “the end of history” –
that selfinterest and exploitation was the inevitable state of
humanity

 

but socialism survived – and survives – not least in cuba in perhaps
the least propitious of circumstances due to the consciousness and
engagement of workers and communities in protecting the gains of their
revolution

 and socialist ideas continue to inspire struggles for social
justice and progress throughout the world

 

in britain too resistance to capitalism s escalating economic crisis
and public support for struggles over jobs pay conditions and the
social wage reflects a growing understanding that things can and must
change



central to marx s concept of historical materialism is the understanding
that it is not consciousness that determines people s existence but
their social existence that determines their consciousness

 

however the form that consciousness takes can vary

 as gawain little
pointed out in an article in this paper the hegemony exercised by
capital is in a constant process of being remade and reconfigured

 

as he argued “it is not enough to propose alternatives or even to
fight to win people to them

 we must change the very common sense  of
society enabling people to envision a future beyond capitalism

”  

that is probably the single biggest challenge facing all socialists
today
