Why
did
the
experience
of
consciousness
evolve
from
our
underlying
brain
physiology
?


Despite
being
a
vibrant
area
of
neuroscience
,
current
research
on
consciousness
is
characterised
by
disagreement
and
controversy
–
with
several
rival
theories
in
contention
.



A
recent
scoping
review
of
over
1
,000
articles
identified
over
20
different
theoretical
accounts
.


Philosophers
like
David
Chalmers
argue
that
no
single
scientific
theory
can
truly
explain
consciousness
.



We
define
consciousness
as
embodied
subjective
awareness
,
including
self
awareness
.


In
a
recent
article
published
in
Interalia
(which
is
not
peer
reviewed
)
,
we
argue
that
one
reason
for
this
predicament
is
the
powerful
role
played
by
intuition
.



We
are
not
alone
.


Social
scientist
Jacy
Reese
Anthis
writes
“much
of
the
debate
on
the
fundamental
nature
of
consciousness
takes
the
form
of
intuition
jousting
,
in
which
the
different
parties
each
report
their
own
strong
intuitions
and
joust
them
against
each
other”
.



Dangers
of
intuition

Key
intuitive
beliefs
–
for
example
that
our
mental
processes
are
distinct
from
our
physical
bodies
(mind-body
dualism
)
and
that
our
mental
processes
give
rise
to
and
control
our
decisions
and
actions

(mental
causation
)
–
are
supported
by
a
lifetime
of
subjective
experiences
.



These
beliefs
are
found
in
all
human
cultures
.


They
are
important
as
they
serve
as
foundational
beliefs
for
most
liberal
democracies
and
criminal
justice
systems
.


They
are
resistant
to
counter
evidence
.


That’s
because
they
are
powerfully
endorsed
by
social
and
cultural
concepts
such
as
free
will
,
human
rights
,
democracy
,
justice
and
moral
responsibility
.


All
these
concepts
assume
that
consciousness
plays
a
central
controlling
influence
.



Intuition
,
however
,
is
an
automatic
,
cognitive
process
that
evolved
to
provide
fast
trusted
explanations
and
predictions
.


In
fact
,
it
does
so
without
the
need
for
us
to
know
how
or
why
we
know
it
.


The
outcomes
of
intuition
therefore
shape
how
we
perceive
and
explain
our
everyday
world
without
the
need
for
extensive
reflection
or
formal
analytic
explanations
.



While
helpful
and
indeed
crucial
for
many
everyday
activities
,
intuitive
beliefs
can
be
wrong
.


They
can
also
interfere
with
scientific
literacy
.



Intuitive
accounts
of
consciousness
ultimately
put
us
in
the
driver’s
seat
as
“captain
of
our
own
ship”
.


We
think
we
know
what
consciousness
is
and
what
it
does
from
simply
experiencing
it
.


Mental
thoughts
,
intentions
and
desires
are
seen
as
determining
and
controlling
our
actions
.



The
widespread
acceptance
of
these
tacit
intuitive
accounts
helps
explain
,
in
part
,
why
the
formal
study
of
consciousness
was
relegated
to
the
margins
of
mainstream
neuroscience
until
late
20th
century
.



The
problem
for
scientific
models
of
consciousness
remains
accommodating
these
intuitive
accounts
within
a
materialist
framework
consistent
with
the
findings
of
neuroscience
.


While
there
is
no
current
scientific
explanation
for
how
brain
tissue
generates
or
maintains
subjective
experience
,
the
consensus
among
(most
)
neuroscientists
is
that
it
is
a
product
of
brain
processes
.



Social
purpose

If
that’s
the
case
,
why
did
consciousness
,
defined
as
subjective
awareness
,
evolve
?



Consciousness
presumably
evolved
as
part
of
the
evolution
of
the
nervous
system
.


According
to
several
theories
the
key
adaptive
function

(providing
an
organism
with
survival
and
reproductive
benefits
)
of
consciousness
is
to
make
volitional
movement
possible
.


And
volition
is
something
we
ultimately
associate
with
will
,
agency
and
individuality
.


It
is
therefore
easy
to
think
that
consciousness
evolved
to
benefit
us
as
individuals
.



Humans
are
a
highly
social
species
.


Esteban
De
Armas/Shuttestock

But
we
have
argued
that
consciousness
may
have
evolved
to
facilitate
key
social
adaptive
functions
.


Rather
than
helping
individuals
survive
,
it
evolved
to
help
us
broadcast
our
experienced
ideas
and
feelings
into
the
wider
world
.


And
this
might
benefit
the
survival
and
wellbeing
of
the
wider
species
.



The
idea
fits
with
new
thinking
on
genetics
.


While
evolutionary
science
traditionally
focuses
on
individual
genes
,
there
is
growing
recognition
that
natural
selection
among
humans
operates
at
multiple
levels
.


For
example
,
culture
and
society
influence
traits
passed
on
between
generations
–
we
value
some
more
than
others
.



Central
to
our
account
is
the
idea
that
sociality
(the
tendency
of
groups
and
individuals
to
develop
social
links
and
live
in
communities
)
is
a
key
survival
strategy
that
influences
how
the
brain
and
cognition
evolve
.



Adopting
this
social
evolutionary
framework
,
we
propose
that
subjective
awareness
lacks
any
independent
capacity
to
causally
influence
other
psychological
processes
or
actions
.


An
example
would
be
initiating
a
course
of
action
.


The
idea
that
subjective
awareness
has
a
social
purpose
has
been
described
previously
by
other
reserachers
.



The
claim
that
subjective
awareness
is
without
causal
influence
,
however
,
is
not
to
deny
the
reality
of
subjective
experience
or
claim
that
the
experience
is
an
illusion
.



While
our
model
removes
subjective
awareness
from
the
traditional
driving
seat
of
the
mind
,
it
does
not
imply
that
we
don’t
value
private
internal
experiences
.


Indeed
,
it
is
precisely
because
of
the
value
we
place
on
these
experiences
that
intuitive
accounts
remain
compelling
and
widespread
in
social
and
legal
organisation
systems
and
psychology
.



While
it
is
counter-intuitive
to
attribute
agency
and
personal
accountability
to
a
biological
assembly
of
nerve
cells
,
it
makes
sense
that
highly
valued
social
constructs
such
as
free
will
,
truth
,
honesty
and
fairness
can
be
meaningfully
attributed
to
individuals
as
accountable
people
in
a
social
community
.



Think
about
it
.


While
we
are
deeply
rooted
in
our
biological
nature
,
our
social
nature
is
largely
defined
by
our
roles
and
interactions
in
society
.


As
such
,
the
mental
architecture
of
the
mind
should
be
strongly
adapted
for
the
exchange
and
reception
of
information
,
ideas
and
feelings
.


Consequently
,
while
brains
as
biological
organs
are
incapable
of
responsibility
and
agency
,
legal
and
social
traditions
have
long
held
individuals
accountable
for
their
behaviour
.



Key
to
achieving
a
more
scientific
explanation
of
subjective
awareness
requires
accepting
that
biology
and
culture
work
collectively
to
shape
how
brains
evolve
.


Subjective
awareness
comprises
only
one
part
of
the
brain’s
much
larger
mental
architecture
designed
to
facilitate
species
survival
and
wellbeing
.
