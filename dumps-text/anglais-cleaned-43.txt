awareness of existence

for other uses see consciousness disambiguation and conscious
disambiguation



not to be confused with conscience or conscientiousness





representation of consciousness from the 17th century by robert fludd
an english paracelsian physician

consciousness at its simplest is awareness of internal and external
existence

1 however its nature has led to millennia of analyses
explanations and debate by philosophers scientists and theologians


opinions differ about what exactly needs to be studied or even
considered consciousness

 in some explanations it is synonymous with
the mind and at other times an aspect of it

 in the past it was one s
inner life the world of introspection of private thought
imagination and volition

2 today it often includes any kind of
cognition experience feeling or perception

 it may be awareness
awareness of awareness metacognition or selfawareness either
continuously changing or not

34 the disparate range of research
notions and speculations raises a curiosity about whether the right
questions are being asked

5

examples of the range of descriptions definitions or explanations are
ordered distinction between self and environment simple wakefulness
one s sense of selfhood or soul explored by looking within being a
metaphorical stream of contents or being a mental state mental
event or mental process of the brain



etymology

edit

the words conscious and consciousness in the english language date
to the 17th century and the first recorded use of conscious as a
simple adjective was applied figuratively to inanimate objects the
conscious groves 1643

6 175 it derived from the latin conscius
con together and scio to know which meant knowing with or
having joint or common knowledge with another especially as in
sharing a secret

7 thomas hobbes in leviathan 1651 wrote where
two or more men know of one and the same fact they are said to be
conscious of it one to another

8 there were also many occurrences
in latin writings of the phrase conscius sibi which translates
literally as knowing with oneself or in other words sharing
knowledge with oneself about something

 this phrase has the figurative
sense of knowing that one knows which is something like the modern
english word conscious but it was rendered into english as conscious
to oneself or conscious unto oneself

 for example archbishop ussher
wrote in 1613 of being so conscious unto myself of my great
weakness

9

the latin conscientia literally knowledgewith first appears in
roman juridical texts by writers such as cicero

 it means a kind of
shared knowledge with moral value specifically what a witness knows of
someone else s deeds

1011 although rené descartes 1596–1650
writing in latin is generally taken to be the first philosopher to use
conscientia in a way less like the traditional meaning and more like the
way modern english speakers would use conscience his meaning is
nowhere defined

12 in search after truth regulæ ad directionem
ingenii ut et inquisitio veritatis per lumen naturale amsterdam 1701
he wrote the word with a gloss conscientiâ vel interno testimonio
translatable as conscience or internal testimony

1314 it
might mean the knowledge of the value of one s own thoughts

12



john locke a 17thcentury british age of enlightenment philosopher

the origin of the modern concept of consciousness is often attributed to
john locke who defined the word in his essay concerning human
understanding published in 1690 as the perception of what passes in a
man s own mind

1516 the essay strongly influenced 18thcentury
british philosophy and locke s definition appeared in samuel johnson s
celebrated dictionary 1755

17

the french term conscience is defined roughly like english
consciousness in the 1753 volume of diderot and d alembert s
encyclopédie as the opinion or internal feeling that we ourselves have
from what we do

18

problem of definition

edit

 about forty meanings attributed to the term consciousness can be
 identified and categorized based on functions and experiences

 the
 prospects for reaching any single agreedupon theoryindependent
 definition of consciousness appear remote

19

scholars are divided as to whether aristotle had a concept of
consciousness

 he does not use any single word or terminology that is
clearly similar to the phenomenon or concept defined by john locke


victor caston contends that aristotle did have a concept more clearly
similar to perception

20

modern dictionary definitions of the word consciousness evolved over
several centuries and reflect a range of seemingly related meanings
with some differences that have been controversial such as the
distinction between inward awareness and perception of the physical
world or the distinction between conscious and unconscious or the
notion of a mental entity or mental activity that is not physical



the commonusage definitions of consciousness in webster s third new
international dictionary 1966 are as follows

1

 awareness or perception of an inward psychological or spiritual
 fact intuitively perceived knowledge of something in one s
 inner self
 inward awareness of an external object state or fact
 concerned awareness interest concern—often used with an
 attributive noun e

g

 class consciousness

2

 the state or activity that is characterized by sensation emotion
 volition or thought mind in the broadest possible sense something
 in nature that is distinguished from the physical

3

 the totality in psychology of sensations perceptions ideas
 attitudes and feelings of which an individual or a group is aware
 at any given time or within a particular time span—compare stream of
 consciousness

4

 waking life as that to which one returns after sleep trance
 fever wherein all one s mental powers have returned 

 

 



5

 the part of mental life or psychic content in psychoanalysis that is
 immediately available to the ego—compare preconscious unconscious

the cambridge english dictionary defines consciousness as the state of
understanding and realizing something

21 the oxford living
dictionary defines consciousness as the state of being aware of and
responsive to one s surroundings a person s awareness or perception
of something and the fact of awareness by the mind of itself and
the world

22

philosophers have attempted to clarify technical distinctions by using a
jargon of their own

 the corresponding entry in the routledge
encyclopedia of philosophy 1998 reads

consciousness
 philosophers have used the term consciousness for four main topics
 knowledge in general intentionality introspection and the
 knowledge it specifically generates and phenomenal experience






 something within one s mind is introspectively conscious just in
 case one introspects it or is poised to do so

 introspection is
 often thought to deliver one s primary knowledge of one s mental
 life

 an experience or other mental entity is phenomenally
 conscious just in case there is something it is like for one to
 have it

 the clearest examples are perceptual experience such as
 tastings and seeings bodilysensational experiences such as those
 of pains tickles and itches imaginative experiences such as those
 of one s own actions or perceptions and streams of thought as in
 the experience of thinking in words or in images 

 introspection
 and phenomenality seem independent or dissociable although this is
 controversial

23

traditional metaphors for mind

edit

during the early 19th century the emerging field of geology inspired a
popular metaphor that the mind likewise had hidden layers which
recorded the past of the individual

24 3 by 1875 most
psychologists believed that consciousness was but a small part of
mental life24 3 and this idea underlies the goal of freudian
therapy to expose the unconscious layer of the mind



other metaphors from various sciences inspired other analyses of the
mind for example johann friedrich herbart described ideas as being
attracted and repulsed like magnets john stuart mill developed the idea
of mental chemistry and mental compounds and edward b

 titchener
sought the structure of the mind by analyzing its elements

 the
abstract idea of states of consciousness mirrored the concept of states
of matter



in 1892 william james noted that the ambiguous word content has been
recently invented instead of object and that the metaphor of mind as
a container seemed to minimize the dualistic problem of how states of
consciousness can know things or objects25 465 by 1899
psychologists were busily studying the contents of conscious experience
by introspection and experiment

26 365 another popular metaphor
was james s doctrine of the stream of consciousness with continuity
fringes and transitions

25 vii a

james discussed the difficulties of describing and studying
psychological phenomena recognizing that commonlyused terminology was
a necessary and acceptable starting point towards more precise
scientifically justified language

 prime examples were phrases like
inner experience and personal consciousness

 the first and foremost concrete fact which every one will affirm to
 belong to his inner experience is the fact that consciousness of some
 sort goes on

 states of mind succeed each other in him

 





 but
 everyone knows what the terms mean only in a rough way 





 when i
 say every state or thought is part of a personal consciousness
 personal consciousness is one of the terms in question

 its meaning
 we know so long as no one asks us to define it but to give an
 accurate account of it is the most difficult of philosophic tasks


 





 the only states of consciousness that we naturally deal with are
 found in personal consciousnesses minds selves concrete particular
 i s and you s

 25 152–153 

from introspection to awareness

edit

prior to the 20th century philosophers treated the phenomenon of
consciousness as the inner world of one s own mind and
introspection was the mind attending to itselfb an activity
seemingly distinct from that of perceiving the outer world and its
physical phenomena

 in 1892 william james noted the distinction along
with doubts about the inward character of the mind

 things have been doubted but thoughts and feelings have never been
 doubted

 the outer world but never the inner world has been denied


 everyone assumes that we have direct introspective acquaintance with
 our thinking activity as such with our consciousness as something
 inward and contrasted with the outer objects which it knows

 yet i
 must confess that for my part i cannot feel sure of this conclusion


 





 it seems as if consciousness as an inner activity were rather a
 postulate than a sensibly given fact





25 467 

by the 1960s for many philosophers and psychologists who talked about
consciousness the word no longer meant the inner world but an
indefinite large category called awareness as in the following
example

 it is difficult for modern western man to grasp that the greeks really
 had no concept of consciousness in that they did not class together
 phenomena as varied as problem solving remembering imagining
 perceiving feeling pain dreaming and acting on the grounds that all
 these are manifestations of being aware or being conscious

28 4 

many philosophers and scientists have been unhappy about the difficulty
of producing a definition that does not involve circularity or
fuzziness

29 in the macmillan dictionary of psychology 1989
edition stuart sutherland emphasized external awareness and expressed
a skeptical attitude more than a definition

 consciousness—the having of perceptions thoughts and feelings
 awareness

 the term is impossible to define except in terms that are
 unintelligible without a grasp of what consciousness means

 many fall
 into the trap of equating consciousness with selfconsciousness—to be
 conscious it is only necessary to be aware of the external world


 consciousness is a fascinating but elusive phenomenon it is
 impossible to specify what it is what it does or why it has evolved


 nothing worth reading has been written on it

29

using awareness however as a definition or synonym of consciousness
is not a simple matter

 if awareness of the environment 

 

 

 is the criterion of
 consciousness then even the protozoans are conscious

 if awareness of
 awareness is required then it is doubtful whether the great apes and
 human infants are conscious

26

influence on research

edit

many philosophers have argued that consciousness is a unitary concept
that is understood by the majority of people despite the difficulty
philosophers have had defining it

30 max velmans proposed that the
everyday understanding of consciousness uncontroversially refers to
experience itself rather than any particular thing that we observe or
experience and he added that consciousness is therefore exemplified
by all the things that we observe or experience31 4 whether
thoughts feelings or perceptions

 velmans noted however as of 2009
that there was a deep level of confusion and internal division31
among experts about the phenomenon of consciousness because researchers
lacked a sufficiently wellspecified use of the term





to agree that
they are investigating the same thing

31 3 he argued
additionally that preexisting theoretical commitments to competing
explanations of consciousness might be a source of bias



within the modern consciousness studies community the technical phrase
 phenomenal consciousness is a common synonym for all forms of
awareness or simply experience 31 4 without differentiating
between inner and outer or between higher and lower types

 with
advances in brain research the presence or absence of experienced
phenomena31 3 of any kind underlies the work of those
neuroscientists who seek to analyze the precise relation of conscious
phenomenology to its associated information processing in the
brain

31 10 this neuroscientific goal is to find the neural
correlates of consciousness ncc

 one criticism of this goal is that
it begins with a theoretical commitment to the neurological origin of
all experienced phenomena whether inner or outer

c also the fact
that the easiest content of consciousness to be so analyzed is the
experienced threedimensional world the phenomenal world beyond the
body surface31 4 invites another criticism that most
consciousness research since the 1990s perhaps because of bias has
focused on processes of external perception

33

from a history of psychology perspective julian jaynes rejected popular
but superficial views of consciousness2 447 especially those
which equate it with that vaguest of terms experience

24 8 in
1976 he insisted that if not for introspection which for decades had
been ignored or taken for granted rather than explained there could be
no conception of what consciousness is24 18 and in 1990 he
reaffirmed the traditional idea of the phenomenon called
 consciousness writing that its denotative definition is as it was
for rené descartes john locke and david hume what is
introspectable

2 450 jaynes saw consciousness as an important
but small part of human mentality and he asserted there can be no
progress in the science of consciousness until 





 what is
introspectable is sharply distinguished2 447 from the
unconscious processes of cognition such as perception reactive
awareness and attention and automatic forms of learning
problemsolving and decisionmaking

24 2147 

the cognitive science point of view—with an interdisciplinary
perspective involving fields such as psychology linguistics and
anthropology34—requires no agreed definition of consciousness but
studies the interaction of many processes besides perception

 for some
researchers consciousness is linked to some kind of selfhood for
example to certain pragmatic issues such as the feeling of agency and
the effects of regret33 and action on experience of one s own body
or social identity

35 similarly daniel kahneman who focused on
systematic errors in perception memory and decisionmaking has
differentiated between two kinds of mental processes or cognitive
systems36 the fast activities that are primary automatic and
cannot be turned off36 22 and the slow deliberate
effortful activities of a secondary system often associated with the
subjective experience of agency choice and concentration

36 13 
kahneman s two systems have been described as roughly corresponding to
unconscious and conscious processes

37 8 the two systems can
interact for example in sharing the control of attention

36 22 
while system 1 can be impulsive system 2 is in charge of
selfcontrol36 26 and when we think of ourselves we identify
with system 2 the conscious reasoning self that has beliefs makes
choices and decides what to think about and what to do

36 21 

some have argued that we should eliminate the concept from our
understanding of the mind a position known as consciousness
semanticism

38

in medicine a level of consciousness terminology is used to describe
a patient s arousal and responsiveness which can be seen as a continuum
of states ranging from full alertness and comprehension through
disorientation delirium loss of meaningful communication and finally
loss of movement in response to painful stimuli

39 issues of
practical concern include how the level of consciousness can be assessed
in severely ill comatose or anesthetized people and how to treat
conditions in which consciousness is impaired or disrupted

40 the
degree or level of consciousness is measured by standardized behavior
observation scales such as the glasgow coma scale



philosophy of mind

edit

while historically philosophers have defended various views on
consciousness surveys indicate that physicalism is now the dominant
position among contemporary philosophers of mind

41 for an overview
of the field approaches often include both historical perspectives
e

g

 descartes locke kant and organization by key issues in
contemporary debates

 an alternative is to focus primarily on current
philosophical stances and empirical findings



coherence of the concept

edit

philosophers differ from nonphilosophers in their intuitions about what
consciousness is

42 while most people have a strong intuition for
the existence of what they refer to as consciousness30 skeptics
argue that this intuition is too narrow either because the concept of
consciousness is embedded in our intuitions or because we all are
illusions

 gilbert ryle for example argued that traditional
understanding of consciousness depends on a cartesian dualist outlook
that improperly distinguishes between mind and body or between mind and
world

 he proposed that we speak not of minds bodies and the world
but of entities or identities acting in the world

 thus by speaking
of consciousness we end up leading ourselves by thinking that there is
any sort of thing as consciousness separated from behavioral and
linguistic understandings

43

types

edit

ned block argued that discussions on consciousness often failed to
properly distinguish phenomenal pconsciousness from access
aconsciousness though these terms had been used before block

44
pconsciousness according to block is raw experience it is moving
colored forms sounds sensations emotions and feelings with our bodies
and responses at the center

 these experiences considered independently
of any impact on behavior are called qualia

 aconsciousness on the
other hand is the phenomenon whereby information in our minds is
accessible for verbal report reasoning and the control of behavior


so when we perceive information about what we perceive is access
conscious when we introspect information about our thoughts is access
conscious when we remember information about the past is access
conscious and so on

 although some philosophers such as daniel
dennett have disputed the validity of this distinction45 others
have broadly accepted it

 david chalmers has argued that aconsciousness
can in principle be understood in mechanistic terms but that
understanding pconsciousness is much more challenging he calls this
the hard problem of consciousness

46

some philosophers believe that block s two types of consciousness are
not the end of the story

 william lycan for example argued in his book
consciousness and experience that at least eight clearly distinct types
of consciousness can be identified organism consciousness control
consciousness consciousness of stateevent consciousness
reportability introspective consciousness subjective consciousness
selfconsciousness—and that even this list omits several more obscure
forms

47

there is also debate over whether or not aconsciousness and
pconsciousness always coexist or if they can exist separately

 although
pconsciousness without aconsciousness is more widely accepted there
have been some hypothetical examples of a without p

 block for
instance suggests the case of a zombie that is computationally
identical to a person but without any subjectivity

 however he remains
somewhat skeptical concluding i don t know whether there are any actual
cases of aconsciousness without pconsciousness but i hope i have
illustrated their conceptual possibility

48

distinguishing consciousness from its contents

edit

sam harris observes at the level of your experience you are not a
body of cells organelles and atoms you are consciousness and its
everchanging contents

49 seen in this way consciousness is a
subjectively experienced everpresent field in which things the
contents of consciousness come and go



christopher tricker argues that this field of consciousness is
symbolized by the mythical bird that opens the daoist classic the
zhuangzi

 this bird s name is of a flock peng 鵬 yet its back is
countless thousands of miles across and its wings are like clouds arcing
across the heavens

 like of a flock whose wings arc across the
heavens the wings of your consciousness span to the horizon

 at the
same time the wings of every other being s consciousness span to the
horizon

 you are of a flock one bird among kin

50

mind–body problem

edit

main article mind–body problem



illustration of mind–body dualism by rené descartes

 inputs are passed
by the sensory organs to the pineal gland and from there to the
immaterial spirit



mental processes such as consciousness and physical processes such as
brain events seem to be correlated however the specific nature of the
connection is unknown



the first influential philosopher to discuss this question specifically
was descartes and the answer he gave is known as mind–body dualism


descartes proposed that consciousness resides within an immaterial
domain he called res cogitans the realm of thought in contrast to the
domain of material things which he called res extensa the realm of
extension

51 he suggested that the interaction between these two
domains occurs inside the brain perhaps in a small midline structure
called the pineal gland

52

although it is widely accepted that descartes explained the problem
cogently few later philosophers have been happy with his solution and
his ideas about the pineal gland have especially been ridiculed

53
however no alternative solution has gained general acceptance

 proposed
solutions can be divided broadly into two categories dualist solutions
that maintain descartes s rigid distinction between the realm of
consciousness and the realm of matter but give different answers for how
the two realms relate to each other and monist solutions that maintain
that there is really only one realm of being of which consciousness and
matter are both aspects

 each of these categories itself contains
numerous variants

 the two main types of dualism are substance dualism
which holds that the mind is formed of a distinct type of substance not
governed by the laws of physics and property dualism which holds that
the laws of physics are universally valid but cannot be used to explain
the mind

 the three main types of monism are physicalism which holds
that the mind consists of matter organized in a particular way
idealism which holds that only thought or experience truly exists and
matter is merely an illusion and neutral monism which holds that both
mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself
identical to neither of them

 there are also however a large number
of idiosyncratic theories that cannot cleanly be assigned to any of
these schools of thought

54

since the dawn of newtonian science with its vision of simple mechanical
principles governing the entire universe some philosophers have been
tempted by the idea that consciousness could be explained in purely
physical terms

 the first influential writer to propose such an idea
explicitly was julien offray de la mettrie in his book man a machine
l homme machine

 his arguments however were very abstract

55
the most influential modern physical theories of consciousness are based
on psychology and neuroscience

 theories proposed by neuroscientists
such as gerald edelman56 and antonio damasio57 and by
philosophers such as daniel dennett58 seek to explain
consciousness in terms of neural events occurring within the brain

 many
other neuroscientists such as christof koch59 have explored the
neural basis of consciousness without attempting to frame
allencompassing global theories

 at the same time computer scientists
working in the field of artificial intelligence have pursued the goal of
creating digital computer programs that can simulate or embody
consciousness

60

a few theoretical physicists have argued that classical physics is
intrinsically incapable of explaining the holistic aspects of
consciousness but that quantum theory may provide the missing
ingredients

 several theorists have therefore proposed quantum mind qm
theories of consciousness

61 notable theories falling into this
category include the holonomic brain theory of karl pribram and david
bohm and the orchor theory formulated by stuart hameroff and roger
penrose

 some of these qm theories offer descriptions of phenomenal
consciousness as well as qm interpretations of access consciousness


none of the quantum mechanical theories have been confirmed by
experiment

 recent publications by g

 guerreshi j

 cia s

 popescu and
h

 briegel62 could falsify proposals such as those of hameroff
which rely on quantum entanglement in protein

 at the present time many
scientists and philosophers consider the arguments for an important role
of quantum phenomena to be unconvincing

63 empirical evidence is
against the notion of quantum consciousness an experiment about wave
function collapse led by catalina curceanu in 2022 suggests that quantum
consciousness as suggested by roger penrose and stuart hameroff is
highly implausible

64

apart from the general question of the hard problem of consciousness
which is roughly speaking the question of how mental experience can
arise from a physical basis65 a more specialized question is how
to square the subjective notion that we are in control of our decisions
at least in some small measure with the customary view of causality
that subsequent events are caused by prior events

 the topic of free
will is the philosophical and scientific examination of this conundrum



problem of other minds

edit

main article problem of other minds

many philosophers consider experience to be the essence of
consciousness and believe that experience can only fully be known from
the inside subjectively

 the problem of other minds is a philosophical
problem traditionally stated as the following epistemological question
given that i can only observe the behavior of others how can i know
that others have minds

66 the problem of other minds is
particularly acute for people who believe in the possibility of
philosophical zombies that is people who think it is possible in
principle to have an entity that is physically indistinguishable from a
human being and behaves like a human being in every way but nevertheless
lacks consciousness

67 related issues have also been studied
extensively by greg littmann of the university of illinois68 and
by colin allen a professor at the university of pittsburgh regarding
the literature and research studying artificial intelligence in
androids

69

the most commonly given answer is that we attribute consciousness to
other people because we see that they resemble us in appearance and
behavior we reason that if they look like us and act like us they must
be like us in other ways including having experiences of the sort that
we do

70 there are however a variety of problems with that
explanation

 for one thing it seems to violate the principle of
parsimony by postulating an invisible entity that is not necessary to
explain what we observe

70 some philosophers such as daniel
dennett in a research paper titled the unimagined preposterousness of
zombies argue that people who give this explanation do not really
understand what they are saying

71 more broadly philosophers who
do not accept the possibility of zombies generally believe that
consciousness is reflected in behavior including verbal behavior and
that we attribute consciousness on the basis of behavior

 a more
straightforward way of saying this is that we attribute experiences to
people because of what they can do including the fact that they can
tell us about their experiences

72

qualia

edit

main article qualia

the term qualia was introduced in philosophical literature by c

 i


lewis

 the word is derived from latin and means of what sort

 it is
basically a quantity or property of something as perceived or
experienced by an individual like the scent of rose the taste of wine
or the pain of a headache

 they are difficult to articulate or describe


the philosopher and scientist daniel dennett describes them as the way
things seem to us while philosopher and cognitive scientist david
chalmers expanded on qualia as the hard problem of consciousness in
the 1990s

 when qualia is experienced activity is simulated in the
brain and these processes are called neural correlates of consciousness
nccs

 many scientific studies have been done to attempt to link
particular brain regions with emotions or experiences

737475

species which experience qualia are said to have sentience which is
central to the animal rights movement because it includes the ability
to experience pain and suffering

73

scientific study

edit

for many decades consciousness as a research topic was avoided by the
majority of mainstream scientists because of a general feeling that a
phenomenon defined in subjective terms could not properly be studied
using objective experimental methods

76 in 1975 george mandler
published an influential psychological study which distinguished between
slow serial and limited conscious processes and fast parallel and
extensive unconscious ones

77 the science and religion forum78
1984 annual conference from artificial intelligence to human
consciousness identified the nature of consciousness as a matter for
investigation donald michie was a keynote speaker

 starting in the
1980s an expanding community of neuroscientists and psychologists have
associated themselves with a field called consciousness studies giving
rise to a stream of experimental work published in books79
journals such as consciousness and cognition frontiers in consciousness
research psyche and the journal of consciousness studies along with
regular conferences organized by groups such as the association for the
scientific study of consciousness80 and the society for
consciousness studies



modern medical and psychological investigations into consciousness are
based on psychological experiments including for example the
investigation of priming effects using subliminal stimuli81 and
on case studies of alterations in consciousness produced by trauma
illness or drugs

 broadly viewed scientific approaches are based on
two core concepts

 the first identifies the content of consciousness
with the experiences that are reported by human subjects the second
makes use of the concept of consciousness that has been developed by
neurologists and other medical professionals who deal with patients
whose behavior is impaired

 in either case the ultimate goals are to
develop techniques for assessing consciousness objectively in humans as
well as other animals and to understand the neural and psychological
mechanisms that underlie it

measurement via verbal report

edit



the necker cube an ambiguous image

experimental research on consciousness presents special difficulties
due to the lack of a universally accepted operational definition

 in the
majority of experiments that are specifically about consciousness the
subjects are human and the criterion used is verbal report in other
words subjects are asked to describe their experiences and their
descriptions are treated as observations of the contents of
consciousness

82

for example subjects who stare continuously at a necker cube usually
report that they experience it flipping between two 3d configurations
even though the stimulus itself remains the same

83 the objective
is to understand the relationship between the conscious awareness of
stimuli as indicated by verbal report and the effects the stimuli have
on brain activity and behavior

 in several paradigms such as the
technique of response priming the behavior of subjects is clearly
influenced by stimuli for which they report no awareness and suitable
experimental manipulations can lead to increasing priming effects
despite decreasing prime identification double dissociation

84

verbal report is widely considered to be the most reliable indicator of
consciousness but it raises a number of issues

85 for one thing
if verbal reports are treated as observations akin to observations in
other branches of science then the possibility arises that they may
contain errors—but it is difficult to make sense of the idea that
subjects could be wrong about their own experiences and even more
difficult to see how such an error could be detected

86 daniel
dennett has argued for an approach he calls heterophenomenology which
means treating verbal reports as stories that may or may not be true
but his ideas about how to do this have not been widely adopted

87
another issue with verbal report as a criterion is that it restricts the
field of study to humans who have language this approach cannot be used
to study consciousness in other species prelinguistic children or
people with types of brain damage that impair language

 as a third
issue philosophers who dispute the validity of the turing test may feel
that it is possible at least in principle for verbal report to be
dissociated from consciousness entirely a philosophical zombie may give
detailed verbal reports of awareness in the absence of any genuine
awareness

88

although verbal report is in practice the gold standard for ascribing
consciousness it is not the only possible criterion

85 in
medicine consciousness is assessed as a combination of verbal behavior
arousal brain activity and purposeful movement

 the last three of
these can be used as indicators of consciousness when verbal behavior is
absent

8990 the scientific literature regarding the neural bases
of arousal and purposeful movement is very extensive

 their reliability
as indicators of consciousness is disputed however due to numerous
studies showing that alert human subjects can be induced to behave
purposefully in a variety of ways in spite of reporting a complete lack
of awareness

84 studies related to the neuroscience of free will
have also shown that the influence consciousness has on decisionmaking
is not always straightforward

91

mirror test and contingency awareness

edit



mirror test subjected on a common octopus

see also mirror test

another approach applies specifically to the study of selfawareness
that is the ability to distinguish oneself from others

 in the 1970s
gordon gallup developed an operational test for selfawareness known as
the mirror test

 the test examines whether animals are able to
differentiate between seeing themselves in a mirror versus seeing other
animals

 the classic example involves placing a spot of coloring on the
skin or fur near the individual s forehead and seeing if they attempt to
remove it or at least touch the spot thus indicating that they
recognize that the individual they are seeing in the mirror is
themselves

92 humans older than 18 months and other great apes
bottlenose dolphins orcas pigeons european magpies and elephants have
all been observed to pass this test

93 while some other animals
like pigs have been shown to find food by looking into the
mirror

94

contingency awareness is another such approach which is basically the
conscious understanding of one s actions and its effects on one s
environment

95 it is recognized as a factor in selfrecognition


the brain processes during contingency awareness and learning is
believed to rely on an intact medial temporal lobe and age

 a study done
in 2020 involving transcranial direct current stimulation magnetic
resonance imaging mri and eyeblink classical conditioning supported
the idea that the parietal cortex serves as a substrate for contingency
awareness and that agerelated disruption of this region is sufficient
to impair awareness

96

neural correlates

edit



schema of the neural processes underlying consciousness from christof
koch

a major part of the scientific literature on consciousness consists of
studies that examine the relationship between the experiences reported
by subjects and the activity that simultaneously takes place in their
brains—that is studies of the neural correlates of consciousness

 the
hope is to find that activity in a particular part of the brain or a
particular pattern of global brain activity which will be strongly
predictive of conscious awareness

 several brain imaging techniques
such as eeg and fmri have been used for physical measures of brain
activity in these studies

97

another idea that has drawn attention for several decades is that
consciousness is associated with highfrequency gamma band
oscillations in brain activity

 this idea arose from proposals in the
1980s by christof von der malsburg and wolf singer that gamma
oscillations could solve the socalled binding problem by linking
information represented in different parts of the brain into a unified
experience

98 rodolfo llinás for example proposed that
consciousness results from recurrent thalamocortical resonance where
the specific thalamocortical systems content and the nonspecific
centromedial thalamus thalamocortical systems context interact in
the gamma band frequency via synchronous oscillations

99

a number of studies have shown that activity in primary sensory areas of
the brain is not sufficient to produce consciousness it is possible for
subjects to report a lack of awareness even when areas such as the
primary visual cortex v1 show clear electrical responses to a
stimulus

100 higher brain areas are seen as more promising
especially the prefrontal cortex which is involved in a range of higher
cognitive functions collectively known as executive functions

101
there is substantial evidence that a topdown flow of neural activity
i

e

 activity propagating from the frontal cortex to sensory areas is
more predictive of conscious awareness than a bottomup flow of
activity

102 the prefrontal cortex is not the only candidate area
however studies by nikos logothetis and his colleagues have shown for
example that visually responsive neurons in parts of the temporal lobe
reflect the visual perception in the situation when conflicting visual
images are presented to different eyes i

e

 bistable percepts during
binocular rivalry

103 furthermore topdown feedback from higher
to lower visual brain areas may be weaker or absent in the peripheral
visual field as suggested by some experimental data and theoretical
arguments104 nevertheless humans can perceive visual inputs in the
peripheral visual field arising from bottomup v1 neural
activities

104105 meanwhile bottomup v1 activities for the
central visual fields can be vetoed and thus made invisible to
perception by the topdown feedback when these bottomup signals are
inconsistent with the brain s internal model of the visual
world

104105

modulation of neural responses may correlate with phenomenal
experiences

 in contrast to the raw electrical responses that do not
correlate with consciousness the modulation of these responses by other
stimuli correlates surprisingly well with an important aspect of
consciousness namely with the phenomenal experience of stimulus
intensity brightness contrast

 in the research group of danko nikolić
it has been shown that some of the changes in the subjectively perceived
brightness correlated with the modulation of firing rates while others
correlated with the modulation of neural synchrony

106 an fmri
investigation suggested that these findings were strictly limited to the
primary visual areas

107 this indicates that in the primary visual
areas changes in firing rates and synchrony can be considered as neural
correlates of qualia—at least for some type of qualia



in 2013 the perturbational complexity index pci was proposed a
measure of the algorithmic complexity of the electrophysiological
response of the cortex to transcranial magnetic stimulation

 this
measure was shown to be higher in individuals that are awake in rem
sleep or in a lockedin state than in those who are in deep sleep or in
a vegetative state108 making it potentially useful as a
quantitative assessment of consciousness states



assuming that not only humans but even some nonmammalian species are
conscious a number of evolutionary approaches to the problem of neural
correlates of consciousness open up

 for example assuming that birds
are conscious—a common assumption among neuroscientists and ethologists
due to the extensive cognitive repertoire of birds—there are comparative
neuroanatomical ways to validate some of the principal currently
competing mammalian consciousness–brain theories

 the rationale for
such a comparative study is that the avian brain deviates structurally
from the mammalian brain

 so how similar are they

 what homologs can be
identified

 the general conclusion from the study by butler et
al

109 is that some of the major theories for the mammalian
brain110111112 also appear to be valid for the avian brain

 the
structures assumed to be critical for consciousness in mammalian brains
have homologous counterparts in avian brains

 thus the main portions of
the theories of crick and koch110 edelman and tononi111 and
cotterill 112 seem to be compatible with the assumption that birds
are conscious

 edelman also differentiates between what he calls primary
consciousness which is a trait shared by humans and nonhuman animals
and higherorder consciousness as it appears in humans alone along with
human language capacity

111 certain aspects of the three theories
however seem less easy to apply to the hypothesis of avian
consciousness

 for instance the suggestion by crick and koch that layer
5 neurons of the mammalian brain have a special role seems difficult to
apply to the avian brain since the avian homologs have a different
morphology

 likewise the theory of eccles113114 seems
incompatible since a structural homologanalogue to the dendron has not
been found in avian brains

 the assumption of an avian consciousness
also brings the reptilian brain into focus

 the reason is the structural
continuity between avian and reptilian brains meaning that the
phylogenetic origin of consciousness may be earlier than suggested by
many leading neuroscientists



joaquin fuster of ucla has advocated the position of the importance of
the prefrontal cortex in humans along with the areas of wernicke and
broca as being of particular importance to the development of human
language capacities neuroanatomically necessary for the emergence of
higherorder consciousness in humans

115

a study in 2016 looked at lesions in specific areas of the brainstem
that were associated with coma and vegetative states

 a small region of
the rostral dorsolateral pontine tegmentum in the brainstem was
suggested to drive consciousness through functional connectivity with
two cortical regions the left ventral anterior insular cortex and the
pregenual anterior cingulate cortex

 these three regions may work
together as a triad to maintain consciousness

116

models

edit

further information models of consciousness

a wide range of empirical theories of consciousness have been
proposed

117118119 adrian doerig and colleagues list 13 notable
theories119 while anil seth and tim bayne list 22 notable
theories

118

global workspace theory

edit

global workspace theory gwt is a cognitive architecture and theory of
consciousness proposed by the cognitive psychologist bernard baars in
1988

 baars explains the theory with the metaphor of a theater with
conscious processes represented by an illuminated stage

 this theater
integrates inputs from a variety of unconscious and otherwise autonomous
networks in the brain and then broadcasts them to unconscious networks
represented in the metaphor by a broad unlit audience

 the theory
has since been expanded upon by other scientists including cognitive
neuroscientist stanislas dehaene and lionel naccache

120121

integrated information theory

edit

integrated information theory iit pioneered by neuroscientist giulio
tononi in 2004 postulates that consciousness resides in the information
being processed and arises once the information reaches a certain level
of complexity

 additionally iit is one of the only leading theories of
consciousness that attempts to create a 11 mapping between conscious
states and precise formal mathematical descriptions of those mental
states

 proponents of this model suggest that it may provide a physical
grounding for consciousness in neurons as they provide the mechanism by
which information is integrated

 this also relates to the hard problem
of consciousness proposed by david chalmers

 the theory remains
controversial because of its lack of
credibility

clarification needed12212373

orchestrated objective reduction

edit

orchestrated objective reduction orchor or the quantum theory of
mind was proposed by scientists roger penrose and stuart hameroff and
states that consciousness originates at the quantum level inside
neurons

 the mechanism is held to be a quantum process called objective
reduction that is orchestrated by cellular structures called
microtubules which form the cytoskeleton around which the brain is
built

 the duo proposed that these quantum processes accounted for
creativity innovation and problemsolving abilities

 penrose published
his views in the book the emperor s new mind

 in 2014 the discovery of
quantum vibrations inside microtubules gave new life to the
argument

73

attention schema theory

edit

in 2011 graziano and kastner124 proposed the attention schema
theory of awareness

 in that theory specific cortical areas notably in
the superior temporal sulcus and the temporoparietal junction are used
to build the construct of awareness and attribute it to other people


the same cortical machinery is also used to attribute awareness to
oneself

 damage to these cortical regions can lead to deficits in
consciousness such as hemispatial neglect

 in the attention schema
theory the value of explaining the feature of awareness and attributing
it to a person is to gain a useful predictive model of that person s
attentional processing

 attention is a style of information processing
in which a brain focuses its resources on a limited set of interrelated
signals

 awareness in this theory is a useful simplified schema that
represents attentional states

 to be aware of x is explained by
constructing a model of one s attentional focus on x



entropic brain theory

edit

the entropic brain is a theory of conscious states informed by
neuroimaging research with psychedelic drugs

 the theory suggests that
the brain in primary states such as rapid eye movement rem sleep
early psychosis and under the influence of psychedelic drugs is in a
disordered state normal waking consciousness constrains some of this
freedom and makes possible metacognitive functions such as internal
selfadministered reality testing and
selfawareness

125126127128 criticism has included
questioning whether the theory has been adequately tested

129

projective consciousness model

edit

in 2017 work by david rudrauf and colleagues including karl friston
applied the active inference paradigm to consciousness leading to the
projective consciousness model pcm a model of how sensory data is
integrated with priors in a process of projective transformation

 the
authors argue that while their model identifies a key relationship
between computation and phenomenology it does not completely solve the
hard problem of consciousness or completely close the explanatory
gap

130

claustrum being the conductor for consciousness

edit

in 2004 a proposal was made by molecular biologist francis crick
codiscoverer of the double helix which stated that to bind together
an individual s experience a conductor of an orchestra is required


together with neuroscientist christof koch he proposed that this
conductor would have to collate information rapidly from various regions
of the brain

 the duo reckoned that the claustrum was well suited for
the task

 however crick died while working on the idea

73

the proposal is backed by a study done in 2014 where a team at the
george washington university induced unconsciousness in a 54yearold
woman suffering from intractable epilepsy by stimulating her claustrum


the woman underwent depth electrode implantation and electrical
stimulation mapping

 the electrode between the left claustrum and
anteriordorsal insula was the one which induced unconsciousness


correlation for interactions affecting medial parietal and posterior
frontal channels during stimulation increased significantly as well


their findings suggested that the left claustrum or anterior insula is
an important part of a network that subserves consciousness and that
disruption of consciousness is related to increased eeg signal synchrony
within frontalparietal networks

 however this remains an isolated
hence inconclusive study

73131

biological function and evolution

edit

the emergence of consciousness during biological evolution remains a
topic of ongoing scientific inquiry

 the survival value of consciousness
is still a matter of exploration and understanding

 while consciousness
appears to play a crucial role in human cognition decisionmaking and
selfawareness its adaptive significance across different species
remains a subject of debate



some people question whether consciousness has any survival value

 some
argue that consciousness is a byproduct of evolution

 thomas henry
huxley for example defends in an essay titled on the hypothesis that
animals are automata and its history an epiphenomenalist theory of
consciousness according to which consciousness is a causally inert
effect of neural activity—as the steamwhistle which accompanies the
work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its
machinery

132 to this william james objects in his essay are we
automata

 by stating an evolutionary argument for mindbrain interaction
implying that if the preservation and development of consciousness in
the biological evolution is a result of natural selection it is
plausible that consciousness has not only been influenced by neural
processes but has had a survival value itself and it could only have
had this if it had been efficacious

133134 karl popper develops a
similar evolutionary argument in the book the self and its
brain

135

opinions are divided on when and how consciousness first arose

 it has
been argued that consciousness emerged i exclusively with the first
humans ii exclusively with the first mammals iii independently in
mammals and birds or iv with the first reptiles

136 other
authors date the origins of consciousness to the first animals with
nervous systems or early vertebrates in the cambrian over 500 million
years ago

137 donald griffin suggests in his book animal minds a
gradual evolution of consciousness

138 further exploration of the
origins of consciousness particularly in molluscs has been done by
peter godfrey smith in his book metazoa

139

regarding the primary function of conscious processing a recurring idea
in recent theories is that phenomenal states somehow integrate neural
activities and informationprocessing that would otherwise be
independent

140 this has been called the integration consensus


another example has been proposed by gerald edelman called dynamic core
hypothesis which puts emphasis on reentrant connections that
reciprocally link areas of the brain in a massively parallel
manner

141 edelman also stresses the importance of the evolutionary
emergence of higherorder consciousness in humans from the historically
older trait of primary consciousness which humans share with nonhuman
animals see neural correlates section above

 these theories of
integrative function present solutions to two classic problems
associated with consciousness differentiation and unity

 they show how
our conscious experience can discriminate between a virtually unlimited
number of different possible scenes and details differentiation
because it integrates those details from our sensory systems while the
integrative nature of consciousness in this view easily explains how our
experience can seem unified as one whole despite all of these individual
parts

 however it remains unspecified which kinds of information are
integrated in a conscious manner and which kinds can be integrated
without consciousness

 nor is it explained what specific causal role
conscious integration plays nor why the same functionality cannot be
achieved without consciousness

 not all kinds of information are capable
of being disseminated consciously e

g

 neural activity related to
vegetative functions reflexes unconscious motor programs lowlevel
perceptual analyzes etc

 and many kinds of information can be
disseminated and combined with other kinds without consciousness as in
intersensory interactions such as the ventriloquism effect

142
hence it remains unclear why any of it is conscious

 for a review of the
differences between conscious and unconscious integrations see the
article of ezequiel morsella

142

as noted earlier even among writers who consider consciousness to be
welldefined there is widespread dispute about which animals other than
humans can be said to possess it

143 edelman has described this
distinction as that of humans possessing higherorder consciousness
while sharing the trait of primary consciousness with nonhuman animals
see previous paragraph

 thus any examination of the evolution of
consciousness is faced with great difficulties

 nevertheless some
writers have argued that consciousness can be viewed from the standpoint
of evolutionary biology as an adaptation in the sense of a trait that
increases fitness

144 in his article evolution of consciousness
john eccles argued that special anatomical and physical properties of
the mammalian cerebral cortex gave rise to consciousness a psychon






 linked to a dendron through quantum physics

145 bernard
baars proposed that once in place this recursive circuitry may have
provided a basis for the subsequent development of many of the functions
that consciousness facilitates in higher organisms

146 peter
carruthers has put forth one such potential adaptive advantage gained by
conscious creatures by suggesting that consciousness allows an
individual to make distinctions between appearance and reality

147
this ability would enable a creature to recognize the likelihood that
their perceptions are deceiving them e

g

 that water in the distance
may be a mirage and behave accordingly and it could also facilitate
the manipulation of others by recognizing how things appear to them for
both cooperative and devious ends



other philosophers however have suggested that consciousness would not
be necessary for any functional advantage in evolutionary
processes

148149 no one has given a causal explanation they
argue of why it would not be possible for a functionally equivalent
nonconscious organism i

e

 a philosophical zombie to achieve the
very same survival advantages as a conscious organism

 if evolutionary
processes are blind to the difference between function f being performed
by conscious organism o and nonconscious organism o it is unclear
what adaptive advantage consciousness could provide

150 as a
result an exaptive explanation of consciousness has gained favor with
some theorists that posit consciousness did not evolve as an adaptation
but was an exaptation arising as a consequence of other developments
such as increases in brain size or cortical rearrangement

137
consciousness in this sense has been compared to the blind spot in the
retina where it is not an adaption of the retina but instead just a
byproduct of the way the retinal axons were wired

151 several
scholars including pinker chomsky edelman and luria have indicated
the importance of the emergence of human language as an important
regulative mechanism of learning and memory in the context of the
development of higherorder consciousness see neural correlates section
above



altered states

edit



a buddhist monk meditating

main article altered state of consciousness

there are some brain states in which consciousness seems to be absent
including dreamless sleep or coma

 there are also a variety of
circumstances that can change the relationship between the mind and the
world in less drastic ways producing what are known as altered states
of consciousness

 some altered states occur naturally others can be
produced by drugs or brain damage

152 altered states can be
accompanied by changes in thinking disturbances in the sense of time
feelings of loss of control changes in emotional expression
alternations in body image and changes in meaning or
significance

153

the two most widely accepted altered states are sleep and dreaming


although dream sleep and nondream sleep appear very similar to an
outside observer each is associated with a distinct pattern of brain
activity metabolic activity and eye movement each is also associated
with a distinct pattern of experience and cognition

 during ordinary
nondream sleep people who are awakened report only vague and sketchy
thoughts and their experiences do not cohere into a continuous
narrative

 during dream sleep in contrast people who are awakened
report rich and detailed experiences in which events form a continuous
progression which may however be interrupted by bizarre or fantastic
intrusions

154failed verification thought processes during the
dream state frequently show a high level of irrationality

 both dream
and nondream states are associated with severe disruption of memory it
usually disappears in seconds during the nondream state and in minutes
after awakening from a dream unless actively refreshed

155

research conducted on the effects of partial epileptic seizures on
consciousness found that patients who have partial epileptic seizures
experience altered states of consciousness

156157 in partial
epileptic seizures consciousness is impaired or lost while some aspects
of consciousness often automated behaviors remain intact

 studies
found that when measuring the qualitative features during partial
epileptic seizures patients exhibited an increase in arousal and became
absorbed in the experience of the seizure followed by difficulty in
focusing and shifting attention



a variety of psychoactive drugs including alcohol have notable effects
on consciousness

158 these range from a simple dulling of awareness
produced by sedatives to increases in the intensity of sensory
qualities produced by stimulants cannabis empathogens–entactogens such
as mdma ecstasy or most notably by the class of drugs known as
psychedelics

152 lsd mescaline psilocybin dimethyltryptamine
and others in this group can produce major distortions of perception
including hallucinations some users even describe their druginduced
experiences as mystical or spiritual in quality

 the brain mechanisms
underlying these effects are not as well understood as those induced by
use of alcohol158 but there is substantial evidence that
alterations in the brain system that uses the chemical neurotransmitter
serotonin play an essential role

159

there has been some research into physiological changes in yogis and
people who practise various techniques of meditation

 some research with
brain waves during meditation has reported differences between those
corresponding to ordinary relaxation and those corresponding to
meditation

 it has been disputed however whether there is enough
evidence to count these as physiologically distinct states of
consciousness

160

the most extensive study of the characteristics of altered states of
consciousness was made by psychologist charles tart in the 1960s and
1970s

 tart analyzed a state of consciousness as made up of a number of
component processes including exteroception sensing the external
world interoception sensing the body inputprocessing seeing
meaning emotions memory time sense sense of identity evaluation
and cognitive processing motor output and interaction with the
environment

161selfpublished source each of these in his view
could be altered in multiple ways by drugs or other manipulations

 the
components that tart identified have not however been validated by
empirical studies

 research in this area has not yet reached firm
conclusions but a recent questionnairebased study identified eleven
significant factors contributing to druginduced states of
consciousness experience of unity spiritual experience blissful
state insightfulness disembodiment impaired control and cognition
anxiety complex imagery elementary imagery audiovisual synesthesia
and changed meaning of percepts

162

medical aspects

edit

the medical approach to consciousness is scientifically oriented

 it
derives from a need to treat people whose brain function has been
impaired as a result of disease brain damage toxins or drugs

 in
medicine conceptual distinctions are considered useful to the degree
that they can help to guide treatments

 the medical approach focuses
mostly on the amount of consciousness a person has in medicine
consciousness is assessed as a level ranging from coma and brain death
at the low end to full alertness and purposeful responsiveness at the
high end

163

consciousness is of concern to patients and physicians especially
neurologists and anesthesiologists

 patients may have disorders of
consciousness or may need to be anesthetized for a surgical procedure


physicians may perform consciousnessrelated interventions such as
instructing the patient to sleep administering general anesthesia or
inducing medical coma

163 also bioethicists may be concerned with
the ethical implications of consciousness in medical cases of patients
such as the karen ann quinlan case164 while neuroscientists may
study patients with impaired consciousness in hopes of gaining
information about how the brain works

165

assessment

edit

in medicine consciousness is examined using a set of procedures known
as neuropsychological assessment

89 there are two commonly used
methods for assessing the level of consciousness of a patient a simple
procedure that requires minimal training and a more complex procedure
that requires substantial expertise

 the simple procedure begins by
asking whether the patient is able to move and react to physical
stimuli

 if so the next question is whether the patient can respond in
a meaningful way to questions and commands

 if so the patient is asked
for name current location and current day and time

 a patient who can
answer all of these questions is said to be alert and oriented times
four sometimes denoted aox4 on a medical chart and is usually
considered fully conscious

166

the more complex procedure is known as a neurological examination and
is usually carried out by a neurologist in a hospital setting

 a formal
neurological examination runs through a precisely delineated series of
tests beginning with tests for basic sensorimotor reflexes and
culminating with tests for sophisticated use of language

 the outcome
may be summarized using the glasgow coma scale which yields a number in
the range 3–15 with a score of 3 to 8 indicating coma and 15
indicating full consciousness

 the glasgow coma scale has three
subscales measuring the best motor response ranging from no motor
response to obeys commands the best eye response ranging from no
eye opening to eyes opening spontaneously and the best verbal
response ranging from no verbal response to fully oriented

 there
is also a simpler pediatric version of the scale for children too young
to be able to use language

163

in 2013 an experimental procedure was developed to measure degrees of
consciousness the procedure involving stimulating the brain with a
magnetic pulse measuring resulting waves of electrical activity and
developing a consciousness score based on the complexity of the brain
activity

167

disorders

edit

medical conditions that inhibit consciousness are considered disorders
of consciousness

168 this category generally includes minimally
conscious state and persistent vegetative state but sometimes also
includes the less severe lockedin syndrome and more severe chronic
coma

168169 differential diagnosis of these disorders is an
active area of biomedical research

170171172 finally brain
death results in possible irreversible disruption of
consciousness

168 while other conditions may cause a moderate
deterioration e

g

 dementia and delirium or transient interruption
e

g

 grand mal and petit mal seizures of consciousness they are not
included in this category



 
 disorder description
 lockedin syndrome the patient has awareness sleepwake cycles and meaningful behavior viz

 eyemovement but is isolated due to quadriplegia and pseudobulbar palsy


 minimally conscious state the patient has intermittent periods of awareness and wakefulness and displays some meaningful behavior


 persistent vegetative state the patient has sleepwake cycles but lacks awareness and only displays reflexive and nonpurposeful behavior


 chronic coma the patient lacks awareness and sleepwake cycles and only displays reflexive behavior


 brain death the patient lacks awareness sleepwake cycles and brainmediated reflexive behavior


 

medical experts increasingly view anosognosia as a disorder of
consciousness

173 anosognosia is a greekderived term meaning
unawareness of disease

 this is a condition in which patients are
disabled in some way most commonly as a result of a stroke but either
misunderstand the nature of the problem or deny that there is anything
wrong with them

174 the most frequently occurring form is seen in
people who have experienced a stroke damaging the parietal lobe in the
right hemisphere of the brain giving rise to a syndrome known as
hemispatial neglect characterized by an inability to direct action or
attention toward objects located to the left with respect to their
bodies

 patients with hemispatial neglect are often paralyzed on the
left side of the body but sometimes deny being unable to move

 when
questioned about the obvious problem the patient may avoid giving a
direct answer or may give an explanation that does not make sense


patients with hemispatial neglect may also fail to recognize paralyzed
parts of their bodies one frequently mentioned case is of a man who
repeatedly tried to throw his own paralyzed right leg out of the bed he
was lying in and when asked what he was doing complained that somebody
had put a dead leg into the bed with him

 an even more striking type of
anosognosia is anton–babinski syndrome a rarely occurring condition in
which patients become blind but claim to be able to see normally and
persist in this claim in spite of all evidence to the contrary

of the eight types of consciousness in the lycan classification some
are detectable in utero and others develop years after birth


psychologist and educator william foulkes studied children s dreams and
concluded that prior to the shift in cognitive maturation that humans
experience during ages five to seven176 children lack the lockean
consciousness that lycan had labeled introspective consciousness and
that foulkes labels selfreflection

177 in a 2020 paper
katherine nelson and robyn fivush use autobiographical consciousness
to label essentially the same faculty and agree with foulkes on the
timing of this faculty s acquisition

 nelson and fivush contend that
language is the tool by which humans create a new uniquely human form
of consciousness namely autobiographical consciousness

178
julian jaynes had staked out these positions decades
earlier

179180 citing the developmental steps that lead the
infant to autobiographical consciousness nelson and fivush point to the
acquisition of theory of mind calling theory of mind necessary for
autobiographical consciousness and defining it as understanding
differences between one s own mind and others minds in terms of
beliefs desires emotions and thoughts

 they write the hallmark of
theory of mind the understanding of false belief occurs 





 at five to
six years of age

in animals

edit

main article animal consciousness

the topic of animal consciousness is beset by a number of difficulties


it poses the problem of other minds in an especially severe form
because nonhuman animals lacking the ability to express human
language cannot tell humans about their experiences

182 also it
is difficult to reason objectively about the question because a denial
that an animal is conscious is often taken to imply that it does not
feel its life has no value and that harming it is not morally wrong


descartes for example has sometimes been blamed for mistreatment of
animals due to the fact that he believed only humans have a nonphysical
mind

183 most people have a strong intuition that some animals
such as cats and dogs are conscious while others such as insects are
not but the sources of this intuition are not obvious and are often
based on personal interactions with pets and other animals they have
observed

182



thomas nagel argues that while a human might be able to imagine what it
is like to be a bat by taking the bat s point of view it would still
be impossible to know what it is like for a bat to be a bat


townsend s bigeared bat pictured



philosophers who consider subjective experience the essence of
consciousness also generally believe as a correlate that the existence
and nature of animal consciousness can never rigorously be known

 thomas
nagel spelled out this point of view in an influential essay titled
what is it like to be a bat



 he said that an organism is conscious
if and only if there is something that it is like to be that
organism—something it is like for the organism and he argued that no
matter how much we know about an animal s brain and behavior we can
never really put ourselves into the mind of the animal and experience
its world in the way it does itself

184 other thinkers such as
douglas hofstadter dismiss this argument as incoherent

185 several
psychologists and ethologists have argued for the existence of animal
consciousness by describing a range of behaviors that appear to show
animals holding beliefs about things they cannot directly
perceive—donald griffin s 2001 book animal minds reviews a substantial
portion of the evidence

138

on july 7 2012 eminent scientists from different branches of
neuroscience gathered at the university of cambridge to celebrate the
francis crick memorial conference which deals with consciousness in
humans and prelinguistic consciousness in nonhuman animals

 after the
conference they signed in the presence of stephen hawking the
 cambridge declaration on consciousness which summarizes the most
important findings of the survey

we decided to reach a consensus and make a statement directed to the
public that is not scientific

 it s obvious to everyone in this room
that animals have consciousness but it is not obvious to the rest of
the world

 it is not obvious to the rest of the western world or the far
east

 it is not obvious to the society

186

convergent evidence indicates that nonhuman animals 





 including all
mammals and birds and other creatures 





 have the necessary neural
substrates of consciousness and the capacity to exhibit intentional
behaviors

187

in artificial intelligence

edit

main article artificial consciousness

the idea of an artifact made conscious is an ancient theme of mythology
appearing for example in the greek myth of pygmalion who carved a
statue that was magically brought to life and in medieval jewish
stories of the golem a magically animated homunculus built of
clay

188 however the possibility of actually constructing a
conscious machine was probably first discussed by ada lovelace in a set
of notes written in 1842 about the analytical engine invented by charles
babbage a precursor never built to modern electronic computers


lovelace was essentially dismissive of the idea that a machine such as
the analytical engine could think in a humanlike way

 she wrote

 it is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas
 that might arise as to the powers of the analytical engine

 





 the
 analytical engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything


 it can do whatever we know how to order it to perform

 it can follow
 analysis but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations
 or truths

 its province is to assist us in making available what we
 are already acquainted with

189

one of the most influential contributions to this question was an essay
written in 1950 by pioneering computer scientist alan turing titled
computing machinery and intelligence

 turing disavowed any interest in
terminology saying that even can machines think

 is too loaded with
spurious connotations to be meaningful but he proposed to replace all
such questions with a specific operational test which has become known
as the turing test

190 to pass the test a computer must be able to
imitate a human well enough to fool interrogators

 in his essay turing
discussed a variety of possible objections and presented a
counterargument to each of them

 the turing test is commonly cited in
discussions of artificial intelligence as a proposed criterion for
machine consciousness it has provoked a great deal of philosophical
debate

 for example daniel dennett and douglas hofstadter argue that
anything capable of passing the turing test is necessarily
conscious191 while david chalmers argues that a philosophical
zombie could pass the test yet fail to be conscious

192 a third
group of scholars have argued that with technological growth once
machines begin to display any substantial signs of humanlike behavior
then the dichotomy of human consciousness compared to humanlike
consciousness becomes passé and issues of machine autonomy begin to
prevail even as observed in its nascent form within contemporary
industry and technology

6869 jürgen schmidhuber argues that
consciousness is the result of compression

193 as an agent sees
representation of itself recurring in the environment the compression
of this representation can be called consciousness





john searle in december 2005

in a lively exchange over what has come to be referred to as the
chinese room argument john searle sought to refute the claim of
proponents of what he calls strong artificial intelligence ai that a
computer program can be conscious though he does agree with advocates
of weak ai that computer programs can be formatted to simulate
conscious states

 his own view is that consciousness has subjective
firstperson causal powers by being essentially intentional due to the
way human brains function biologically conscious persons can perform
computations but consciousness is not inherently computational the way
computer programs are

 to make a turing machine that speaks chinese
searle imagines a room with one monolingual english speaker searle
himself in fact a book that designates a combination of chinese
symbols to be output paired with chinese symbol input and boxes filled
with chinese symbols

 in this case the english speaker is acting as a
computer and the rulebook as a program

 searle argues that with such a
machine he would be able to process the inputs to outputs perfectly
without having any understanding of chinese nor having any idea what
the questions and answers could possibly mean

 if the experiment were
done in english since searle knows english he would be able to take
questions and give answers without any algorithms for english questions
and he would be effectively aware of what was being said and the
purposes it might serve

 searle would pass the turing test of answering
the questions in both languages but he is only conscious of what he is
doing when he speaks english

 another way of putting the argument is to
say that computer programs can pass the turing test for processing the
syntax of a language but that the syntax cannot lead to semantic
meaning in the way strong ai advocates hoped

194195

in the literature concerning artificial intelligence searle s essay has
been second only to turing s in the volume of debate it has
generated

196 searle himself was vague about what extra ingredients
it would take to make a machine conscious all he proposed was that what
was needed was causal powers of the sort that the brain has and that
computers lack

 but other thinkers sympathetic to his basic argument
have suggested that the necessary though perhaps still not sufficient
extra conditions may include the ability to pass not just the verbal
version of the turing test but the robotic version197 which
requires grounding the robot s words in the robot s sensorimotor
capacity to categorize and interact with the things in the world that
its words are about turingindistinguishably from a real person


turingscale robotics is an empirical branch of research on embodied
cognition and situated cognition

198

in 2014 victor argonov has suggested a nonturing test for machine
consciousness based on a machine s ability to produce philosophical
judgments

199 he argues that a deterministic machine must be
regarded as conscious if it is able to produce judgments on all
problematic properties of consciousness such as qualia or binding
having no innate preloaded philosophical knowledge on these issues no
philosophical discussions while learning and no informational models of
other creatures in its memory such models may implicitly or explicitly
contain knowledge about these creatures consciousness

 however this
test can be used only to detect but not refute the existence of
consciousness

 a positive result proves that a machine is conscious but
a negative result proves nothing

 for example absence of philosophical
judgments may be caused by lack of the machine s intellect not by
absence of consciousness



stream of consciousness

edit

main article stream of consciousness psychology

william james is usually credited with popularizing the idea that human
consciousness flows like a stream in his principles of psychology of
1890



according to james the stream of thought is governed by five
characteristics200

1

 every thought tends to be part of a personal consciousness


2

 within each personal consciousness thought is always changing


3

 within each personal consciousness thought is sensibly continuous


4

 it always appears to deal with objects independent of itself


5

 it is interested in some parts of these objects to the exclusion of
 others



a similar concept appears in buddhist philosophy expressed by the
sanskrit term cittasaṃtāna which is usually translated as mindstream
or mental continuum

 buddhist teachings describe that consciousness
manifests moment to moment as sense impressions and mental phenomena
that are continuously changing

201 the teachings list six triggers
that can result in the generation of different mental events

201
these triggers are input from the five senses seeing hearing
smelling tasting or touch sensations or a thought relating to the
past present or the future that happen to arise in the mind

 the
mental events generated as a result of these triggers are feelings
perceptions and intentionsbehaviour

 the momentbymoment manifestation
of the mindstream is said to happen in every person all the time

 it
even happens in a scientist who analyzes various phenomena in the world
or analyzes the material body including the organ brain

201 the
manifestation of the mindstream is also described as being influenced by
physical laws biological laws psychological laws volitional laws and
universal laws

201 the purpose of the buddhist practice of
mindfulness is to understand the inherent nature of the consciousness
and its characteristics

202

narrative form

edit

in the west the primary impact of the idea has been on literature
rather than science stream of consciousness as a narrative mode means
writing in a way that attempts to portray the momenttomoment thoughts
and experiences of a character

 this technique perhaps had its
beginnings in the monologues of shakespeare s plays and reached its
fullest development in the novels of james joyce and virginia woolf
although it has also been used by many other noted writers

203

here for example is a passage from joyce s ulysses about the thoughts
of molly bloom

 yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his
 breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the city arms hotel when
 he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his
 highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot mrs riordan
 that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing
 all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was
 actually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all
 her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and
 earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first
 god help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits
 and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them i suppose she
 was pious because no man would look at her twice i hope ill never be
 like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a
 welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about mr riordan here
 and mr riordan there i suppose he was glad to get shut of her

204

spiritual approaches

edit

further information higher consciousness

to most philosophers the word consciousness connotes the relationship
between the mind and the world

citation needed to writers on
spiritual or religious topics it frequently connotes the relationship
between the mind and god or the relationship between the mind and
deeper truths that are thought to be more fundamental than the physical
world

citation needed

the canadian psychiatrist richard maurice bucke author of the 1901 book
cosmic consciousness a study in the evolution of the human mind
distinguished between three types of consciousness simple
consciousness awareness of the body possessed by many animals self
consciousness awareness of being aware possessed only by humans and
 cosmic consciousness awareness of the life and order of the universe
possessed only by humans who have attained intellectual enlightenment
or illumination

205thirdparty source needed

another thorough account of the spiritual approach is ken wilber s 1977
book the spectrum of consciousness a comparison of western and eastern
ways of thinking about the mind

 wilber described consciousness as a
spectrum with ordinary awareness at one end and more profound types of
awareness at higher levels
