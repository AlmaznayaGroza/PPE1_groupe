   Consciousness is the individual awareness of your unique thoughts,
   memories, feelings, sensations, and environments. Essentially, your
   consciousness is your awareness of yourself and the world around you.

   This awareness is subjective and unique to you. If you can describe
   something you are experiencing in words, then it is part of your
   consciousness.

   Your conscious experiences are constantly shifting and changing. For
   example, in one moment, you may be focused on reading this article.
   Your consciousness may then shift to the memory of a conversation you
   had earlier with a co-worker. Next, you might notice how uncomfortable
   your chair is, or maybe you are mentally planning dinner.

   This ever-shifting stream of thoughts can change dramatically from one
   moment to the next, but your experience of it seems smooth and
   effortless.

States of Consciousness

   The various states of consciousness include:
     * Dreams
     * Hallucinations
     * Hypnosis
     * Meditation
     * Sleep
     * States induced by psychoactive drugs

   The two normal states of awareness are consciousness and
   unconsciousness. Higher states of consciousness are often associated
   with spiritual or mystical experiences. It involves an elevated state
   of awareness where people are able to gain a greater sense of
   themselves, their role, and the world. Examples of this include
   transcendence, meditation, mindfulness, a "runner's high," lucid
   dreaming, and flow states.

   Altered levels of consciousness also can occur, which may be caused by
   medical or mental conditions that impair or change awareness.  Altered
   types of consciousness include:
     * Coma
     * Confusion
     * Delirium
     * Disorientation
     * Lethargy
     * Stupor

   Doctors and healthcare professionals use various assessments to measure
   and assess levels of consciousness. They use scores on these
   assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment decisions.

What Are the 5 Levels of Consciousness?

   Conscious: Everything you are aware of

   Preconscious: Information you are not currently aware of that you can
   pull into awareness if needed

   Unconscious: Memories that are outside of awareness and inaccessible

   Non-conscious: Automatically bodily functions that occur without
   awareness and sensation

   Subconscious: Information that is out of consciousness and not
   immediately available to consciousness
   What Is the Unconscious Mind?

Functions of Consciousness

   Consciousness has several biological and social purposes. For example,
   it allows us to process information, choose our actions, set
   priorities, learn and adapt to new information, make decisions, and
   more.

   Consciousness is an essential state in philosophy, spirituality, and
   religion. All of these require self-awareness, which is impossible
   without consciousness.

Changes in Consciousness

   Understanding different levels of consciousness can help healthcare
   professionals spot signs that someone might be experiencing a problem.
   Some of these changes occur naturally; others are the result of factors
   such as drugs or brain damage. Changes to consciousness also can cause
   changes to perception, thinking, understanding, and interpretations of
   the world.

   Changes in consciousness can sometimes be a sign of medical conditions
   or they may even be a sign of an immediate medical emergency.

   For example, sudden changes in consciousness might be a sign of:
     * Aneurysm
     * Brain infections
     * Brain tumor or injury
     * Dementia or Alzheimer's disease
     * Drug use
     * Epilepsy
     * Heart disease
     * Heatstroke
     * Lack of oxygen to the brain
     * Low blood sugar
     * Poisoning
     * Shock
     * Stroke

When to Seek Help

   If you thinking you are experiencing changes in consciousness, talk to
   your doctor. Sudden changes may be a sign of a medical emergency that
   requires immediate attention, such as a stroke or hemorrhage.

   Talking to your doctor right away can ensure that you get immediate
   treatment before problems get worse.

History of Consciousness

   For thousands of years, the study of human consciousness was largely
   the work of philosophers. The French philosopher Rene Descartes
   introduced the concept of mind-body dualism or the idea that while the
   mind and body are separate, they do interact.

   Once psychology was established as a discipline separate from
   philosophy and biology, the study of the conscious experience became
   one of the first topics studied by early psychologists.

   Structuralists used a process known as introspection to analyze and
   report conscious sensations, thoughts, and experiences. Trained
   observers would carefully inspect the contents of their own minds.
   Obviously, this was a very subjective process, but it helped inspire
   further research on the scientific study of consciousness.

   The American psychologist William James compared consciousness to a
   stream—unbroken and continuous despite constant shifts and changes.
   Psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud focused on understanding the importance of
   the unconscious and conscious mind.

   While the focus of much of the research in psychology shifted to purely
   observable behaviors during the first half of the 20th century,
   research on human consciousness has grown tremendously since the 1950s.

Theories of Consciousness

   One of the problems with the study of consciousness is the lack of a
   universally accepted operational definition. Descartes proposed the
   idea of cogito ergo sum ("I think, therefore I am"), which suggested
   that the very act of thinking demonstrates the reality of one’s
   existence and consciousness.

   Today, consciousness is generally defined as an awareness of yourself
   and the world. However, there are still debates about the different
   aspects of this awareness.

   Research on consciousness has focused on understanding the neuroscience
   behind our conscious experiences. Scientists have even utilized
   brain-scanning technology to seek out specific neurons that might be
   linked to different conscious events. Modern researchers have proposed
   two major theories of consciousness: integrated information theory and
   global workspace theory.

Integrated Information Theory

   This approach looks at consciousness by learning more about the
   physical processes that underlie our conscious experiences. The theory
   attempts to create a measure of the integrated information that forms
   consciousness. The quality of an organism’s consciousness is
   represented by the level of integration.

   This theory tends to focus on whether something is conscious and to
   what degree it is conscious.

Global Workspace Theory

   This theory suggests that we have a memory bank from which the brain
   draws information to form the experience of conscious awareness.﻿﻿
   While integrated information theory focuses more on identifying whether
   an organism is conscious, the global workspace theory offers a much
   broader approach to understanding how consciousness works.
   The Different States of Consciousness

Summary

   While consciousness has intrigued philosophers and scientists for
   thousands of years, experts clearly have a long way to go in our
   understanding of the concept. Researchers continue to explore the
   different bases of consciousness including the physical, social,
   cultural, and psychological influences that contribute to our conscious
   awareness.
