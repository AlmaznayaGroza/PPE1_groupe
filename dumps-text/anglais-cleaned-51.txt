the universal mind or universal consciousness is a metaphysical
concept suggesting an underlying essence of all beings and becoming in
the universe

 it includes the being and becoming that occurred in the
universe prior to the emergence of the concept of mind a term that more
appropriately refers to the organic human aspect of universal
consciousness

 it addresses inorganic being and becoming and the
interactions that occur in that process without specific reference to
the physical and chemical laws that try to describe those interactions


those interactions have occurred do occur and continue to occur


universal consciousness is the source that underlies those interactions
and the awareness and knowledge they imply



introduction

edit

the concept of the universal mind was presented by anaxagoras a
presocratic philosopher who arrived in athens some time after 480 bc


he taught that the growth of living things depends on the power of mind
within the organisms that enables them to extract nourishment from
surrounding substances

 for this concept of mind anaxagoras was
commended by aristotle

 both plato and aristotle however objected that
his notion of mind did not include a view that mind acts ethically
i

e

 acts for the “best interests” of the universe



the most original aspect of anaxagoras s system was his doctrine of nous
mind or reason

 a different greek word gnósi knowledge better
reflects what is observed in the wider world of organic and inorganic
beings than just the human world



chu ch an says “the universal mind therefore is something to which
nothing can be attributed

 being absolute goes beyond attributes

 if
for example it were to be described as infinite that would exclude
from it whatever is finite but the whole argument of the book is that
the universal mind is the only reality and that everything we apprehend
through our senses is nothing else but this mind

 even to think of it in
terms of existence or nonexistence is to misapprehend it entirely

” pp


8–9

the term surfaced again in later philosophy as in the writings of
hegel

 hegel writes

 ¤ 377 the knowledge of mind is the highest and hardest just because
 it is the most concrete of sciences

 the significance of that
 absolute commandment know thyself − whether we look at it in itself
 or under the historical circumstances of its first utterance − is not
 to promote mere self−knowledge in respect of the particular
 capacities character propensities and foibles of the single self


 the knowledge it commands means that of man s genuine reality − of
 what is essentially and ultimately true and real − of mind as the true
 and essential being

” 4

descriptions

edit

there are no definitions of the universal mind but two authors within
the new thought movement offer vague descriptions in superlatives such
as omnipotence



ernest holmes the founder of the science of mind movement

 the universal mind contains any knowledge

 it is the potential
 ultimate of any thing

 to it things are possible

1

new thought author charles haanel said of the universal mind and its
relationship to humans

 the universal mind has unlimited resources at its command and when we
 remember that it is also omnipresent we cannot escape the conclusion
 that we must be a manifestation of that mind

2

the nature of the universal mind is said to be omnipresent
