The
New
Grown-Up


There’s
been
a
fundamental
shift
in
how
we
define
adulthood—and
at

what
pace
it
occurs
.


PT’s
authors
consider
how
a
once
iron-clad

construct
is
now
up
for
grabs—and
what
it
means
for
young
people’s

mental
health
today

Key
points

-
Consciousness
is
the
active
and
subjective
experiencing
aspect
of
an

experience
.


-
Consciousness
is
what
transforms
a
biochemical
state
into
an

experience
.


-
Although
we
have
mapped
brain
activity
to
specific
conscious

perceptions
,
we
still
don
'
t
know
how
this
gives
rise
to
conscious

experiences
.



Consciousness
is
what
we
are
most
familiar
with
.


Feeling
the
sun
'
s
warmth
on
our
face
,
the
joy
of
seeing
someone
we
love
,
or
the
thrill
of
being
on
a
rollercoaster—every
single
experience
we
ever
had
,
from
sensations
to
thoughts
and
emotions
,
is
linked
to
consciousness
.


It
seems
paradoxical
,
but
despite
being
at
the
centre
of
every
experience
,
consciousness
is
difficult
to
define
and
still
poorly
understood
scientifically
.



We
know
more
about
distant
galaxies
and
the
deepest
ocean
regions
than
we
do
about
our
consciousness
.


Even
though
consciousness
has
been
discussed
by
philosophers
for
millennia
and
has
become
an
active
and
thriving
field
of
scientific
research
,
it
remains
largely
a
mystery–but
a
strange
mystery
,
one
that
we
may
not
understand
well
but
are
intimately
acquainted
with
.



So
,
what
exactly
is
consciousness
?


Many
have
tried
to
answer
this
seemingly
simple
question
(I
will
cover
most
of
the
influential
views
on
this
blog)
,
but
a
universally
agreed-upon
definition
still
seems
elusive
.


Let’s
start
our
exploration
with
a
trip
to
the
dentist
.



Experiencing
an
Experience

Local
anesthesia
can
make
dental
surgery
a
lot
more
bearable
.


Specialised
neurons
that
detect
pain
called
nociceptors
still
respond
even
when
under
local
anesthesia
and
try
to
send
out
signals
to
alert
the
brain
to
tissue
damage
inside
the
mouth
.


While
some
local
anesthetics
reduce
nociceptor
activity
,
many
function
by
blocking
these
signals
from
being
passed
on
so
that
the
message
never
reaches
the
brain
(another
example
of
this
is
spinal
epidural
anesthesia
,
where
the
signaling
pathway
is
blocked
in
the
spinal
cord
rather
than
at
the
source
nociceptors
;
Olschewski
et
al
.


,
1998)
.


The
tissue
damage
in
the
mouth
is
simply
a
biological
state
,
and
any
nociceptor
response
is
just
a
biochemical
reaction
,
an
event
,
or
an
occurrence
without
any
associated
experience
.



When
we
bite
into
a
juicy
apple
(after
recovering
from
our
dental
surgery)
,
our
minds
cannot
directly
interact
with
the
apple
.


Whatever
the
mind
may
be
,
it
cannot
directly
taste
the
sweetness
,
sense
the
crunchy
texture
,
or
smell
the
chemicals
released
into
the
air
.


We
need
the
complex
sensory
machinery
inside
our
bodies
to
pick
up
on
these
things
,
encode
them
into
neural
signals
,
and
send
them
to
the
brain
.


When
the
upward
signaling
is
interrupted
(like
it
was
by
the
local
anesthesia
at
the
dentist)
,
all
of
this
is
merely
a
physiological
state
or
a
unique
biochemical
configuration
of
our
bodies
.



However
,
if
these
signals
reach
our
brains
when
awake
and
focused
,
something
extraordinary
happens
:
The
biological
signals
trigger
a
subjective
conscious
experience
.


We
still
don’t
know
much
about
how
or
why
this
happens
,
but
consciousness
lives
on
as
an
indisputable
aspect
of
our
minds
.


Although
mysterious
,
it
is
also
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
meaningful
aspects
of
our
human
experience
:
It
makes
life
worth
living
and
gives
us
an
innate
sense
of
value
and
worth
.


There
are
no
laws
against
throwing
a
rock
but
very
strict
laws
against
throwing
rocks
at
a
human
being
.



The
simple
reason
is
that
unlike
rocks—as
far
as
we
know—human
beings
have
the
capacity
to
experience
both
pain
and
joy
.


All
human
rights
and
the
famous
unalienable
right
to
life
,
liberty
,
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
,
found
in
the
U
.

S
.


Declaration
of
Independence
,
are
based
on
the
human
capacity
to
have
experiences
.


Consciousness
is
the
basis
for
our
experiences
and
undergirds
all
of
this
.



In
its
most
basic
sense
,
consciousness
is
linked
to
experience
.


In
a
way
,
it
turns
a
state
of
the
world
or
a
specific
configuration
of
atoms
,
molecules
,
organs
,
and
everything
else
into
an
experience
.


Another
way
to
look
at
it
is
as
the
active
experiencing
of
an
experience
.

Towards
Neural
Correlate
and
Back
to
Experience

Several
decades
of
thriving
research
have
uncovered
much
of
what
lies
behind
our
conscious
experiences
,
such
as
the
complex
and
intricate
brain
processes
required
to
piece
together
what
we
sense
coherently
.


Even
decoding
a
sound
'
s
origin
in
three-dimensional
space
requires
complex
computation
within
a
specialised
neural
architecture
.


Yet
,
we
are
not
directly
aware
of
any
of
these
myriad
operations
that
are
going
on
behind
the
scenes
and
effortlessly
turn
toward
the
direction
of
a
loud
sound
.


These
fascinating
insights
can
describe
the
brain
activity
associated
with
specific
conscious
perception
forms
in
great
detail
.


We
already
have
a
rich
catalogue
of
such
neural
correlates
,
and
new
findings
are
frequently
added
.



The
problem
is
that
while
neural
correlates
highlight
the
brain’s
necessary
work
in
the
background
that
makes
specific
conscious
experiences
possible
,
they
fail
to
explain
such
experiences
themselves
.


The
processes
are
unconscious
,
and
even
the
results
can
often
be
unconscious
,
like
when
we
are
distracted
or
when
a
stronger
stimulus
overrides
another
.


In
those
cases
,
the
exact
same
processes
do
not
result
in
a
conscious
experience
.



A
rollercoaster
can
provide
a
thrilling
ride
,
but
if
it
runs
empty
with
no
one
riding
it
,
no
thrill
is
experienced
.


This
does
not
mean
that
there
is
a
little
person
inside
watching
the
“theatre
of
the
mind”—what
the
British
philosopher
Gilbert
Ryle
(1949/2002)
mockingly
called
“the
dogma
of
the
Ghost
in
the
Machine
.

”
A
majority
of
scientists
and
philosophers
reject
this
notion
.


However
,
it
does
mean
that
even
though
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
are
incredibly
useful
,
they
don’t
fully
explain
what
consciousness
is
.

5
Things
About
the
Brain
You
Probably
Didn
'
t
Know

Anil
Seth
,
one
of
the
leading
researchers
in
this
field
,
suggests
that
the
ultimate
(or
what
he
calls
the
“real
question
of
consciousness”)
is
answering
why
a
particular
brain
activity
results
in
a
specific
conscious
experience
and
not
merely
establishing
that
it
does
(Seth
,
2021)
.



Experiences
need
explaining
beyond
their
mechanistic
underpinnings
.


Some
philosophers
have
gone
as
far
as
to
suggest
that
what
is
experienced
is
an
illusion
(Frankish
,
2016)
.


Yet
,
even
in
this
extreme
scenario
,
if
the
content
of
an
experience
is
truly
illusionary
(which
few
accept)
,
the
experience
itself
would
still
be
real
.


Any
philosophical
,
psychological
,
or
neurobiological
theory
of
consciousness
is
incomplete
without
a
full
account
of
experiences
,
which
brings
us
back
to
the
act
of
experiencing
.



What
exactly
is
consciousness
?



So
,
what
exactly
is
consciousness
?


It
is
what
we
are
most
familiar
with
and
what
undergirds
every
perception
,
emotion
,
and
thought
we
have
.


At
the
same
time
,
it
is
an
elusive
notion
that
is
difficult
to
define
.


I
would
suggest
that
it
is
linked
to
experiences
:
It
is
the
subjective
and
active
aspect
,
the
experiencing
of
an
experience
.
