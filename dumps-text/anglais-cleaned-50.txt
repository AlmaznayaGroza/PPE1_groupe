is consciousness part of the fabric of the universe



a theory called panpsychism proposes that consciousness is a fundamental
aspect of reality

more than 400 years ago galileo showed that many everyday
phenomena—such as a ball rolling down an incline or a chandelier gently
swinging from a church ceiling—obey precise mathematical laws

 for this
insight he is often hailed as the founder of modern science

 but
galileo recognized that not everything was amenable to a quantitative
approach

 such things as colors tastes and smells “are no more than
mere names” galileo declared for “they reside only in consciousness

”
these qualities aren t really out there in the world he asserted but
exist only in the minds of creatures that perceive them

 “hence if the
living creature were removed” he wrote “all these qualities would be
wiped away and annihilated

”

since galileo s time the physical sciences have leaped forward
explaining the workings of the tiniest quarks to the largest galaxy
clusters

 but explaining things that reside “only in consciousness”—the
red of a sunset say or the bitter taste of a lemon—has proven far more
difficult

 neuroscientists have identified a number of neural correlates
of consciousness—brain states associated with specific mental states—but
have not explained how matter forms minds in the first place

 as
philosopher colin mcginn put it in a 1989 paper “somehow we feel the
water of the physical brain is turned into the wine of consciousness

”
philosopher david chalmers famously dubbed this quandary the “hard
problem” of consciousness



scholars recently gathered to debate the problem at marist college in
poughkeepsie n

y

 during a twoday workshop focused on an idea known
as panpsychism

 the concept proposes that consciousness is a fundamental
aspect of reality like mass or electrical charge

 the idea goes back to
antiquity—plato took it seriously—and has had some prominent supporters
over the years including psychologist william james and philosopher and
mathematician bertrand russell

 lately it is seeing renewed interest
especially following the 2019 publication of philosopher philip goff s
book galileo s error which argues forcefully for the idea



goff of the university of durham in england organized the recent event
along with marist philosopher andrei buckareff and it was funded
through a grant from the john templeton foundation

 in a small lecture
hall with floortoceiling windows overlooking the hudson river roughly
two dozen scholars probed the possibility that perhaps it s
consciousness all the way down



part of the appeal of panpsychism is that it appears to provide a
workaround to the question posed by chalmers we no longer have to worry
about how inanimate matter forms minds because mindedness was there all
along residing in the fabric of the universe

 chalmers himself has
embraced a form of panpsychism and even suggested that individual
particles might be somehow aware

 he said in a ted talk that a photon
“might have some element of raw subjective feeling some primitive
precursor to consciousness

” also on board with the idea is
neuroscientist christof koch who noted in his 2012 book consciousness
that if one accepts consciousness as a real phenomenon that s not
dependent on any particular material—that it s “substrateindependent”
as philosophers put it—then “it is a simple step to conclude that the
entire cosmos is suffused with sentience

”

yet panpsychism runs counter to the majority view in both the physical
sciences and in philosophy that treats consciousness as an emergent
phenomenon something that arises in certain complex systems such as
human brains

 in this view individual neurons are not conscious but
thanks to the collective properties of some 86 billion neurons and their
interactions—which admittedly are still only poorly understood—brains
along with bodies perhaps are conscious

 surveys suggest that
slightly more than half of academic philosophers hold this view known
as “physicalism” or “emergentism” whereas about one third reject
physicalism and lean toward some alternative of which panpsychism is
one of several possibilities



at the workshop goff made the case that physics has missed something
essential when it comes to our inner mental life

 in formulating their
theories “most physicists think about experiments” he said

 “i think
they should be thinking is my theory compatible with
consciousness

 —because we know that s real

”

many philosophers at the meeting appeared to share goff s concern that
physicalism falters when it comes to consciousness

 “if you know every
last detail about my brain processes you still wouldn t know what it s
like to be me” says hedda hassel mørch a philosopher at inland norway
university of applied sciences

 “there is a clear explanatory gap
between the physical and the mental

” consider for example the
difficulty of trying to describe color to someone who has only seen the
world in black and white

 yanssel garcia a philosopher at the
university of nebraska omaha believes that physical facts alone are
inadequate for such a task

 “there is nothing of a physical sort that
you could provide a person who sees only in shades of gray in order to
have them understand what color experience is like they would need to
experience it themselves” he says

 “physical science is in principle
incapable of telling us the complete story

” of the various alternatives
that have been put forward he says that “panpsychism is our best bet

”

but panpsychism attracts many critics as well

 some point out that it
doesn t explain how small bits of consciousness come together to form
more substantive conscious entities

 detractors say that this puzzle
known as the “combination problem” amounts to panpsychism s own version
of the hard problem

 the combination problem “is the serious challenge
for the panpsychist position” goff admits

 “and it s where most of our
energies are going

”

others question panpsychism s explanatory power

 in his 2021 book being
you neuroscientist anil seth wrote that the main problems with
panpsychism are that “it doesn t really explain anything and that it
doesn t lead to testable hypotheses

 it s an easy getout to the
apparent mystery posed by the hard problem

”

while most of those invited to the workshop were philosophers there
were also talks by physicists sean carroll and lee smolin and by
cognitive psychologist donald hoffman

 carroll a hardcore physicalist
served as an unofficial leader of the opposition as the workshop
unfolded

 he occasionally quipped “i m surrounded by panpsychists

”
during a wellattended public debate between goff and carroll the
divergence of their worldviews quickly became apparent

 goff said that
physicalism has led “precisely nowhere” and suggested that the very
idea of trying to explain consciousness in physical terms was
incoherent

 carroll argued that physicalism is actually doing quite well
and that although consciousness is one of many phenomena that can t be
inferred from the goingson at the microscopic level it is nonetheless
a real emergent feature of the macroscopic world

 he offered the
physics of gases as a parallel example

 at the micro level one talks of
atoms molecules and forces at the macro level one speaks of pressure
volume and temperature

 these are two kinds of explanations depending
on the “level” being studied—but present no great mystery and are not a
failure on the part of physics

 before long goff and carroll were deep
into the weeds of the socalled knowledge argument also known as “mary
in the black and white room” as well as the “zombie” argument


both boil down to the same key question is there something about
consciousness that cannot be accounted for by physical facts alone

 much
of the rhetorical pingpong between goff and carroll amounted to goff
answering yes to that question and carroll answering no



another objection some attendees raised is that panpsychism doesn t
address what philosophers call the “other minds” problem

 you have
direct access to your own mind—but how can you deduce anything at all
about another person s mind

 “even if panpsychism is true there will
still be vast amounts of things—namely things related to what the
experiences of others are like—that we still won t know” says rebecca
chan a philosopher at san josé state university

 she worries that
invoking an underlying layer of mindedness is a bit like invoking god


“i sometimes wonder if the panpsychist position is similar to god of
the gaps arguments” she says referring to the notion that god is
needed to fill the gaps in scientific knowledge



other ideas were batted around

 the idea of cosmopsychism was
floated—roughly the notion that the universe itself is conscious

 and
paul draper a philosopher at purdue university who participated via
zoom talked about a subtly different idea known as “psychological ether
theory”—essentially that brains don t produce consciousness but rather
make use of consciousness

 in this view consciousness was already there
before brains existed like an allpervasive ether

 if the idea is
correct he writes “then in all likelihood god exists

”

hoffman a cognitive scientist at the university of california irvine
who also addressed the workshop via zoom advocates rejecting the idea
of spacetime and looking for something deeper

 he cited the
increasingly popular idea in physics lately that space and time may not
be fundamental but may instead be emergent phenomena themselves

 the
deeper entity related to consciousness hoffman suggests may consist of
“subjects and experiences” that he says “are entities beyond spacetime
not within spacetime

” he developed this idea in a 2023 paper entitled
“fusions of consciousness

”

smolin a physicist at the perimeter institute for theoretical physics
in ontario who also participated via zoom has similarly been working
on theories that appear to offer a more central role for conscious
agents

 in a 2020 paper he suggested that the universe “is composed of
a set of partial views of itself” and that “conscious perceptions are
aspects of some views”—a perspective that he says can be thought of as
“a restricted form of panpsychism

”

carroll speaking after the session that included both hoffman and
smolin noted that his own views diverged from those of the speakers
within the first couple of minutes

 over lunch he noted that attending
the workshop sometimes felt like being on a subreddit for fans of a tv
show that you re just not into

 he admitted that endless debates over
the nature of “reality” sometimes left him frustrated

 “people ask me
 what is physical reality

 it s physical reality

 there s nothing that
it is

 what do you want me to say that it s made of macaroni or
something

” even carroll however admits that there s more to reality
than meets the eye

 he s a strong supporter of the “many worlds”
interpretation of quantum mechanics which holds that our universe is
just one facet of a vast quantum multiverse



if all of this sounds like it couldn t possibly have any practical
value goff raised the possibility that how we conceive of minds can
have ethical implications

 take the question of whether fish feel pain


traditional science can only study a fish s outward behavior not its
mental state

 to goff focusing on the fish s behavior is not only
wrongheaded but “horrific” because it leaves out what s actually most
important—what the fish actually feels

 “we re going to stop asking if
fish are conscious and just look at their behavior

 who gives a shit
about the behavior

 i want to know if it has an inner life that s all
that matters

” for physicalists such as carroll however feelings and
behavior are intimately linked—which means we can avoid causing an
animal to suffer by not putting it in a situation where it appears to be
suffering based on its behavior

 “if there were no connection between
them behavior and feelings we would indeed be in trouble” says
carroll “but that s not our world

”

seth the neuroscientist was not at the workshop—but i asked him where
he stands in the debate over physicalism and its various alternatives


physicalism he says still offers more “empirical grip” than its
competitors—and he laments what he sees as excessive handwringing over
its alleged failures including the supposed hardness of the hard
problem

 “critiquing physicalism on the basis that it has failed is
willful mischaracterization” he says

 “it s doing just fine as
progress in consciousness science readily attests

” in a recently
published article in the journal of consciousness studies seth adds
“asserting that consciousness is fundamental and ubiquitous does nothing
to shed light on the way an experience of blueness is the way it is and
not some other way

 nor does it explain anything about the possible
functions of consciousness nor why consciousness is lost in states such
as dreamless sleep general anaesthesia and coma

”

even those who lean toward panpsychism sometimes seem hesitant to dive
into the deep end

 as garcia put it in spite of the allure of a
universe imbued with consciousness “i would love to be talked out of
it
