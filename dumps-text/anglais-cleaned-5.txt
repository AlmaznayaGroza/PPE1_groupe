 how to form a moral conscience 

 

 

  

 what is a moral conscience



    according to the catechism of the catholic church a human
 person “has in his heart a law inscribed by god” “calling him
 to love

”  this is a person s moral conscience

 1776

    in their document forming consciences for faithful
 citizenship the u

s

 bishops said conscience is not something
 that allows us to justify doing whatever we want nor is it a
 mere feeling about what we should or should not do

 rather
 conscience is the voice of god resounding in the human heart
 revealing the truth to us and calling us to do what is good
 while shunning what is evil

”
    the moral conscience urges a person “to do good and avoid
 evil” it also judges particular choices approving those which
 are good and disapproving those which are evil

 catechism of
 the catholic church 1777  our conscience enables us to
 understand the principles of morality decide how to apply those
 principles in specific circumstances and judge the moral status
 of concrete acts

 1780
    the human person has the right to act in conscience and in
 freedom and “must always obey the certain judgment of his
 conscience

” 1782 1790
    the catechism says a person s moral conscience must be
 informed and enlightened so that it “formulates its judgments
 according to reason and in conformity with the true good
 willed by god

 1783  shaping a wellformed conscience is a
 lifelong task which is rooted in the word of god assisted by
 the gifts of the holy spirit aided by the witness or advice of
 others and guided by the authoritative teaching of the
 church

17841785


    ignorance of christ and his gospel bad example by others
 enslavement to one s passions a mistaken notion of autonomy
 rejection of the church s authority or teaching lack of
 conversion or charity may all be a source of errors in moral
 judgment

  one must therefore work to correct the errors of
 moral conscience

 1792 1793
    the catechism says that individuals are “sometimes confronted
 by situations that make moral judgments less assured and
 decision difficult

”  in such situations a person “must always
 seriously seek what is right and good and discern the will of
 god expressed in divine law

”1787  in this effort a person
 “strives to interpret the data of experience and the signs of
 the times” with the assistance of “the virtue of prudence the
 advice of competent people and the help of the holy
 spirit

”1788

 how to form a moral conscience

 here are some guidelines for how to form a moral conscience
 particularly in a situation where you may misunderstand or
 disagree with a specific truth or teaching of the church
 • consult with a pastor pastoral staff member or spiritual
 guide who understands and can explain the church s teaching
 clearly and correctly

  identify the fundamental truths or
 values on which this teaching is based and determine how
 essential this teaching is to the core of catholic faith


 beware of making decisions based on information you read in
 books or online which may not accurately explain the church s
 teaching


 • assume that the church s understanding of god s revelation and
 human nature is fuller deeper and more reliable than any
 individual s


 even though the church s teaching may seem ideal unrealistic or
 wrong to you start from the assumption that it is correct and
 applies to your personal circumstances


   
 • evaluate your personal opinions feelings and circumstances
 carefully

  honestly assess the reasons why you are unable or
 unwilling to agree or comply with the church s teaching

  
 this is best done with the assistance of an trusted companion
 such as a pastor confessor or spiritual guide who understands
 the church s teaching as well as your personal circumstances


 • pray for the grace to understand and appreciate the underlying
 truth or values which are reflected in the church s teaching and
 for the grace to discern what is possible for you in your
 particular circumstances


 be patient and allow time for god s inspiration to guide you
 directly or through others who know and love you


 • consult with your pastor a confessor or reliable spiritual
 guide before making a final decision

  the goal here is to
 determine to what extent you can or cannot understand or follow
 the church s teaching

  to what extent is it possible to honor
 the teaching in part

  to what extent is it possible to honor
 the underlying truth or value which is reflected in the
 teaching


 • continue to pray for the grace to understand or comply with
 the church s teaching more fully in spite of your personal
 circumstances

  pray for the grace to appreciate and honor the
 underlying truth or value reflected in a particular teaching


 be open to changing your decision as your understanding or
 circumstances change


 • consult with your pastor a confessor or reliable spiritual
 guide if you are troubled by your decision


 • remember that god knows you are an imperfect and sinful person
 and loves you nonetheless

  
 trust in god s mercy and love even if after careful
 discernment your decision does not agree with the church s
 teaching


 if we decide that we cannot understand or comply completely with
 the church s teaching we should avoid coming to the conclusion
 that the church must be wrong

  although at times prophetic
 individuals and groups within the church come to different
 conclusions which the church officially accepts at a later date
 most of us are not prophets


 if we are led by a morally responsible conscience to believe or
 act in a way which is contrary to what the church teaches at the
 present time we should continue to assume that the church is
 correct and that for more or less legitimate reasons i am unable
 or unwilling to agree or comply

  we should continue to
 participate as fully as possible in the sacramental and
 spiritual life of the catholic church being careful not to give
 scandal to others who may be confused by our belief or behavior


 if we are led by a morally responsible conscience to believe or
 act in a way which is contrary to what the church teaches at the
 present time we should do so with a spirit of humility and
 respect a desire to remain in communion with the catholic faith
 community and the intention to believe and obey as fully as
 possible in what the church believes and teaches


 we should proceed cautiously and with patience aware of our own
 limitations and sinfulness always desiring to be transformed by
 god s love and mercy
