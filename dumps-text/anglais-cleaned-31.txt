Freedom
of

1
.


Everyone
has
the
right
to
freedom
of
thought
,
conscience
and
religion
.


This
right
includes
freedom
to
change
religion
or
belief
and
freedom
,
either
alone
or
in
community
with
others
and
in
public
or
in
private
,
to
manifest
religion
or
belief
,
in
worship
,
teaching
,
practice
and
observance
.


2
.


The
right
to
conscientious
objection
is
recognised
,
in
accordance
with
the
national
laws
governing
the
exercise
of
this
right
.



Explanations

-
Text
:

The
right
guaranteed
in
paragraph
1
corresponds
to
the
right

guaranteed
in
Article
9
of
the
ECHR
and
,
in
accordance
with
Article

52(3)
of
the
Charter
,
has
the
same
meaning
and
scope
.


Limitations

must
therefore
respect
Article
9(2)
of
the
Convention
,
which
reads

as
follows
:
"Freedom
to
manifest
one
'
s
religion
or
beliefs
shall
be

subject
only
to
such
limitations
as
are
prescribed
by
law
and
are

necessary
in
a
democratic
society
in
the
interests
of
public
safety
,

for
the
protection
of
public
order
,
health
or
morals
,
or
for
the

protection
of
the
rights
and
freedoms
of
others
.

"


The
right
guaranteed
in
paragraph
2
corresponds
to
national

constitutional
traditions
and
to
the
development
of
national

legislation
on
this
issue
.

Preamble
-
Explanations
relating
to
the
Charter
of
Fundamental

Rights
:

These
explanations
were
originally
prepared
under
the
authority
of

the
Praesidium
of
the
Convention
which
drafted
the
Charter
of

Fundamental
Rights
of
the
European
Union
.


Although
they
do
not
as

such
have
the
status
of
law
,
they
are
a
valuable
tool
of

interpretation
intended
to
clarify
the
provisions
of
the
Charter
.

(18)
Derogation
from
stunning
in
case
of
religious
slaughter
taking

place
in
slaughterhouses
was
granted
by
Directive
93/119/EC
.


Since

Community
provisions
applicable
to
religious
slaughter
have
been

transposed
differently
depending
on
national
contexts
and

considering
that
national
rules
take
into
account
dimensions
that
go

beyond
the
purpose
of
this
Regulation
,
it
is
important
that

derogation
from
stunning
animals
prior
to
slaughter
should
be

maintained
,
leaving
,
however
,
a
certain
level
of
subsidiarity
to

each
Member
State
.


As
a
consequence
,
this
Regulation
respects
the

freedom
of
religion
and
the
right
to
manifest
religion
or
belief
in

worship
,
teaching
,
practice
and
observance
,
as
enshrined
in
Article

10
of
the
Charter
of
Fundamental
Rights

of
Antisemitism


Antisemitism
is
still
a
reality
for
many
Jewish
people
in
the
EU

today
.


Faced
with
prejudice
and
hostility
,
most
feel
unable
to
live

openly
Jewish
lives
.


This
report
presents
the
results
of
FRA’s
third

EU
survey
of
Jewish
people’s
experiences
and
perceptions
of

antisemitism
.


The
survey
took
place
before
the
Hamas
attacks
in

October
2023
and
the
war
in
Gaza
;
however
,
it
includes
evidence
from

a
consultation
with
national
and
European
Jewish
umbrella

organisations
since
.


It
covers
13
EU
Member
States
that
together

account
for
around
96
%
of
the
EU’s
Jewish
population
.

Artificial

Artificial
intelligence
is
everywhere
and
affects
everyone
–
from

deciding
what
content
people
see
on
their
social

feeds
to

determining
who
will

state

.


AI

typically

even
