explanations

 text
 the right guaranteed in paragraph 1 corresponds to the right
 guaranteed in article 9 of the echr and in accordance with article
 523 of the charter has the same meaning and scope

 limitations

 as follows freedom to manifest one s religion or beliefs shall be
 subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are
 necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety
 for the protection of public order health or morals or for the

 the right guaranteed in paragraph 2 corresponds to national
 constitutional traditions and to the development of national
 legislation on this issue

 preamble explanations relating to the charter of fundamental
 rights
 these explanations were originally prepared under the authority of
 the praesidium of the convention which drafted the charter of
 fundamental rights of the european union

 although they do not as
 such have the status of law they are a valuable tool of
 interpretation intended to clarify the provisions of the charter

 council regulation ec no 10992009 of 24 september 2009 on the
 protection of animals at the time of killing

 







 18 derogation from stunning in case of religious slaughter taking
 place in slaughterhouses was granted by directive 93119ec

 since
 community provisions applicable to religious slaughter have been
 transposed differently depending on national contexts and
 considering that national rules take into account dimensions that go
 beyond the purpose of this regulation it is important that
 derogation from stunning animals prior to slaughter should be
 maintained leaving however a certain level of subsidiarity to
 each member state

 as a consequence this regulation respects the
 freedom of religion and the right to manifest religion or belief in
 worship teaching practice and observance as enshrined in article
 10 of the charter of fundamental rights of the european union
