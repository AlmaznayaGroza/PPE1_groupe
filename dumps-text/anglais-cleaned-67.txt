abstract

consciousness can be defined by two components arousal wakefulness
and awareness subjective experience

 however neurophysiological
consciousness metrics able to disentangle between these components have
not been reported

 here we propose an explainable consciousness
indicator eci using deep learning to disentangle the components of
consciousness

 we employ electroencephalographic eeg responses to
transcranial magnetic stimulation under various conditions including
sleep n 6 general anesthesia n 16 and severe brain injury
n 34

 we also test our framework using restingstate eeg under
general anesthesia n 15 and severe brain injury n 34

 eci
simultaneously quantifies arousal and awareness under physiological
pharmacological and pathological conditions

 particularly
ketamineinduced anesthesia and rapid eye movement sleep with low
arousal and high awareness are clearly distinguished from other states


in addition parietal regions appear most relevant for quantifying
arousal and awareness

 this indicator provides insights into the neural
correlates of altered states of consciousness

introduction

responsiveness is often thought to reflect consciousness and for a long
time unresponsiveness was considered as a surrogate of unconsciousness


however consciousness and responsiveness are two different concepts¹


consciousness is considered to be absent during sleep or anesthesia but
in certain instances subjective experience can still occur e

g


dreaming23

 similarly consciousness has been described as a result
of both arousal and awareness components⁴

 arousal refers to the overall
state of alertness or wakefulness

 in contrast awareness refers to
the subjective experience such as perceiving a blue triangle versus a
red circle⁵

 typically at the clinical level arousal is indicated by
the opening of the eyes and awareness is inferred by the ability to
follow commands



various levels of consciousness exist in physiological pharmacological
and pathological modifications of consciousness table 1

 in nonrapid
eye movement nrem sleep with no subsequent reports of subjective
experiences both arousal and awareness are low

 however in rapid eye
movement rem sleep with dreams arousal is low but awareness can reach
high levels56

 under general anesthesia propofol and xenon
predominantly induce states similar to nrem sleep without subjective
experiences whereas ketamine induces dreamlike experiences similar to
rem sleep with subjective reports upon awakening37

 additionally
recent findings suggest that a minority of patients under anesthesia may
also be conscious of their environment during a surgical procedure
which is referred to as connected consciousness

 these patients exhibit
the ability to follow commands using the isolated forearm technique⁸
without recollection upon awakening

 unresponsive wakefulness syndrome
uws describes patients who recover with their eyes open but only
demonstrate reflex behaviors while patients in a minimally conscious
state mcs present reproducible nonreflex movements⁹

 in both uws and
mcs patients arousal is high however unlike uws mcs patients also
show signs of awareness that can be considered as a sign of volitional
behavior1011

 however certain uws patients assessed several times
with the coma recovery scalerevised crsr¹² may present brain
activity similar to mcs patients e

g

 high brain metabolism measured
by positron emission tomography

 this peculiar state has been termed
nonbehavioral mcs or mcs131415

an effective measure of consciousness labeled perturbational complexity
index pci was developed from electroencephalographic eeg responses
to direct and noninvasive cortical perturbation with transcranial
magnetic stimulation tms¹⁶

 pci quantifies the complexity of
deterministic patterns of significant cortical activation evoked by tms


this index was validated in a large benchmark population to derive an
empirical cutoff pci 0

31 that reliably discriminates between
unconsciousness pcimax ≤ pci nrem sleep midazolam propofol and
xenoninduced anesthesia and consciousness pcimax pci rem
sleep wakefulness ketamineinduced anesthesia and conscious
braininjured patients¹⁷

 however pci cannot discriminate rem sleep or
ketamineinduced anesthesia from healthy wakefulness

 in addition
multiple trials are required to compute pci1617

 a few studies have
attempted to develop an objective measure of consciousness from
restingstate eeg brain activity341819

 interestingly the
spectral exponent which quantifies the slope of power spectral density
of restingstate eeg activity is another measure of consciousness that
is highly correlated with pci and allows distinguishing between ketamine
and propofol or xenoninduced anesthesia³

 in addition when low
1–20 hz and highband 20–40 hz spectral exponents are jointly
considered ketamineinduced anesthesia can be distinguished from
wakefulness and the xenon and propofolinduced anesthesia conditions
are partially superimposed in the spectral exponent consequently these
are difficult to distinguish³

 recently a decrease in highfrequency
oscillations and an increase in lowfrequency power in the primary
sensory motor and visual cortices were observed during rem sleep when
compared to healthy wakefulness²⁰

 the quantification of the spectral
slope between 30 and 50 hz was also proposed for discriminating rem
sleep from healthy wakefulness⁴

 however this measure did not
differentiate rem from nrem sleep thus it distinguishes between
different arousal levels but not awareness levels

 therefore an
alternative measure to simultaneously disentangle the two components of
consciousness requiring fewer trials would be a valuable and necessary
tool



the classical neurophysiological approach for calculating pci power
spectral density and spectral exponent relies on many epochs to improve
the reliability of statistical estimates of these indices²¹

 however
these methods are only suitable for investigating the averaged brain
states and they can only clarify general neurophysiological aspects


machine learning ml allows decoding and identifying specific brain
states and discriminating them from unrelated brain signals even in a
single trial in realtime²²

 this can potentially transform statistical
results at the group level into individual predictions⁹

 a deep neural
network which is a popular approach in ml has been employed to
classify or predict brain states using eeg data²³

 particularly a
convolutional neural network cnn is the most extensively used
technique in deep learning and has proven to be effective in the
classification of eeg data²⁴

 however a cnn has the drawback that it
cannot provide information on why it made a particular prediction²⁵


recently layerwise relevance propagation lrp has successfully
demonstrated why classifiers such as cnns have made a specific
decision²⁶

 specifically the relevance score resulting from the lrp
indicates the contribution of each input variable to the classification
or prediction decision

 thus a high score in a particular area of an
input variable implies that the classifier has made the classification
or prediction using this feature

 for example neurophysiological data
suggest that the left motor region is activated during righthand motor
imagery²⁷

 the lrp indicates that the neural network classifies eeg data
as righthand motor imagery because of the activity of the left motor
region²⁸

 therefore the relevance score was higher in the left motor
region than in other regions

 thus it is possible to interpret the
neurophysiological phenomena underlying the decisions of cnns using lrp



in this work we develop a metric called the explainable consciousness
indicator eci to simultaneously quantify the two components of
consciousness—arousal and awareness—using cnn

 the processed timeseries
eeg data were used as an input of the cnn

 unlike pci which relies on
source modeling and permutationbased statistical analysis eci used
eventrelated potentials at the sensor level for spatiotemporal dynamics
and ml approaches

 for a generalized model we used the
leaveoneparticipantout lopo approach for transfer learning which
is a type of ml that transfers information to a new participant not
included in the training phase2427

 the proposed indicator is a 2d
value consisting of indicators of arousal eciaro and awareness
eciawa

 first we used tms–eeg data collected from healthy
participants during nrem sleep with no subjective experience rem sleep
with subjective experience and healthy wakefulness to consider each
component of consciousness i

e

 lowhigh arousal and lowhigh
awareness with the aim to analyze correlations between the proposed eci
and the three states namely nrem rem and wakefulness

 next we
measured eci using tms–eeg data collected under general anesthesia with
ketamine propofol and xenon again with the aim to measure correlation
with these three anesthetics

 before anesthesia tms–eeg data were also
recorded during healthy wakefulness

 upon awakening healthy
participants reported conscious experience during ketamineinduced
anesthesia and no conscious experience during propofol and
xenoninduced anesthesia

 finally tms–eeg data were collected from
patients with disorders of consciousness doc which includes patients
diagnosed as uws and mcs patients

 we hypothesized that our proposed eci
can clearly distinguish between the two components of consciousness
under physiological pharmacological and pathological conditions



to verify the proposed indicator we next compared eciawa with pci
which is a reliable index for consciousness

 then we applied eci to
additional restingstate eeg data acquired in the anesthetized
participants and patients with doc

 we hypothesize that if cnn can learn
characteristics related to consciousness it could calculate eci
accurately even without tms in the proposed framework

 in terms of
clinical applicability it is important to use the classifier from the
previous lopo training of the old data to classify the new data without
additional training

 therefore we computed eci in patients with doc
using a holdout approach²⁹ where training data and evaluation data are
arbitrarily divided instead of crossvalidation

 finally we
investigated why the classifier generated these decisions using lrp to
interpret eci³⁰

 we show that proposed eci using interpretable deep
learning distinguishes arousal and awareness between normal
consciousness sleep anesthesia and patients with doc

 furthermore we
show that the parietal region is most closely related to quantifying
arousal and awareness in altered states of consciousness



results

overview of the calculation of eci

we used tms–eeg data in three conditions i sleep ii general
anesthesia and iii severely braininjured patients fig

 1a


figure 1b shows the framework for calculating eci to distinguish between
low and high states in each arousal and awareness

 to explore the
optimal input and classifier we compared the singletrial
classification performance in each component see supplementary
notes 1–2 supplementary figs

 1–3 and supplementary tables 1–3

 for
an input in the classifier we converted timeseries eeg data to 3d data
2d meshes according to the spatial information 1d vector according to
temporal information

 the cnn model was used to distinguish low from
high state in each arousal and awareness

 next the interclass
probability in the new target participant was calculated using the
trained model

 finally eci was measured by averaging the probability of
a high state in each arousal and awareness over a single session



figure 1

a data description

 the same participants participated in transcranial
magnetic stimulationinduced electroencephalography tms–eeg and
restingstate electroencephalography eeg measurements

 the sleep
condition did not include restingstate eeg and one participant under
ketaminemediated anesthesia was missing in restingstate eeg

 b
schematic framework for determining the explainable consciousness
indicator eci

 in step 1 raw eeg signals were converted into a
spatiospectral or spatiotemporal 3d matrix

 in step 2 the converted 3d
feature was used on a convolutional neural network in the two components
of consciousness arousal and awareness

 in each arousal and awareness
state the eeg data were trained as two classes low versus high

 for
example for awareness rapid eye movement rem sleep with subjective
experience i

e

 dreaming and healthy wakefulness belong to the same
class in terms of high awareness however for arousal nonrapid eye
movement nrem with no subjective experience and rem sleep with
subjective experience belong to the same class in terms of low arousal


the output pi indicates the probability in the trial i of
arousal and awareness

 for the training and test phase we used the
leaveone participantout approach as transfer learning

 therefore the
eeg data in the source pool were used for training and the data of
target participants was predicted for arousal or awareness

 the source
pool contains data corresponding to the source domain except for the
target participant

 in step 3 the interclass probability for each
arousal and awareness was averaged for calculating eci in each session
j

 the averaged probability cj is eciaro and eciawa on
the x and yaxes respectively

 therefore we represented the 2d
consciousness indicator for the two components of consciousness

 in the
final step we checked which brain signals the model has learned and why
it made such a decision using layerwise relevance propagation lrp


through this step we could interpret the proposed indicator


eciawa eci in awareness component eciaro eci in arousal

 1 overview of the study



to improve the classification performance we trained the models with
domain transfer learning which uses the knowledge learned in one domain
to improve generalization based on similarity in the sense of pooling
the training data across domains supplementary fig

 4

 when referring
to domain transfer learning using the eeg signals in this study the
domain refers to the clinical condition in which the eeg signals were
acquired

 precisely three domains were considered here sleep
anesthesia and patients with doc

 in domain transfer learning the
target domain indicates a state that contains a single session for
calculating eci whereas the source domain indicates those sessions that
are included in the training phase

 therefore the information
knowledge trained in the source domain is applied when testing the
target domain and this is described as the transfer of learned
information for domain transfer learning

 in the lopo approach the data
from all the participants in the source domain except for the target
participant were used for training supplementary fig

 3b

 note that
the data for training and testing did not overlap

 we used all three
domains to classify high and low states in both arousal and awareness
table 2

 consequently the classification performance was higher when
training with a closer domain see supplementary notes 3–4 and
supplementary table 4

 therefore we trained these domains together
when calculating eci in sleep and anesthesia domains but trained the
doc domain along with the anesthesia domain when calculating eci in
patients with doc

similarly we classified low and high states in restingstate eeg data
for arousal and awareness using domain transfer learning table 3

 this
result was similar to the classification performance of tms–eeg data
considering that there was no restingstate eeg during sleep in the same
participants see supplementary note 4

 based on the results of domain
transfer learning we used only the anesthesia domain for calculating
eci under anesthesia however the doc and anesthesia domains were used
for calculating eci in patients with doc

 eci in
ketamineinduced anesthesia demonstrated low arousal and high awareness
whereas propofol and xenoninduced anesthesia showed low arousal and

 also all periods of wakefulness showed high arousal and

 as a result of the roc analysis classification using eci
achieved an auc sensitivity and specificity of 1

0 for all parameters
for both arousal and awareness fig

 roc analysis for arousal was not
conducted because both uws and mcs patients were considered to have high
arousal

 we additionally applied eci to four mcs patients these cases
were not included in the training phase

 similar to patients with doc
anesthesia and doc domains were selected as source domains in the
training phase

 for the mcs patients eci successfully predicted high
arousal and awareness as expected supplementary fig

relationship with pci

we calculated pci in tms–eeg sessions that had at least 80 trials with
healthy participants under sleep anesthesia and braininjury
conditions

 pci in all three conditions was consistent with the optimal
cutoff 0

between consciousness and unconsciousness in a benchmark population

eci the optimal cutoff of 0

the practicality of calculating eci

we explored the possibility of calculating eci with a limited number of
trials during sleep and wakefulness

 the classification performance was
compared through the calculation of eci from a single trial up to the
standard number of trials i

e

 80 trials similar to pci¹⁶ fig

in the sleep and healthy wakefulness conditions the performance reached
a specificity of 0

853 a sensitivity of 0

884 and an auc of 0

931 when
using single trials based on one tms pulse but from 2 trials it was
above 0

 in the anesthesia and
patients with doc conditions the detailed performance from 1 to 80
trials is shown in supplementary note 6

 5 performance of eciawa according to the number of trials in
the eci calculation



figure 6 shows the possibility of awareness being high for the first
participant in each of these conditions sleep anesthesia ketamine
propofol and xenon and patients with doc uws and mcs

 for instance
as nrem sleep is considered to have low awareness in p01 it was
correctly predicted when the probability in a single trial was less than
0

5

 notably nrem sleep showed that 17 trials were incorrectly
predicted with a probability higher than 0

5

 in addition 1 out of 80
trials in both rem sleep and healthy wakefulness showed a value less
than 0

5 and were incorrectly predicted

 this indicates that eci can be
predicted as somewhat low or high even in a single trial

 there was a
clear spatiotemporal difference between correct and incorrect trials
only in parietal regions supplementary fig

 6

 no significant
differences between both types of trials were observed over frontal and
temporal regions

 however in parietal regions tmsevoked potentials at
350–400 ms were significantly higher in incorrect trials than in correct
trials

 in a single trial these different patterns resulted in
misprediction

 nevertheless the effect of the incorrect trials i

e

 a
failure to predict was eliminated because eci was calculated by
averaging the interclass probability in a single trial

 the probability
in a single trial is shown in supplementary figs

 7–9 for other
participants in all conditions



figure 6

we depicted the probability of a representative participant p01 in all
conditions sleep anesthesia doc

 p01 was the first participant of
each list randomly chosen

 each colored box indicates the probability
that the corresponding trial is considered as high awareness in each
participant

 if it was a perfect prediction in one trial during sleep
and healthy wakefulness nrem sleep with no subjective experience low
awareness has a probability of less than 0

5 whereas rem sleep and
normal wakefulness high awareness have probabilities of more than 0

5


under anesthesia and wakefulness ketamine and wakefulness before
anesthesia are high awareness whereas propofol and xenon have low
awareness

 mcs and uws patients have high and low awareness
respectively

to demonstrate that the method can be easily applied to a new set of
patients without additional training to identify their state of
consciousness in a clinical setting we computed eci using the holdout
approach

 the dataset in the patients with doc was split between the
training and evaluation sets with respective ratios of 0

75 and 0

25

 in
other words two mcs patients and five uws patients were completely
excluded from training and their eci was calculated

 consequently ecis
using conventional lopo and the holdout approaches showed high positive
correlation eciaro r 0

886
p 0

001 supplementary figure 10

 in both tms–eeg and restingstate
eeg the eci using the holdout method indicated high arousal and
awareness in mcs patients whereas high arousal and low awareness in uws
patients

 this was consistent with 0

5 typical cutoffs

 these results
show that the proposed method generalizes to new data without retraining
the classifier



interpretation for calculating eci

we further checked what the classifier learned through cnn and how it
was able to derive those results using lrp

 this algorithm describes the
predictions of cnn in a given dataset using relevance scores³⁰

 figure 7
shows the relevance scores for arousal and awareness among the frontal
temporal and parietal regions at the scalp level for calculating eci
using tms–eeg

 a high relevance score implies that the trained model
recognized the brain region that determines whether it is low or high
arousal and awareness

 specifically brain regions with higher relevance
scores indicate that brain signals over that region contributed more to
the decision of the classifier on whether arousal and awareness were low
or high

 in the three conditions sleep anesthesia and patients with
doc the relevance score over the parietal region was higher than those
in the frontal and temporal regions at the group level for both arousal
and awareness

 the detailed statistical results are reported in
supplementary table 5

 however since most tms sites targeted the
parietal cortex it can be argued that the relevance of parietal regions
to correctly classify datasets may be biased

 therefore we investigated
the relevance scores with only nonparietal stimulations in patients
with doc

 as a result the parietal region had statistically higher
relevance scores than the frontal and temporal regions in both arousal
and awareness supplementary fig

 11 and table 6

 similarly there was
a higher relevance score over the parietal region in both arousal and
awareness when calculating eci from restingstate eeg supplementary

discussion

we show that eci clearly distinguishes between low and high states of
arousal and awareness in tms–eeg results under sleep anesthesia and
patients with doc

 our results suggest that this proposed indicator
could similarly be used for restingstate eeg data without tms under
anesthesia and patients with doc yielding the same degree of accuracy


in addition a high correlation with pci which measures the integrated
eeg response of the thalamocortical system to a direct perturbation
induced by tms¹⁶ proves that eciawa is reliable using tms–eeg data


it also shows that the two measures calculated entirely independently
using different methods resulted in the same conclusion which is a sign
that deep learning is indeed a valid and reliable approach

 for an
mlbased indicator eci can be calculated using very few trials


furthermore because the classifier learned specific features of the
data on its own our indicator can be computed regardless of whether tms
is applied or its location

 therefore eci is a significantly practical
and reliable indicator to evaluate levels of consciousness under various
conditions

 our analyses using lrp highlighted the major role of the
parietal region in determining consciousness as the classifier
primarily uses brain activity in this lobe for predicting low and high
states of arousal and awareness



tms–eeg responses under sleep exhibited wellknown phenomena³¹

 in
wakefulness tms generates a series of lowamplitude highfrequency
activities related to cortical flow in longrange connections³²

 a
similar longlasting response is evoked during rem sleep with subjective
experience³³

 during nrem sleep with no subjective experience tms
triggers larger lowfrequency activity that quickly dissipates³² which
is the hallmark of bistability in the thalamocortical system

 cortical
effective connectivity is also broken down during nrem sleep3334


the brain response to tms perturbation was already used to distinguish
the levels of awareness irrespective of sensory processing and motor
responses under physiological pharmacological and pathological
conditions343536

 therefore this tmsevoked response was applied
to our endtoend cnn framework

 similar to several studies using ml we
observed higher twoclass low or high classification accuracy using
cnn when compared to linear discriminant analysis lda and support
vector machine svm for both arousal and awareness

 this suggests that
our framework is especially relevant for eeg results which possess
several nonlinear features

 the classification performance of
spatiotemporal information was higher than that of spatiospectral
information

 using our framework it was shown that temporal information
discriminates different levels of consciousness more clearly than
spectral information as the functional connectivity associated with
consciousness changes in both space and time³⁷

 however this does not
imply that temporal information is more important than spectral
information for distinguishing consciousness

 temporal information has
more distinct characteristics than spectral information for predicting
the state of consciousness in the proposed framework

 nevertheless pci
also used spatiotemporal dynamics in tmsevoked responses¹⁶ which is
significantly important for distinguishing consciousness



we applied transfer learning to a single domain as well as multiple
domains

 in the sleep domain classification performance was high when
trained on only the sleep domain or together with the anesthesia domain


due to a large number of trials in the sleep domain training was
performed satisfactorily using only sleep data

 the distance of the
averaged tmsevoked potentials under the domains of anesthesia and sleep
was significantly close which indicated that the two domains were
highly similar³⁸

 thus a close distance implies that the two domains
have similar patterns and the classification performance indeed
increased when these domains were trained together

 in the anesthesia
and doc domains the trials of a single domain were not sufficient thus
a higher classification performance was achieved when trained with
similar domains

 in addition brain signals change over time even when
recorded with the same participants because of physiological and
psychological differences over time²⁷

 therefore
participantindependent learning such as the lopo crossvalidation is
considerably difficult as opposed to participantdependent learning²⁴


we solved these problems via transfer learning utilizing multiple
domains and participantindependent eci



eci by averaging interclass probability distinguished whether each
state was low or high in both arousal and awareness

 because of its
inherently high twoclass performance it was possible to calculate the
discriminable eci using a few trials in a single session

 the criteria
used for determining eciaro and eciawa were different especially
for rem sleep ketamineinduced anesthesia and uws patients

 although
the dataset was the same these states were trained by different labels
depending on arousal and awareness

 for instance rem sleep is high in
awareness but low in arousal

 the proposed classifier learns models for
these different criteria by training itself based on the criteria of
arousal and awareness

 specifically because the learning ability of the
cnn is derived from the automatic extraction of complicated
representations from eeg signals³⁹ it can properly distinguish between
both states even if the same state has different labels depending on
the criteria

 we further used data from mcs patients as verification
samples

 mcs patients were correctly predicted since data from uws and
mcs patients were included during training and the classifier is
independent of behavior



according to the lrp we observed higher relevance scores in the
parietal regions compared to other regions at the scalp level

 this was
observed for all data including tms–eeg and restingstate eeg results


the brain regions that led to decisionmaking were similar in arousal
and awareness

 however this does not imply that arousal and awareness
are supported by the same underlying neurophysiological mechanisms

 the
relevance scores simply explain the patterns of cortical eeg activity
resulting in this classification



in sleep and healthy wakefulness when arousal and awareness were high
they were highly relevant in the parietal region

 this eeg feature
which distinguishes high and low states in arousal and awareness can be
interpreted in line with the posterior hot zone of consciousness⁴⁰


local changes in this parietal region are associated with the occurrence
of dreaming and unconscious sleep4142 and our framework may learn
from eeg pivotal features recorded in this area

 the importance of the
posterior hot zone has already been emphasized using the withinstate
sleep paradigm4344

 similar to sleep we observed high relevance
scores for the parietal region in the domains of both anesthesia and
patients with doc

 this implies that eeg activity in this region had a
decisive effect in determining the high and low states of arousal and
awareness

 the increased slowwave activity was observed under propofol
and xenoninduced anesthesia when compared to healthy wakefulness before
drug administration³⁶

 in addition just as cortical neurons induced
bistable changes during nrem sleep tms in propofolmediated
anesthesiainduced lowamplitude lowfrequency positive–negative
potentials and tms in xenonmediated anesthesia caused a significantly
large amplitude but stereotyped positive–negative deflection³⁶


moreover under ketamineinduced anesthesia tmsevoked response was
determined to be similar to rem sleep which features dreaming during a
low state of arousal³⁶

 previous studies have shown that the change in
slow waves induced by propofol is primarily observed in the posterior
hot zone⁴⁵ and the posterior main hub is disrupted during
anesthesiainduced alteration of consciousness⁷

 in uws patients tms
triggered a local and slow response similar to nrem sleep and general
anesthesia whereas mcs patients showed complex tmsevoked responses³³


similarly differences in alpha connectivity between the uws and mcs
patients are apparent within the posterior hot zone⁴⁶

 that is when
determining whether arousal and awareness are low or high our
classifiers used differences and changes in eeg activity over the
parietal region to make decisions

 particularly similar results were
observed in patients with doc using several tms target sites and in
sleep and anesthesia domains where the parietal region was primarily
stimulated

 this suggests that our findings regarding the parietal
region are unrelated to the tms target site

 thus our trained model
used neurophysiological features to classify whether arousal and
awareness are low or high

 this indicates an appropriate design of our
model as the classification decision was primarily based on eeg signals
over the parietal region which is suggested to be a hot spot of
consciousness compared to the frontal region⁴³

 the difference in the
parietal region could be clearly identified through correct trials
during sleep and healthy wakefulness

 it is meaningful that the frontal
region contributed less than parietal regions in the context of the
controversy regarding the spatial localization of the neural correlates
of consciousness4045

 considering the subcortical influences related
to striatalthalamic circuits it has been recently observed that the
parietal region contributes more to the levels of consciousness than the
frontal region⁴⁷

 the implication of the parietal cortex in
consciousness has also been demonstrated in other neuroimaging
modalities such as functional magnetic resonance imaging⁴⁸ and
magnetoencephalography⁴⁹



this study does have certain limitations

 first our sample size was
relatively small

 in the future it will be necessary to further test
the reliability of the proposed indicator with larger cohorts and
validate it at the clinical level before implementing it in a clinical
setting

 sleep experiments would also have to be applied to more
participants in the future

 second we explored the possibility of
calculating eci with a minimal amount of data up to a single trial


however we did not attempt to measure eci in real time

 thus in the
future eci could be calculated in realtime for practical application


third eci does not differentiate between physiological
pharmacological and pathological conditions but distinguishes between
high and low states of arousal and awareness

 eci can thus distinguish
between rem sleep or ketamine and wakefulness

 it may also be
difficult to select the model to use when calculating eci since the
domain has to be known beforehand

 nevertheless if a single domain has
sufficient trials the lopo approach would be the most accurate

 another
limitation might be related to the possible contamination of tmseeg
data by auditory and somatosensory components

 as in previous
studies173536 to avoid auditory and somatosensory costimulation
participants wore earphones with noise masking and a thin foam between
the scalp and the tms coil that was used

 although it is difficult to
systematically rule out the contribution of sensory costimulation in
every measurement the application of effective noisemasking
procedures⁵⁰ and the realtime monitoring of data quality during the
acquisition⁵¹ may significantly mitigate this issue⁵²

 finally eci
indicates whether arousal and awareness are low or high and cannot be
considered functional

 it therefore should be developed into a
functional index



in conclusion we proposed eci as a neurophysiological indicator to
simultaneously discriminate the levels of arousal and awareness in
modified states of consciousness

 this tool allows disentangling the
levels of consciousness with a single measure in different clinical
settings such as monitoring surgical interventions i

e


anesthesiainduced states and diagnosing patients with doc

 this
indicator was validated under different physiological pharmacological
and pathological conditions and it reliably disentangled low levels
from high levels of both arousal and awareness

 besides the proposed
eci is considerably accessible and practical as it can be applied to
restingstate eeg without tms and requires fewer trials

 therefore the
proposed indicator can be a reliable discriminator and valuable tool as
an objective measure of consciousness

 as parietal regions appear to be
the most relevant for classification an eeg configuration around that
area could be sufficient if eci is used in clinical practice

 these
findings could be useful in diagnosing severely braininjured patients
and monitoring their levels of consciousness in realtime especially in
clinical settings where time constraints preclude longduration
assessment

 the proposed reliable eci can provide insights into the
classification of conscious levels using deep learning and neural
correlates of consciousness

 this study was approved by the ethics committee of

legal representatives of patients provided written informed consent
before the experiments moreover newly recorded data used exactly the
same procedure as before

 these added data were recently acquired by dr


olivia gosseries pr

 steven laureys team at the university of liège


for the added data the inclusion and exclusion criteria for patients
were exactly the same as the previously used data

 these data are part
of a bigger study conducted in the frame of the human brain project

 the
final dataset consisted of 15 uws patients 15 mcs patients and 4 mcs
patients

 the detailed demographic and clinical information of severely
braininjured patients is listed in supplementary table 10

 the tms
target site was selected using a neuronavigation system over the
parietal motor or premotor regions avoiding structural lesions using
the magnetic resonance imaging data of the patient

 the stimuli target
sites for all participants are listed in supplementary table 11

 the
participants remained awake or were kept awake using the crsr arousal
protocol in between tms stimulation¹²



for the four datasets eeg data were recorded using a 60channel
tmscompatible amplifier and a twochannel electrooculogram nexstim
eximia nexstim plc finland with a 1450 hz sampling rate

 during all
the sessions earphones presenting white noise were used to reduce the
noise of the tms pulses and we used a thin foam between the scalp and
the tms coil to avoid somatosensory evoked potentials

 these pulses were
presented at random intervals of 2–2

3 s using a figureofeight coil


the maximum electric field was between 100 and 130 vm at the tms target
site

 in particular the tms stimulation was always performed in the
medial half of one hemisphere to avoid any muscle artifacts



finally we used restingstate eeg without tms for the domains of
anesthesia and severely braininjured patients

 these data were acquired
using the same participants as in the tms–eeg experiments

 we used the
ketamine n 5 propofol n 5 and xenoninduced anesthesia data
n 5 as previously reported by sarasso et al

³⁶

 for at least 3 min
before the tms–eeg experiments restingstate eeg data were recorded
during anesthesia and each state of wakefulness before the anesthesia


with regard to the severely braininjured patients 5min restingstate
eeg for mcs patients n 15 and uws patients n 15 was included

 in
addition four mcs patients were added along with the same participants
for whom tms–eeg was recorded

 the sampling rate was 1450 hz

 finally
among previously published data the data with a signaltonoise of 1

4
or less were excluded from the analysis¹⁶



data preprocessing

tms–eeg data were preprocessed using the sisyphus project matlab program
university of milan italy and the eeglab toolbox⁵⁷

 the signals were
downsampled to 362

5 hz and bandpass filtered between 0

5 and 45 hz
using a secondorder butterworth filter

 the signals of −400 to 1000 ms
were segmented and baselinecorrected using the 400 ms baseline before
the tms pulses

 bad channels were manually detected and interpolated
using superfast spherical interpolation for artifact removal

 we also
discarded the components related to eye movements using independent
component analysis and removed trials setting a threshold of ±100 μv
affected by ocular artifacts other artifacts or noise

 the data were
rereferenced to an average reference5859



restingstate eeg data were processed using the eeglab toolbox⁵⁷


preprocessing was performed using a process similar to that used with
tms–eeg data with segmentation being performed every 1 s

 the number of
trials for each session we used is listed for patients under anesthesia
supplementary table 12 and severely braininjured patients
supplementary table 13



proposed framework for calculating an eci

step 1—extraction of eeg features in all trials of all tms–eeg data we
used the 200–400 ms time window of data after the tms regardless of the
lateralization or target site of the tms in sleep anesthesia and for
patients with severe brain injury

 more details related to this
deliberate choice are reported in supplementary note 2

 in restingstate
eeg only the first 200 ms of data were used from the segmented 1 s of
data

 in the first step eeg data were converted from 2d raw signals to
3d input

 to preserve the spatial information and characteristics of
eeg we used spatiospectral and spatiotemporal 3d features

 the raw eeg
signals at time index t are measured in a 1d data vector
rtleftst1st2sticdots
stnrightt where sti is the acquisition
data by the ith electrode channel at timestamp t

 n indicates the
number of electrode channels

 however these simple signals do not
capture all the spatial information characteristics in the brain


therefore we converted 1d data vectors to 2d eeg data meshes using the
spatial information of the electrode location

 zero was inserted in the
place of a null electrode in 2d matrices at time index t⁶⁰

 finally we
calculated 3d data by adding spectral or temporal information
supplementary fig

 14

 specifically spectral information was divided
into 5 frequency bands delta 1

5–4 hz theta 4–8 hz alpha
8–13 hz beta 13–30 hz and gamma bands 30–40 hz⁴⁴

 finally a
10 × 11 × 5 matrix using spectral information and a 10 × 11 × 72 matrix
using temporal information were used as the final cnn inputs here
10 × 11 the converted matrix of spatial information 5 delta theta
alpha beta and gamma bands of spectral information 72 200–400 ms of
temporal information



step 2—calculation of interclass probability using cnn the model was
trained to distinguish both arousal and awareness in terms of whether
they were low or high

 we first calculated the domain similarity based
on the cosine distance for domain transfer learning

 the cosine distance
d between domains a and b is defined as follows

dleftabright1fracfarm tfbparallel
faparallel parallel fbparallel

1

where parallel bullet parallel indicates the norm of a vector


this similarity was used when selecting the source domain for domain
transfer learning³⁸

 in calculating the similarity according to the
states of arousal and awareness the labels in each state are different


during sleep nrem sleep with no subjective experience and rem sleep
with subjective experience were learned as low arousal whereas healthy
wakefulness was learned as high arousal

 conversely in awareness rem
sleep with subjective experience and healthy wakefulness indicated by
open eyes were learned as high awareness while nrem sleep with no
subjective experience was learned as low awareness

 specifically we
used stage 3 of nrem sleep for clear feature extraction of deep sleep


under general anesthesia and in healthy wakefulness before anesthesia
the arousal state was divided as follows i low when under ketamine
propofol and xenoninduced anesthesia and ii high when in healthy
wakefulness before anesthesia

 conversely the awareness state was
divided into low under propofol and xenoninduced anesthesia and high
under ketamineinduced anesthesia and healthy wakefulness before
anesthesia

 finally in patients with doc uws and mcs patients were
distinguished in terms of awareness low uws patients and high mcs
patients

 the uws and mcs patients corresponded to high arousal



deep learning was conducted in a matlab environment powered by a titan v
gpu

 we used the lrp toolbox³⁰ for cnn classification and
interpretation

 the cnn was applied to the two components of
consciousness arousal and awareness

 in each architecture we inserted
five convolutional layers with 2d filters for the deep neural network


the first layer with 100 filters and the second layer with 80 filters
featured kernel sizes of 3 × 3 and 2 × 2 with stride 1 × 1
respectively

 then a maxpooling layer with a pool size of 2 × 2 and
stride 1 × 2 was added

 similarly two convolutional layers with kernel
sizes of 3 × 3 with stride 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 with stride 2 × 1 were
subsequently used

 after maxpooling with a pool size of 2 × 1 and
stride 2 × 1 a final convolutional layer comprising two filters with a
kernel size of 1 × 1 and stride 1 × 1 was incorporated

 finally the
generated feature maps were flattened into a 1d vector

 a softmax layer
was used for classification

 in the softmax layer each element
indicates the probability that the original input belongs to the
corresponding class

 in this training procedure the parameters in the
deep neural network were learned through backpropagation

 the
activation function in each convolutional layer was a rectified linear
unit

 the detailed cnn architecture is presented in supplementary
table 14

 the adam optimizer was used with an initial learning rate of
0

005 and the learning rate was updated to sublinear for learning rate
decay during an evaluation step of training

 specifically we used
hyperparameters as values of 0

9 for β1 0

999 for β2 for adam
optimizer⁶¹

 the batch size was 25 for training and the maximum number
of training iterations was five times the number of training data


consequently the output of this architecture was the probability of
each class



for a comparison with other classifiers we also considered an lda
classifier⁶² and svm with polynomial kernel function⁶³ using the same
input data as fair baseline methods

 the classification performance was
measured in loponested crossvalidation for the generalized neural
network

 this method is a special case of kfold crossvalidation


specifically all participants except one the target participant were
used for training and the target participant was then tested using the
classifier

 in the training phase 80 of the datasets were used to
learn the classifier and the remaining 20 were reserved for
validation

 this process was repeated for each participant

 further
internal validation sets inner crossvalidation were performed to
choose the hyperparameters of the model⁶⁴

 thus the same
hyperparameters were selected in the external validation sets⁶⁵

 the
lopo crossvalidation procedure uses data efficiently and can reduce
overfitting

 it also provides unbiased estimates of the averaged
classification error for all possible training sets⁶⁶

 the same
loponested crossvalidation is applied in lda and svm using the berlin
brain–computer interface toolbox⁶⁷

 three possible values 0

0001 0

01
and 1 were chosen as penalties for misclassification in the svm
model⁶⁵

 for spatiospectral input and spatiotemporal input 1 and 0

0001
were used respectively



step 3—calculation of eci in a single session we obtained each
interclass probability according to two components arousal and
awareness at the previous step

 in each tms session the interclass
probability was averaged to calculate an eci

 this approach has the
advantage of being able to offset outliers



cjfrac1nmathopsum limitsi1npi

2

here pi is the probability of high arousal or high awareness
from each trial i among the probability values high versus low for
the two classes from the softmax function in the cnn

 n is the number of
trials in a single session j

 the averaged interclass probability
cj from arousal is the value of the xaxis as eciaro and
the averaged interclass probability cj from awareness becomes
the value of the yaxis as eciawa

 consequently eci is expressed as
a 2d indicator representing both arousal and awareness simultaneously


as mentioned earlier we used the lopo crossvalidation

 it is to be
noted that only data from one participant were used as the test and the
data from the remaining participants were used for training

 finally
the test and training data did not demonstrate an overlap at all



step 4—interpretation using lrp we used lrp based on a
backwardpropagation mechanism for interpretability of the deep neural
networks

 this calculated the pixelbased decomposition process²⁸



mathopsum limitsp1drpfrmx

3

here x x1ldots xd indicates an input vector and
frmx is the model output

 the relevance score
rp is the decomposition of the prediction for the input
xp

 this score is calculated through the backward propagation
of the model input

 therefore relevance scores describe a single
nonlinear decision for the output corresponding to each input⁶⁸

 through
this method we can observe not only the interpretation of
classification decisions but also what features the model has learned²⁸


to investigate which brain regions and signals caused these
classification results we compared the relevance scores from the lrp by
dividing them into the following three regions⁶⁹ the frontal fp1–2
fpz af1–2 afz f1–8 and fz temporal ft9–10 t7–8 tp9–10 and
parietal cp1–6 cpz p1–4 p7–8 and pz regions

 we focused on the
frontal temporal and parietal regions when comparing the relevance
score resulting from the lrp as there is an ongoing debate regarding
which brain area i

e

 the front versus the back is related to
consciousness⁴⁰

 we also included the temporal region as activation in
the nrem sleep increases in this region⁷⁰



additional eeg analyses are shown in supplementary methods as follows
i performance according to the number of trials in the eci
calculation ii comparison of the difference between correct and
incorrect trials and iii classification performance using eeg signals
excluding frontal or parietal electrodes



comparison with pci

we compared eciawa with the pci values computed following the same
procedure described in¹⁶

 pci measures the complexity of the
spatiotemporal patterns of cortical activity significantly evoked by
tms¹⁶

 pci ranges between 0 minimum complexity and 1 maximum
complexity

 previous extensive validation of pci provided an empirical
cutoff pci 0

31 to discriminate between consciousness and
unconsciousness¹⁷



statistical analysis

we used the kruskal–wallis test nonparametric oneway analysis of
variance to analyze the differences in the classification accuracy
moreover twosided multiple ttests were used for posthoc analysis
using fisher s least significant differences method for multiple
comparisons to compare the classification performance of the three
classifiers lda svm and cnn of sleep data for each component
arousal and awareness and at threetime ranges 0–200 200–400
400–600 ms of spatiotemporal information

 the kruskal–wallis test was
also performed to compare the classification performance using transfer
learning

 similarly fisher s least significant differences method was
applied after the twosided multiple ttests



to investigate the discrimination of eci in each state of consciousness
the feedforward network was trained with 20 hidden layers using the lopo
approach

 for each output class the auc sensitivity and specificity
were calculated using roc analysis



the kruskal–wallis test was employed to investigate if there were any
differences in relevance scores among brain regions from lrp under
sleep

 we performed twosided multiple ttests using fisher s least
significant differences method for multiple comparisons

 in addition
the kruskal–wallis test was performed to explore the differences in
relevance scores from lrp under the condition of anesthesia and for
severely braininjured patients

 for posthoc analysis twosided
multiple ttests were performed using fisher s least significant
differences method for multiple comparisons



finally we used pearson s correlation to investigate the relationship
between eciawa and pci

 in this study all significances were
indicated by rmalpha 0
