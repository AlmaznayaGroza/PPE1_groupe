Abstract

Consciousness
can
be
defined
by
two
components
:
arousal
(wakefulness)
and
awareness
(subjective
experience)
.


However
,
neurophysiological
consciousness
metrics
able
to
disentangle
between
these
components
have
not
been
reported
.


Here
,
we
propose
an
explainable
consciousness
indicator
(ECI)
using
deep
learning
to
disentangle
the
components
of
consciousness
.


We
employ
electroencephalographic
(EEG)
responses
to
transcranial
magnetic
stimulation
under
various
conditions
,
including
sleep
(n
=
6)
,
general
anesthesia
(n
=
16)
,
and
severe
brain
injury
(n
=
34)
.


We
also
test
our
framework
using
resting-state
EEG
under
general
anesthesia
(n
=
15)
and
severe
brain
injury
(n
=
34)
.


ECI
simultaneously
quantifies
arousal
and
awareness
under
physiological
,
pharmacological
,
and
pathological
conditions
.


Particularly
,
ketamine-induced
anesthesia
and
rapid
eye
movement
sleep
with
low
arousal
and
high
awareness
are
clearly
distinguished
from
other
states
.


In
addition
,
parietal
regions
appear
most
relevant
for
quantifying
arousal
and
awareness
.


This
indicator
provides
insights
into
the
neural
correlates
of
altered
states
of
consciousness
.

Introduction

Responsiveness
is
often
thought
to
reflect
consciousness
,
and
for
a
long
time
,
unresponsiveness
was
considered
as
a
surrogate
of
unconsciousness
.


However
,
consciousness
and
responsiveness
are
two
different
concepts¹
.


Consciousness
is
considered
to
be
absent
during
sleep
or
anesthesia
,
but
in
certain
instances
,
subjective
experience
can
still
occur
(e
.

g
.


,
dreaming)^(2
,3)
.


Similarly
,
consciousness
has
been
described
as
a
result
of
both
arousal
and
awareness
components⁴
.


Arousal
refers
to
the
overall
state
of
alertness
(or
wakefulness)
.


In
contrast
,
awareness
refers
to
the
subjective
experience
,
such
as
perceiving
a
blue
triangle
versus
a
red
circle⁵
.


Typically
,
at
the
clinical
level
,
arousal
is
indicated
by
the
opening
of
the
eyes
,
and
awareness
is
inferred
by
the
ability
to
follow
commands
.



Various
levels
of
consciousness
exist
in
physiological
,
pharmacological
,
and
pathological
modifications
of
consciousness
(Table 1)
.


In
non-rapid
eye
movement
(NREM)
sleep
with
no
subsequent
reports
of
subjective
experiences
,
both
arousal
and
awareness
are
low
.


However
,
in
rapid
eye
movement
(REM)
sleep
with
dreams
,
arousal
is
low
but
awareness
can
reach
high
levels^(5
,6)
.


Under
general
anesthesia
,
propofol
and
xenon
predominantly
induce
states
similar
to
NREM
sleep
without
subjective
experiences
,
whereas
ketamine
induces
dream-like
experiences
similar
to
REM
sleep
with
subjective
reports
upon
awakening^(3
,7)
.


Additionally
,
recent
findings
suggest
that
a
minority
of
patients
under
anesthesia
may
also
be
conscious
of
their
environment
during
a
surgical
procedure
,
which
is
referred
to
as
connected
consciousness
.


These
patients
exhibit
the
ability
to
follow
commands
using
the
isolated
forearm
technique⁸
,
without
recollection
upon
awakening
.


Unresponsive
wakefulness
syndrome
(UWS)
describes
patients
who
recover
with
their
eyes
open
,
but
only
demonstrate
reflex
behaviors
,
while
patients
in
a
minimally
conscious
state
(MCS)
present
reproducible
non-reflex
movements⁹
.


In
both
UWS
and
MCS
patients
,
arousal
is
high
;
however
,
unlike
UWS
,
MCS
patients
also
show
signs
of
awareness
that
can
be
considered
as
a
sign
of
volitional
behavior^(10
,11)
.


However
,
certain
UWS
patients
(assessed
several
times
with
the
Coma
Recovery
Scale-Revised
(CRS-R)¹²
may
present
brain
activity
similar
to
MCS
patients
(e
.

g
.


,
high
brain
metabolism
measured
by
positron
emission
tomography)
.


This
peculiar
state
has
been
termed
non-behavioral
MCS
or
MCS*^(13
,14
,15)
.

An
effective
measure
of
consciousness
,
labeled
perturbational
complexity
index
(PCI)
,
was
developed
from
electroencephalographic
(EEG)
responses
to
direct
and
noninvasive
cortical
perturbation
with
transcranial
magnetic
stimulation
(TMS)¹⁶
.


PCI
quantifies
the
complexity
of
deterministic
patterns
of
significant
cortical
activation
evoked
by
TMS
.


This
index
was
validated
in
a
large
benchmark
population
to
derive
an
empirical
cutoff
(PCI*
=
0
.

31)
that
reliably
discriminates
between
unconsciousness
(PCI_(max)
≤
PCI*
:
NREM
sleep
;
midazolam-
,
propofol-
and
xenon-induced
anesthesia)
and
consciousness
(PCI_(max)
>
PCI*
:
REM
sleep
;
wakefulness
;
ketamine-induced
anesthesia
;
and
conscious
brain-injured
patients)¹⁷
.


However
,
PCI
cannot
discriminate
REM
sleep
or
ketamine-induced
anesthesia
from
healthy
wakefulness
.


In
addition
,
multiple
trials
are
required
to
compute
PCI^(16
,17)
.


A
few
studies
have
attempted
to
develop
an
objective
measure
of
consciousness
from
resting-state
EEG
brain
activity^(3
,4
,18
,19)
.


Interestingly
,
the
spectral
exponent
,
which
quantifies
the
slope
of
power
spectral
density
of
resting-state
EEG
activity
,
is
another
measure
of
consciousness
that
is
highly
correlated
with
PCI
and
allows
distinguishing
between
ketamine
and
propofol
or
xenon-induced
anesthesia³
.


In
addition
,
when
low-
(1–20
Hz)
and
high-band
(20–40
Hz)
spectral
exponents
are
jointly
considered
,
ketamine-induced
anesthesia
can
be
distinguished
from
wakefulness
,
and
the
xenon
and
propofol-induced
anesthesia
conditions
are
partially
superimposed
in
the
spectral
exponent
;
consequently
,
these
are
difficult
to
distinguish³
.


Recently
,
a
decrease
in
high-frequency
oscillations
and
an
increase
in
low-frequency
power
in
the
primary
sensory
,
motor
,
and
visual
cortices
were
observed
during
REM
sleep
when
compared
to
healthy
wakefulness²⁰
.


The
quantification
of
the
spectral
slope
between
30
and
50
Hz
was
also
proposed
for
discriminating
REM
sleep
from
healthy
wakefulness⁴
.


However
,
this
measure
did
not
differentiate
REM
from
NREM
sleep
;
thus
,
it
distinguishes
between
different
arousal
levels
but
not
awareness
levels
.


Therefore
,
an
alternative
measure
to
simultaneously
disentangle
the
two
components
of
consciousness
,
requiring
fewer
trials
,
would
be
a
valuable
and
necessary
tool
.



The
classical
neurophysiological
approach
for
calculating
PCI
,
power
spectral
density
,
and
spectral
exponent
relies
on
many
epochs
to
improve
the
reliability
of
statistical
estimates
of
these
indices²¹
.


However
,
these
methods
are
only
suitable
for
investigating
the
averaged
brain
states
and
they
can
only
clarify
general
neurophysiological
aspects
.


Machine
learning
(ML)
allows
decoding
and
identifying
specific
brain
states
and
discriminating
them
from
unrelated
brain
signals
,
even
in
a
single
trial
in
real-time²²
.


This
can
potentially
transform
statistical
results
at
the
group
level
into
individual
predictions⁹
.


A
deep
neural
network
,
which
is
a
popular
approach
in
ML
,
has
been
employed
to
classify
or
predict
brain
states
using
EEG
data²³
.


Particularly
,
a
convolutional
neural
network
(CNN)
is
the
most
extensively
used
technique
in
deep
learning
and
has
proven
to
be
effective
in
the
classification
of
EEG
data²⁴
.


However
,
a
CNN
has
the
drawback
that
it
cannot
provide
information
on
why
it
made
a
particular
prediction²⁵
.


Recently
,
layer-wise
relevance
propagation
(LRP)
has
successfully
demonstrated
why
classifiers
such
as
CNNs
have
made
a
specific
decision²⁶
.


Specifically
,
the
relevance
score
resulting
from
the
LRP
indicates
the
contribution
of
each
input
variable
to
the
classification
or
prediction
decision
.


Thus
,
a
high
score
in
a
particular
area
of
an
input
variable
implies
that
the
classifier
has
made
the
classification
or
prediction
using
this
feature
.


For
example
,
neurophysiological
data
suggest
that
the
left
motor
region
is
activated
during
right-hand
motor
imagery²⁷
.


The
LRP
indicates
that
the
neural
network
classifies
EEG
data
as
right-hand
motor
imagery
because
of
the
activity
of
the
left
motor
region²⁸
.


Therefore
,
the
relevance
score
was
higher
in
the
left
motor
region
than
in
other
regions
.


Thus
,
it
is
possible
to
interpret
the
neurophysiological
phenomena
underlying
the
decisions
of
CNNs
using
LRP
.



In
this
work
,
we
develop
a
metric
,
called
the
explainable
consciousness
indicator
(ECI)
,
to
simultaneously
quantify
the
two
components
of
consciousness—arousal
and
awareness—using
CNN
.


The
processed
time-series
EEG
data
were
used
as
an
input
of
the
CNN
.


Unlike
PCI
,
which
relies
on
source
modeling
and
permutation-based
statistical
analysis
,
ECI
used
event-related
potentials
at
the
sensor
level
for
spatiotemporal
dynamics
and
ML
approaches
.


For
a
generalized
model
,
we
used
the
leave-one-participant-out
(LOPO)
approach
for
transfer
learning
,
which
is
a
type
of
ML
that
transfers
information
to
a
new
participant
not
included
in
the
training
phase^(24
,27)
.


The
proposed
indicator
is
a
2D
value
consisting
of
indicators
of
arousal
(ECI^(aro))
and
awareness
(ECI^(awa))
.


First
,
we
used
TMS–EEG
data
collected
from
healthy
participants
during
NREM
sleep
with
no
subjective
experience
,
REM
sleep
with
subjective
experience
,
and
healthy
wakefulness
to
consider
each
component
of
consciousness
(i
.

e
.


,
low/high
arousal
and
low/high
awareness)
with
the
aim
to
analyze
correlations
between
the
proposed
ECI
and
the
three
states
,
namely
NREM
,
REM
,
and
wakefulness
.


Next
,
we
measured
ECI
using
TMS–EEG
data
collected
under
general
anesthesia
with
ketamine
,
propofol
,
and
xenon
,
again
with
the
aim
to
measure
correlation
with
these
three
anesthetics
.


Before
anesthesia
,
TMS–EEG
data
were
also
recorded
during
healthy
wakefulness
.


Upon
awakening
,
healthy
participants
reported
conscious
experience
during
ketamine-induced
anesthesia
and
no
conscious
experience
during
propofol-
and
xenon-induced
anesthesia
.


Finally
,
TMS–EEG
data
were
collected
from
patients
with
disorders
of
consciousness
(DoC)
,
which
includes
patients
diagnosed
as
UWS
and
MCS
patients
.


We
hypothesized
that
our
proposed
ECI
can
clearly
distinguish
between
the
two
components
of
consciousness
under
physiological
,
pharmacological
,
and
pathological
conditions
.



To
verify
the
proposed
indicator
,
we
next
compared
ECI^(awa)
with
PCI
,
which
is
a
reliable
index
for
consciousness
.


Then
,
we
applied
ECI
to
additional
resting-state
EEG
data
acquired
in
the
anesthetized
participants
and
patients
with
DoC
.


We
hypothesize
that
if
CNN
can
learn
characteristics
related
to
consciousness
,
it
could
calculate
ECI
accurately
even
without
TMS
in
the
proposed
framework
.


In
terms
of
clinical
applicability
,
it
is
important
to
use
the
classifier
from
the
previous
LOPO
training
of
the
old
data
to
classify
the
new
data
(without
additional
training)
.


Therefore
,
we
computed
ECI
in
patients
with
DoC
using
a
hold-out
approach²⁹
,
where
training
data
and
evaluation
data
are
arbitrarily
divided
,
instead
of
cross-validation
.


Finally
,
we
investigated
why
the
classifier
generated
these
decisions
using
LRP
to
interpret
ECI³⁰
.


We
show
that
proposed
ECI
using
interpretable
deep
learning
distinguishes
arousal
and
awareness
between
normal
consciousness
,
sleep
,
anesthesia
,
and
patients
with
DoC
.


Furthermore
,
we
show
that
the
parietal
region
is
most
closely
related
to
quantifying
arousal
and
awareness
in
altered
states
of
consciousness
.

Overview
of
the
calculation
of
ECI

We
used
TMS–EEG
data
in
three
conditions
:
(i)
sleep
,
(ii)
general
anesthesia
,
and
(iii)
severely
brain-injured
patients
(Fig
.

 1a)
.


Figure 1b
shows
the
framework
for
calculating
ECI
to
distinguish
between
low
and
high
states
in
each
arousal
and
awareness
.


To
explore
the
optimal
input
and
classifier
,
we
compared
the
single-trial
classification
performance
in
each
component
(see
Supplementary
Notes 1–2
,
Supplementary
Figs
.

 1–3
,
and
Supplementary
Tables 1–3)
.


For
an
input
in
the
classifier
,
we
converted
time-series
EEG
data
to
3D
data
(2D
meshes
according
to
the
spatial
information
+
1D
vector
according
to
temporal
information)
.


The
CNN
model
was
used
to
distinguish
low
from
high
state
in
each
arousal
and
awareness
.


Next
,
the
interclass
probability
in
the
new
target
participant
was
calculated
using
the
trained
model
.


Finally
,
ECI
was
measured
by
averaging
the
probability
of
a
high
state
in
each
arousal
and
awareness
over
a
single
session
.

spatiotemporal
3D
matrix
.


In
step
2
,
the
converted
3D
feature
was
used
on
a
convolutional
neural
network
in
the
two
components
of
consciousness
:
arousal
and
awareness
.


In
each
arousal
and
awareness
state
,
the
EEG
data
were
trained
as
two
classes
(low
versus
high)
.


For
example
,
for
awareness
,
rapid
eye
movement
(REM)
sleep
with
subjective
experience
(i
.

e
.


,
dreaming)
and
healthy
wakefulness
belong
to
the
same
class
in
terms
of
high
awareness
;
however
,
for
arousal
,
non-rapid
eye
movement
(NREM)
with
no
subjective
experience
and
REM
sleep
with
subjective
experience
belong
to
the
same
class
in
terms
of
low
arousal
.


The
output
\({p}_{i}\)
indicates
the
probability
in
the
trial
i
of
arousal
and
awareness
.


For
the
training
and
test
phase
,
we
used
the
leave-one
participant-out
approach
as
transfer
learning
.


Therefore
,
the
EEG
data
in
the
source
pool
were
used
for
training
and
the
data
of
target
participants
was
predicted
for
arousal
or
awareness
.


The
source
pool
contains
data
corresponding
to
the
source
domain
except
for
the
target
participant
.


In
step
3
,
the
interclass
probability
for
each
arousal
and
awareness
was
averaged
for
calculating
ECI
in
each
session
j
.


The
averaged
probability
\({C}_{j}\)
is
ECI^(aro)
and
ECI^(awa)
on
the
x-
and
y-axes
,
respectively
.


Therefore
,
we
represented
the
2D
consciousness
indicator
for
the
two
components
of
consciousness
.


In
the
final
step
,
we
checked
which
brain
signals
the
model
has
learned
and
why
it
made
such
a
decision
using
layer-wise
relevance
propagation
(LRP)
.


Through
this
step
,
we
could
interpret
the
proposed
indicator
.


ECI^(awa)
=
ECI
in
awareness
component
;
ECI^(aro)
=
ECI
in
arousal
component
.

:
Overview
of
the
study
.



To
improve
the
classification
performance
,
we
trained
the
models
with
domain
transfer
learning
,
which
uses
the
knowledge
learned
in
one
domain
to
improve
generalization
,
based
on
similarity
in
the
sense
of
pooling
the
training
data
across
domains
(Supplementary
Fig
.

 4)
.


When
referring
to
domain
transfer
learning
using
the
EEG
signals
in
this
study
,
the
domain
refers
to
the
clinical
condition
in
which
the
EEG
signals
were
acquired
.


Precisely
,
three
domains
were
considered
here
:
sleep
,
anesthesia
,
and
patients
with
DoC
.


In
domain
transfer
learning
,
the
target
domain
indicates
a
state
that
contains
a
single
session
for
calculating
ECI
,
whereas
the
source
domain
indicates
those
sessions
that
are
included
in
the
training
phase
.


Therefore
,
the
information
(knowledge)
trained
in
the
source
domain
is
applied
when
testing
the
target
domain
,
and
this
is
described
as
the
transfer
of
learned
information
for
domain
transfer
learning
.


In
the
LOPO
approach
,
the
data
from
all
the
participants
in
the
source
domain
,
except
for
the
target
participant
,
were
used
for
training
(Supplementary
Fig
.

 3b)
.


Note
that
the
data
for
training
and
testing
did
not
overlap
.


We
used
all
three
domains
to
classify
high
and
low
states
in
both
arousal
and
awareness
(Table 2)
.


Consequently
,
the
classification
performance
was
higher
when
training
with
a
closer
domain
(see Supplementary
Notes 3–4
and
Supplementary
Table 4)
.


Therefore
,
we
trained
these
domains
together
when
calculating
ECI
in
sleep
and
anesthesia
domains
,
but
trained
the
DoC
domain
along
with
the
anesthesia
domain
when
calculating
ECI
in
patients
with
DoC
.

Then
,
we

data
in
two
conditions
:
(i)
general
anesthesia
and
(ii)
severely

Similarly
,
we
classified
low
and
high
states
in
resting-state
EEG
data
for
arousal
and
awareness
using
domain
transfer
learning
(Table 3)
.


This
result
was
similar
to
the
classification
performance
of
TMS–EEG
data
,
considering
that
there
was
no
resting-state
EEG
during
sleep
in
the
same
participants
(see
Supplementary
Note 4)
.


Based
on
the
results
of
domain
transfer
learning
,
we
used
only
the
anesthesia
domain
for
calculating
ECI
under
anesthesia
;
however
,
the
DoC
and
anesthesia
domains
were
used
for
calculating
ECI
in
patients
with
DoC
.

for
both
arousal

,
as
it
is
the
mean
probability
for
the
two-class

(low

.


ECI
in
NREM
sleep
showed
low
arousal

,
whereas
REM
sleep
had
low
arousal
with
high
awareness
.


ECI
in

had

We
performed

:
Characteristics
of
ECI
in
TMS–EEG
.



We
measured
ECI
using
three
anesthetic
drugs
(ketamine
,
propofol
,
and
xenon)
and
wakefulness
before
anesthesia
(Fig
.

 2b)
.


ECI
in
ketamine-induced
anesthesia
demonstrated
low
arousal
and
high
awareness
,
whereas
propofol-
and
xenon-induced
anesthesia
showed
low
arousal
and
awareness
.


Also
,
all
periods
of
wakefulness
showed
high
arousal
and
awareness
.


As
a
result
of
the
ROC
analysis
,
classification
using
ECI
achieved
an
AUC
,
sensitivity
,
and
specificity
of
1
.

0
for
all
parameters
for
both
arousal
and
awareness
(Fig
.

 2d)
.



In
patients
with
DoC
,
ECI
indicated
high
arousal
and
awareness
in
MCS
patients
and
high
arousal
and
low
awareness
in
UWS
patients
(Fig
.

 2c)
.


AUC
,
sensitivity
,
and
specificity
of
ECI
were
1
.

0
for
both
high
and
low
states
of
awareness
(Fig
.

 2d)
.


ROC
analysis
for
arousal
was
not
conducted
because
both
UWS
and
MCS
patients
were
considered
to
have
high
arousal
.


We
additionally
applied
ECI
to
four
MCS*
patients
;
these
cases
were
not
included
in
the
training
phase
.


Similar
to
patients
with
DoC
,
anesthesia
and
DoC
domains
were
selected
as
source
domains
in
the
training
phase
.


For
the
MCS*
patients
,
ECI
successfully
predicted
high
arousal
and
awareness
,
as
expected
(Supplementary
Fig
.

 5)
.



Relationship
with
PCI

We
calculated
PCI
in
TMS–EEG
sessions
that
had
at
least
80
trials
with
healthy
participants
under
sleep
,
anesthesia
,
and
brain-injury
conditions
.


PCI
in
all
three
conditions
was
consistent
with
the
optimal
cutoff
(0
.

31^(16
,17))
that
maximizes
the
accuracy
of
the
distinction
between
consciousness
and
unconsciousness
in
a
benchmark
population
.


For
ECI
,
the
optimal
cutoff
of
0
.

5
perfectly
distinguished
low
or
high
states
of
arousal
and
awareness
in
the
physiological
,
pharmacological
,
and
pathological
conditions
(see
Supplementary
Note 5)
.



We
investigated
the
relationship
between
ECI^(awa)
and
PCI
(Fig
.

 3)
.


During
sleep
,
a
positive
correlation
between
ECI^(awa)
and
PCI
was
observed
(r
=
0
.

872
,
p
<
0
.

001)
.


Similarly
,
ECI^(awa)
during
anesthesia
and
in
brain-injured
patients
showed
a
strong
correlation
with
PCI
(anesthesia
:
r
=
0
.

885
,
p
<
0
.

001
;
brain
injury
:
r
=
0
.

770
,
p
<
0
.

001)
.


ECI^(awa)
and
PCI
,
therefore
,
matched
for
all
states
.

The
practicality
of
calculating
ECI

We
explored
the
possibility
of
calculating
ECI
with
a
limited
number
of
trials
during
sleep
and
wakefulness
.


The
classification
performance
was
compared
through
the
calculation
of
ECI
from
a
single
trial
up
to
the
standard
number
of
trials
(i
.

e
.


,
80
trials
similar
to
PCI¹⁶)
(Fig
.

 5)
.


In
the
sleep
and
healthy
wakefulness
conditions
,
the
performance
reached
a
specificity
of
0
.

853
,
a
sensitivity
of
0
.

884
,
and
an
AUC
of
0
.

931
when
using
single
trials
(based
on
one
TMS
pulse)
,
but
from
2
trials
,
it
was
above
0
.

9
for
specificity
,
sensitivity
,
and
AUC
.


In
the
anesthesia
and
patients
with
DoC
conditions
,
the
detailed
performance
from
1
to
80
trials
is
shown
in
Supplementary

.

according

Figure 6
shows
the
possibility
of
awareness
being
high
for
the
first
participant
in
each
of
these
conditions
:
sleep
,
anesthesia
(ketamine
,
propofol
,
and
xenon)
,
and
patients
with
DoC
(UWS
and
MCS)
.


For
instance
,
as
NREM
sleep
is
considered
to
have
low
awareness
,
in
P01
,
it
was
correctly
predicted
when
the
probability
in
a
single
trial
was
less
than
0
.

5
.


Notably
,
NREM
sleep
showed
that
17
trials
were
incorrectly
predicted
with
a
probability
higher
than
0
.

5
.


In
addition
,
1
out
of
80
trials
in
both
REM
sleep
and
healthy
wakefulness
showed
a
value
less
than
0
.

5
and
were
incorrectly
predicted
.


This
indicates
that
ECI
can
be
predicted
as
somewhat
low
or
high
,
even
in
a
single
trial
.


There
was
a
clear
spatiotemporal
difference
between
correct
and
incorrect
trials
only
in
parietal
regions
(Supplementary
Fig
.

 6)
.


No
significant
differences
between
both
types
of
trials
were
observed
over
frontal
and
temporal
regions
.


However
,
in
parietal
regions
,
TMS-evoked
potentials
at
350–400
ms
were
significantly
higher
in
incorrect
trials
than
in
correct
trials
.


In
a
single
trial
,
these
different
patterns
resulted
in
misprediction
.


Nevertheless
,
the
effect
of
the
incorrect
trials
(i
.

e
.


,
a
failure
to
predict)
was
eliminated
because
ECI
was
calculated
by
averaging
the
interclass
probability
in
a
single
trial
.


The
probability
in
a
single
trial
is
shown
in
Supplementary
Figs
.

 7–9
for
other
participants
in
all
conditions
.



[figure

We
depicted
the

To
demonstrate
that
the
method
can
be
easily
applied
to
a
new
set
of
patients
(without
additional
training)
to
identify
their
state
of
consciousness
in

setting
,
we
computed
ECI
using
the
hold-out

In

These

Interpretation
for
calculating
ECI

We
further
checked
what
the
classifier
learned
through
CNN
and
how
it
was
able
to
derive
those
results
using
LRP
.


This
algorithm
describes
the
predictions
of
CNN
in
a
given
dataset
using
relevance
scores³⁰
.


Figure 7
shows
the
relevance
scores
for
arousal
and
awareness
among
the
frontal
,
temporal
,
and
parietal
regions
at
the
scalp
level
for
calculating
ECI
using
TMS–EEG
.


A
high
relevance
score
implies
that
the
trained
model
recognized
the
brain
region
that
determines
whether
it
is
low
or
high
arousal
and
awareness
.


Specifically
,
brain
regions
with
higher
relevance
scores
indicate
that
brain
signals
over
that
region
contributed
more
to
the
decision
of
the
classifier
on
whether
arousal
and
awareness
were
low
or
high
.


In
the
three
conditions
(sleep
,
anesthesia
,
and
patients
with
DoC)
,
the
relevance
score
over
the
parietal
region
was
higher
than
those
in
the
frontal
and
temporal
regions
at
the
group
level
for
both
arousal
and
awareness
.


The
detailed
statistical
results
are
reported
in
Supplementary
Table 5
.


However
,
since
most
TMS
sites
targeted
the
parietal
cortex
,
it
can
be
argued
that
the
relevance
of
parietal
regions
to
correctly
classify
datasets
may
be
biased
.


Therefore
,
we
investigated
the
relevance
scores
with
only
non-parietal
stimulations
in
patients
with
DoC
.


As
a
result
,
the
parietal
region
had
statistically
higher
relevance
scores
than
the
frontal
and
temporal
regions
in
both
arousal
and
awareness
(Supplementary
Fig
.

 11
and
Table 6)
.


Similarly
,
there
was
a
higher
relevance
score
over
the
parietal
region
in
both
arousal
and
awareness
when
calculating
ECI
from
resting-state
EEG
(Supplementary

Discussion

We
show
that
ECI
clearly
distinguishes
between
low
and
high
states
of
arousal
and
awareness
in
TMS–EEG
results
under
sleep
,
anesthesia
,
and
patients
with
DoC
.


Our
results
suggest
that
this
proposed
indicator
could
similarly
be
used
for
resting-state
EEG
data
without
TMS
under
anesthesia
and
patients
with
DoC
,
yielding
the
same
degree
of
accuracy
.


In
addition
,
a
high
correlation
with
PCI
,
which
measures
the
integrated
EEG
response
of
the
thalamocortical
system
to
a
direct
perturbation
induced
by
TMS¹⁶
,
proves
that
ECI^(awa)
is
reliable
using
TMS–EEG
data
.


It
also
shows
that
the
two
measures
calculated
entirely
independently
using
different
methods
resulted
in
the
same
conclusion
,
which
is
a
sign
that
deep
learning
is
indeed
a
valid
and
reliable
approach
.


For
an
ML-based
indicator
,
ECI
can
be
calculated
using
very
few
trials
.


Furthermore
,
because
the
classifier
learned
specific
features
of
the
data
on
its
own
,
our
indicator
can
be
computed
regardless
of
whether
TMS
is
applied
or
its
location
.


Therefore
,
ECI
is
a
significantly
practical
and
reliable
indicator
to
evaluate
levels
of
consciousness
under
various
conditions
.


Our
analyses
using
LRP
highlighted
the
major
role
of
the
parietal
region
in
determining
consciousness
,
as
the
classifier
primarily
uses
brain
activity
in
this
lobe
for
predicting
low
and
high
states
of
arousal
and
awareness
.



TMS–EEG
responses
under
sleep
exhibited
well-known
phenomena³¹
.


In
wakefulness
,
TMS
generates
a
series
of
low-amplitude
high-frequency
activities
related
to
cortical
flow
in
long-range
connections³²
.


A
similar
long-lasting
response
is
evoked
during
REM
sleep
with
subjective
experience³³
.


During
NREM
sleep
with
no
subjective
experience
,
TMS
triggers
larger
,
low-frequency
activity
that
quickly
dissipates³²
,
which
is
the
hallmark
of
bistability
in
the
thalamocortical
system
.


Cortical
effective
connectivity
is
also
broken
down
during
NREM
sleep^(33
,34)
.


The
brain
response
to
TMS
perturbation
was
already
used
to
distinguish
the
levels
of
awareness
,
irrespective
of
sensory
processing
and
motor
responses
under
physiological
,
pharmacological
,
and
pathological
conditions^(34
,35
,36)
.


Therefore
,
this
TMS-evoked
response
was
applied
to
our
end-to-end
CNN
framework
.


Similar
to
several
studies
using
ML
,
we
observed
higher
two-class
(low
or
high)
classification
accuracy
using
CNN
when
compared
to
linear
discriminant
analysis
(LDA)
and
support
vector
machine
(SVM)
for
both
arousal
and
awareness
.


This
suggests
that
our
framework
is
especially
relevant
for
EEG
results
,
which
possess
several
nonlinear
features
.


The
classification
performance
of
spatiotemporal
information
was
higher
than
that
of
spatio-spectral
information
.


Using
our
framework
,
it
was
shown
that
temporal
information
discriminates
different
levels
of
consciousness
more
clearly
than
spectral
information
,
as
the
functional
connectivity
associated
with
consciousness
changes
in
both
space
and
time³⁷
.


However
,
this
does
not
imply
that
temporal
information
is
more
important
than
spectral
information
for
distinguishing
consciousness
.


Temporal
information
has
more
distinct
characteristics
than
spectral
information
for
predicting
the
state
of
consciousness
in
the
proposed
framework
.


Nevertheless
,
PCI
also
used
spatiotemporal
dynamics
in
TMS-evoked
responses¹⁶
,
which
is
significantly
important
for
distinguishing
consciousness
.



We
applied
transfer
learning
to
a
single
domain
as
well
as
multiple
domains
.


In
the
sleep
domain
,
classification
performance
was
high
when
trained
on
only
the
sleep
domain
or
together
with
the
anesthesia
domain
.


Due
to
a
large
number
of
trials
in
the
sleep
domain
,
training
was
performed
satisfactorily
using
only
sleep
data
.


The
distance
of
the
averaged
TMS-evoked
potentials
under
the
domains
of
anesthesia
and
sleep
was
significantly
close
,
which
indicated
that
the
two
domains
were
highly
similar³⁸
.


Thus
,
a
close
distance
implies
that
the
two
domains
have
similar
patterns
,
and
the
classification
performance
indeed
increased
when
these
domains
were
trained
together
.


In
the
anesthesia
and
DoC
domains
,
the
trials
of
a
single
domain
were
not
sufficient
;
thus
a
higher
classification
performance
was
achieved
when
trained
with
similar
domains
.


In
addition
,
brain
signals
change
over
time
,
even
when
recorded
with
the
same
participants
because
of
physiological
and
psychological
differences
over
time²⁷
.


Therefore
,
participant-independent
learning
such
as
the
LOPO
cross-validation
is
considerably
difficult
,
as
opposed
to
participant-dependent
learning²⁴
.


We
solved
these
problems
via
transfer
learning
utilizing
multiple
domains
and
participant-independent
ECI
.



ECI
,
by
averaging
interclass
probability
,
distinguished
whether
each
state
was
low
or
high
in
both
arousal
and
awareness
.


Because
of
its
inherently
high
two-class
performance
,
it
was
possible
to
calculate
the
discriminable
ECI
using
a
few
trials
in
a
single
session
.


The
criteria
used
for
determining
ECI^(aro)
and
ECI^(awa)
were
different
,
especially
for
REM
sleep
,
ketamine-induced
anesthesia
,
and
UWS
patients
.


Although
the
dataset
was
the
same
,
these
states
were
trained
by
different
labels
depending
on
arousal
and
awareness
.


For
instance
,
REM
sleep
is
high
in
awareness
but
low
in
arousal
.


The
proposed
classifier
learns
models
for
these
different
criteria
by
training
itself
based
on
the
criteria
of
arousal
and
awareness
.


Specifically
,
because
the
learning
ability
of
the
CNN
is
derived
from
the
automatic
extraction
of
complicated
representations
from
EEG
signals³⁹
,
it
can
properly
distinguish
between
both
states
,
even
if
the
same
state
has
different
labels
depending
on
the
criteria
.


We
further
used
data
from
MCS*
patients
as
verification
samples
.


MCS*
patients
were
correctly
predicted
,
since
data
from
UWS
and
MCS
patients
were
included
during
training
,
and
the
classifier
is
independent
of
behavior
.



According
to
the
LRP
,
we
observed
higher
relevance
scores
in
the
parietal
regions
,
compared
to
other
regions
at
the
scalp
level
.


This
was
observed
for
all
data
,
including
TMS–EEG
and
resting-state
EEG
results
.


The
brain
regions
that
led
to
decision-making
were
similar
in
arousal
and
awareness
.


However
,
this
does
not
imply
that
arousal
and
awareness
are
supported
by
the
same
underlying
neurophysiological
mechanisms
.


The
relevance
scores
simply
explain
the
patterns
of
cortical
EEG
activity
resulting
in
this
classification
.



In
sleep
and
healthy
wakefulness
,
when
arousal
and
awareness
were
high
,
they
were
highly
relevant
in
the
parietal
region
.


This
EEG
feature
,
which
distinguishes
high
and
low
states
in
arousal
and
awareness
,
can
be
interpreted
in
line
with
the
posterior
hot
zone
of
consciousness⁴⁰
.


Local
changes
in
this
parietal
region
are
associated
with
the
occurrence
of
dreaming
and
unconscious
sleep^(41
,42)
,
and
our
framework
may
learn
from
EEG
pivotal
features
recorded
in
this
area
.


The
importance
of
the
posterior
hot
zone
has
already
been
emphasized
using
the
within-state
sleep
paradigm^(43
,44)
.


Similar
to
sleep
,
we
observed
high
relevance
scores
for
the
parietal
region
in
the
domains
of
both
anesthesia
and
patients
with
DoC
.


This
implies
that
EEG
activity
in
this
region
had
a
decisive
effect
in
determining
the
high
and
low
states
of
arousal
and
awareness
.


The
increased
slow-wave
activity
was
observed
under
propofol-
and
xenon-induced
anesthesia
when
compared
to
healthy
wakefulness
before
drug
administration³⁶
.


In
addition
,
just
as
cortical
neurons
induced
bistable
changes
during
NREM
sleep
,
TMS
in
propofol-mediated
anesthesia-induced
low-amplitude
,
low-frequency
,
positive–negative
potentials
,
and
TMS
in
xenon-mediated
anesthesia
caused
a
significantly
large
amplitude
but
stereotyped
positive–negative
deflection³⁶
.


Moreover
,
under
ketamine-induced
anesthesia
,
TMS-evoked
response
was
determined
to
be
similar
to
REM
sleep
,
which
features
dreaming
during
a
low
state
of
arousal³⁶
.


Previous
studies
have
shown
that
the
change
in
slow
waves
induced
by
propofol
is
primarily
observed
in
the
posterior
hot
zone⁴⁵
and
the
posterior
main
hub
is
disrupted
during
anesthesia-induced
alteration
of
consciousness⁷
.


In
UWS
patients
,
TMS
triggered
a
local
and
slow
response
similar
to
NREM
sleep
and
general
anesthesia
,
whereas
MCS
patients
showed
complex
TMS-evoked
responses³³
.


Similarly
,
differences
in
alpha
connectivity
between
the
UWS
and
MCS
patients
are
apparent
within
the
posterior
hot
zone⁴⁶
.


That
is
,
when
determining
whether
arousal
and
awareness
are
low
or
high
,
our
classifiers
used
differences
and
changes
in
EEG
activity
over
the
parietal
region
to
make
decisions
.


Particularly
,
similar
results
were
observed
in
patients
with
DoC
using
several
TMS
target
sites
,
and
in
sleep
and
anesthesia
domains
,
where
the
parietal
region
was
primarily
stimulated
.


This
suggests
that
our
findings
regarding
the
parietal
region
are
unrelated
to
the
TMS
target
site
.


Thus
,
our
trained
model
used
neurophysiological
features
to
classify
whether
arousal
and
awareness
are
low
or
high
.


This
indicates
an
appropriate
design
of
our
model
as
the
classification
decision
was
primarily
based
on
EEG
signals
over
the
parietal
region
,
which
is
suggested
to
be
a
hot
spot
of
consciousness
,
compared
to
the
frontal
region⁴³
.


The
difference
in
the
parietal
region
could
be
clearly
identified
through
correct
trials
during
sleep
and
healthy
wakefulness
.


It
is
meaningful
that
the
frontal
region
contributed
less
than
parietal
regions
in
the
context
of
the
controversy
regarding
the
spatial
localization
of
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness^(40
,45)
.


Considering
the
subcortical
influences
related
to
striatal-thalamic
circuits
,
it
has
been
recently
observed
that
the
parietal
region
contributes
more
to
the
levels
of
consciousness
than
the
frontal
region⁴⁷
.


The
implication
of
the
parietal
cortex
in
consciousness
has
also
been
demonstrated
in
other
neuroimaging
modalities
,
such
as
functional
magnetic
resonance
imaging⁴⁸
and
magnetoencephalography⁴⁹
.



This
study
does
have
certain
limitations
.


First
,
our
sample
size
was
relatively
small
.


In
the
future
,
it
will
be
necessary
to
further
test
the
reliability
of
the
proposed
indicator
with
larger
cohorts
and
validate
it
at
the
clinical
level
before
implementing
it
in
a
clinical
setting
.


Sleep
experiments
would
also
have
to
be
applied
to
more
participants
in
the
future
.


Second
,
we
explored
the
possibility
of
calculating
ECI
with
a
minimal
amount
of
data
,
up
to
a
single
trial
.


However
,
we
did
not
attempt
to
measure
ECI
in
real
time
.


Thus
,
in
the
future
,
ECI
could
be
calculated
in
real-time
for
practical
application
.


Third
,
ECI
does
not
differentiate
between
physiological
,
pharmacological
,
and
pathological
conditions
,
but
distinguishes
between
high
and
low
states
of
arousal
and
awareness
.


ECI
can
thus
distinguish
between
REM
sleep
(or
ketamine)
and
wakefulness
.


It
may
also
be
difficult
to
select
the
model
to
use
when
calculating
ECI
since
the
domain
has
to
be
known
beforehand
.


Nevertheless
,
if
a
single
domain
has
sufficient
trials
,
the
LOPO
approach
would
be
the
most
accurate
.


Another
limitation
might
be
related
to
the
possible
contamination
of
TMS-EEG
data
by
auditory
and
somatosensory
components
.


As
in
previous
studies^(17
,35
,36)
,
to
avoid
auditory
and
somatosensory
co-stimulation
,
participants
wore
earphones
with
noise
masking
and
a
thin
foam
between
the
scalp
and
the
TMS
coil
that
was
used
.


Although
it
is
difficult
to
systematically
rule
out
the
contribution
of
sensory
co-stimulation
in
every
measurement
,
the
application
of
effective
noise-masking
procedures⁵⁰
and
the
real-time
monitoring
of
data
quality
during
the
acquisition⁵¹
may
significantly
mitigate
this
issue⁵²
.


Finally
,
ECI
indicates
whether
arousal
and
awareness
are
low
or
high
and
cannot
be
considered
functional
.


It
,
therefore
,
should
be
developed
into
a
functional
index
.



In
conclusion
,
we
proposed
ECI
as
a
neurophysiological
indicator
to
simultaneously
discriminate
the
levels
of
arousal
and
awareness
in
modified
states
of
consciousness
.


This
tool
allows
disentangling
the
levels
of
consciousness
,
with
a
single
measure
,
in
different
clinical
settings
such
as
monitoring
surgical
interventions
(i
.

e
.


,
anesthesia-induced
states)
and
diagnosing
patients
with
DoC
.


This
indicator
was
validated
under
different
physiological
,
pharmacological
,
and
pathological
conditions
,
and
it
reliably
disentangled
low
levels
from
high
levels
of
both
arousal
and
awareness
.


Besides
,
the
proposed
ECI
is
considerably
accessible
and
practical
,
as
it
can
be
applied
to
resting-state
EEG
without
TMS
,
and
requires
fewer
trials
.


Therefore
,
the
proposed
indicator
can
be
a
reliable
discriminator
and
valuable
tool
as
an
objective
measure
of
consciousness
.


As
parietal
regions
appear
to
be
the
most
relevant
for
classification
,
an
EEG
configuration
around
that
area
could
be
sufficient
if
ECI
is
used
in
clinical
practice
.


These
findings
could
be
useful
in
diagnosing
severely
brain-injured
patients
and
monitoring
their
levels
of
consciousness
in
real-time
,
especially
in
clinical
settings
where
time
constraints
preclude
long-duration
assessment
.


The
proposed
reliable
ECI
can
provide
insights
into
the
classification
of
conscious
levels
using
deep
learning
and
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
.

following
the
American
Academy
of
Sleep
Medicine
Scoring
Manual
.


After
3
min
or
more
,
when
the
participant
entered
a
specific
sleep
stage
,
TMS
was
applied
over
the
parietal
cortex
using
a
navigated
brain
stimulation
system
(eXimia

.


Supplementary
Table 8
lists
the

The
participants
were
awoken
by
an
alarm
sound
that
lasted
for
1
.

5
s
after
each
session
.


They
were
then
asked
if
they
had
had
conscious

.


The
TMS–EEG
experiments
were
performed
over

of
four
or
five
nights
per
participant
.



The
anesthesia

Sixteen
healthy
participants
(eight
males
,
aged
18–28
years)
were
included
under
ketamine-
(n
=
6)
,
propofol-
(n
=
5)
,
and
xenon-induced
(n
=

anesthesia
.


The
inclusion
criteria
included
(i)
older
than
18
years
and
(ii)
stability
of
vital
parameters
.


The
exclusion
criteria
were
as
follows
:
(i)
neurological
,
cardiovascular
,
psychiatric
,
and
mood
disorders
,
(ii)
contraindications
for
TMS
(e

,
and
(iii)
medical
conditions
that
were
incompatible
with
the
anesthesia
and/or
the
TMS
procedure
.


This
experimental

(2009/153
(ketamine)
,
2007/191
(propofol)
,
and

;
moreover
,
all
participants
provided
written
informed
consent
.


TMS
was
applied
over
the
left
parietal
or
motor
regions
after
participants
reached
deep
unresponsiveness
(a
score
equal
to
5
in
the
Ramsay
scale
,
which
corresponds
to
no
response
to
external

following
standard
anesthetic
procedures³⁶
.


The

Table 9
.


In
addition
,
upon
waking
up
from
anesthesia
,
reports
about
the
conscious
experience
during
anesthesia
were
collected
.


Conclusively
,
the
participants
reported
little
conscious
experience
during
propofol-
and
xenon-induced
anesthesia
,
but
vivid
dreams
were
experienced
during
ketamine-induced

All
of
them
fell
into
a

and
presented
a

criteria
included
(i)
older

significant
neurological
,
neurosurgical
,
or

.


The
FDG-PET
is
a
reliable
and
sensitive
tool
to
detect

and
all

moreover
,
newly

data
used
exactly
the

procedure
as
before
.


These
added
data
were
recently
acquired
by
Dr
.


Olivia
Gosseries

Steven
Laureys
team
at
the
University
of

.


For
the
added
data
,
the
inclusion
and
exclusion
criteria
for
patients
were
exactly
the
same
as
the
previously
used
data
.


These
data
are
part
of
a
bigger
study
conducted
in
the
frame
of
the
Human
Brain
Project
.


The
final
dataset
consisted
of
15
UWS
patients
,
15
MCS
patients
,
and
4
MCS*
patients
.


The
detailed
demographic
and
clinical
information
of
severely
brain-injured
patients
is
listed
in
Supplementary
Table 10
.


The
TMS
target
site
was
selected
using
a
neuronavigation
system
over
the
parietal
,
motor
,
or
premotor
regions
,
avoiding
structural
lesions
using
the
magnetic
resonance
imaging
data
of
the
patient
.


The
stimuli
target
sites
for
all
participants
are
listed
in
Supplementary
Table 11
.


The
participants
remained
awake
or
were
kept
awake
using
the
CRS-R
arousal
protocol
in
between
TMS
stimulation¹²
.



For
the
four
datasets
,
EEG
data
were
recorded
using
a
60-channel
TMS-compatible
amplifier
and
a
two-channel
electrooculogram
(Nexstim
eXimia
,
Nexstim
Plc
,
Finland)
with
a
1450
Hz
sampling
rate
.


During
all
the
sessions
,
earphones
presenting
white
noise
were
used
to
reduce
the
noise
of
the
TMS
pulses
and
we
used
a
thin
foam
between
the
scalp
and
the
TMS
coil
to
avoid
somatosensory
evoked
potentials
.


These
pulses
were
presented
at
random
intervals
of
2–2
.

3
s
using
a
figure-of-eight
coil
.


The
maximum
electric
field
was
between
100
and
130
V/m
at
the
TMS
target
site
.


In
particular
,
the
TMS
stimulation
was
always
performed
in
the
medial
half
of
one
hemisphere
,
to
avoid
any
muscle
artifacts
.



Finally
,
we
used
resting-state
EEG
without
TMS
for
the
domains
of
anesthesia
and
severely
brain-injured
patients
.


These
data
were
acquired
using
the
same
participants
as
in
the
TMS–EEG
experiments
.


We
used
the
ketamine-
(n
=
5)
,
propofol-
(n
=
5)
,
and
xenon-induced
anesthesia
data
(n
=
5)
as
previously
reported
by
Sarasso
et
al
.

³⁶
.


For
at
least
3
min
before
the
TMS–EEG
experiments
,
resting-state
EEG
data
were
recorded
during
anesthesia
and
each
state
of
wakefulness
before
the
anesthesia
.


With
regard
to
the
severely
brain-injured
patients
,
5-min
resting-state
EEG
for
MCS
patients
(n
=
15)
and
UWS
patients
(n
=
15)
was
included
.


In
addition
,
four
MCS*
patients
were
added
along
with
the
same
participants
for
whom
TMS–EEG
was
recorded
.


The
sampling
rate
was
1450
Hz
.


Finally
,
among
previously
published
data
,
the
data
with
a
signal-to-noise
of
1
.

4
or
less
were
excluded
from
the
analysis¹⁶
.



Data
preprocessing

TMS–EEG
data
were
preprocessed
using
the
SiSyPhus
Project
MATLAB
program
(University
of
Milan
,
Italy)
and
the
EEGLAB
toolbox⁵⁷
.


The
signals
were
down-sampled
to
362
.

5
Hz
and
band-pass
filtered
between
0
.

5
and
45
Hz
using
a
second-order
Butterworth
filter
.


The
signals
of
−400
to
1000
ms
were
segmented
and
baseline-corrected
using
the
400
ms
baseline
before
the
TMS
pulses
.


Bad
channels
were
manually
detected
and
interpolated
using
superfast
spherical
interpolation
for
artifact
removal
.


We
also
discarded
the
components
related
to
eye
movements
using
independent
component
analysis
and
removed
trials
setting
a
threshold
of
±100
μv
affected
by
ocular
artifacts
,
other
artifacts
,
or
noise
.


The
data
were
re-referenced
to
an
average
reference^(58
,59)
.



Resting-state
EEG
data
were
processed
using
the
EEGLAB
toolbox⁵⁷
.


Preprocessing
was
performed
using
a
process
similar
to
that
used
with
TMS–EEG
data
,
with
segmentation
being
performed
every
1
s
.


The
number
of
trials
for
each
session
we
used
is
listed
for
patients
under
anesthesia
(Supplementary
Table 12)
and
severely
brain-injured
patients
(Supplementary
Table 13)
.



Proposed
framework
for
calculating
an
ECI

Step
1—Extraction
of
EEG
features
:
In
all
trials
of
all
TMS–EEG
data
,
we
used
the
200–400
ms
time
window
of
data
after
the
TMS
regardless
of
the
lateralization
or
target
site
of
the
TMS
in
sleep
,
anesthesia
,
and
for
patients
with
severe
brain
injury
.


More
details
related
to
this
deliberate
choice
are
reported
in
Supplementary
Note 2
.


In
resting-state
EEG
,
only
the
first
200
ms
of
data
were
used
from
the
segmented
1
s
of
data
.


In
the
first
step
,
EEG
data
were
converted
from
2D
raw
signals
to
3D
input
.


To
preserve
the
spatial
information
and
characteristics
of
EEG
,
we
used
spatio-spectral
and
spatiotemporal
3D
features
.


The
raw
EEG
signals
at
time
index
t
are
measured
in
a
1D
data
vector
\({r}_{t}={\left[{s}_{t}^{1}
,{s}_{t}^{2}
,{s}_{t}^{i}
,\cdots

,{s}_{t}^{n}\right]}^{T}\)
,
where
\({s}_{t}^{i}\)
is
the
acquisition
data
by
the
\(i\)th
electrode
channel
at
timestamp
t
.


n
indicates
the
number
of
electrode
channels
.


However
,
these
simple
signals
do
not
capture
all
the
spatial
information
characteristics
in
the
brain
.


Therefore
,
we
converted
1D
data
vectors
to
2D
EEG
data
meshes
using
the
spatial
information
of
the
electrode
location
.


Zero
was
inserted
in
the
place
of
a
null
electrode
in
2D
matrices
at
time
index
t⁶⁰
.


Finally
,
we
calculated
3D
data
by
adding
spectral
or
temporal
information
(Supplementary
Fig
.

 14)
.


Specifically
,
spectral
information
was
divided
into
5
frequency
bands
:
delta
(1
.

5–4
Hz)
,
theta
(4–8
Hz)
,
alpha
(8–13
Hz)
,
beta
(13–30
Hz)
,
and
gamma
bands
(30–40
Hz)⁴⁴
.


Finally
,
a
10
×
11
×
5
matrix
using
spectral
information
and a
10
×
11
×
72
matrix
using
temporal
information
were
used
as
the
final
CNN
inputs
(here
,
10
×
11
:
the
converted
matrix
of
spatial
information
;
5
:
delta
,
theta
,
alpha
,
beta
,
and
gamma
bands
of
spectral
information
;
72
:
200–400
ms
of
temporal
information)
.



Step
2—Calculation
of
interclass
probability
using
CNN
:
The
model
was
trained
to
distinguish
both
arousal
and
awareness
in
terms
of
whether
they
were
low
or
high
.


We
first
calculated
the
domain
similarity
based
on
the
cosine
distance
for
domain
transfer
learning
.


The
cosine
distance
D
between
domains
A
and
B
is
defined
as
follows
:

$$D\left(A
,\
,B\right)=1-\
,\frac{{f}_{A}^{{{{\rm
T}}}}{f}_{B}}{\parallel
{f}_{A}\parallel
\parallel
{f}_{B}\parallel}$$

(1)

where
\(\parallel
\bullet
\parallel\)
indicates
the
norm
of
a
vector
.


This
similarity
was
used
when
selecting
the
source
domain
for
domain
transfer
learning³⁸
.


In
calculating
the
similarity
according
to
the
states
of
arousal
and
awareness
,
the
labels
in
each
state
are
different
.


During
sleep
,
NREM
sleep
with
no
subjective
experience
and
REM
sleep
with
subjective
experience
were
learned
as
low
arousal
,
whereas
healthy
wakefulness
was
learned
as
high
arousal
.


Conversely
,
in
awareness
,
REM
sleep
with
subjective
experience
and
healthy
wakefulness
indicated
by
open
eyes
were
learned
as
high
awareness
,
while
NREM
sleep
with
no
subjective
experience
was
learned
as
low
awareness
.


Specifically
,
we
used
stage
3
of
NREM
sleep
for
clear
feature
extraction
of
deep
sleep
.


Under
general
anesthesia
and
in
healthy
wakefulness
before
anesthesia
,
the
arousal
state
was
divided
as
follows
:
(i)
low
,
when
under
ketamine
,
propofol
,
and
xenon-induced
anesthesia
,
and
(ii)
high
,
when
in
healthy
wakefulness
before
anesthesia
.


Conversely
,
the
awareness
state
was
divided
into
low
(under
propofol
and
xenon-induced
anesthesia)
and
high
(under
ketamine-induced
anesthesia
and
healthy
wakefulness
before
anesthesia)
.


Finally
,
in
patients
with
DoC
,
UWS
and
MCS
patients
were
distinguished
in
terms
of
awareness
:
low
(UWS
patients)
and
high
(MCS
patients)
.


The
UWS
and
MCS
patients
corresponded
to
high
arousal
.



Deep
learning
was
conducted
in
a
MATLAB
environment
powered
by
a
TITAN
V
GPU
.


We
used
the
LRP
toolbox³⁰
for
CNN
classification
and
interpretation
.


The
CNN
was
applied
to
the
two
components
of
consciousness
(arousal
and
awareness)
.


In
each
architecture
,
we
inserted
five
convolutional
layers
with
2D
filters
for
the
deep
neural
network
.


The
first
layer
with
100
filters
and
the
second
layer
with
80
filters
featured
kernel
sizes
of
3
×
3
and
2
×
2
with
stride
1
×
1
,
respectively
.


Then
,
a
max-pooling
layer
with
a
pool
size
of
2
×
2
and
stride
1
×
2
was
added
.


Similarly
,
two
convolutional
layers
with
kernel
sizes
of
3
×
3
(with
stride
1
×
1)
and
2
×
2
(with
stride
2
×
1)
were
subsequently
used
.


After
max-pooling
with
a
pool
size
of
2
×
1
and
stride
2
×
1
,
a
final
convolutional
layer
comprising
two
filters
with
a
kernel
size
of
1
×
1
and
stride
1
×
1
was
incorporated
.


Finally
,
the
generated
feature
maps
were
flattened
into
a
1D
vector
.


A
softmax
layer
was
used
for
classification
.


In
the
softmax
layer
,
each
element
indicates
the
probability
that
the
original
input
belongs
to
the
corresponding
class
.


In
this
training
procedure
,
the
parameters
in
the
deep
neural
network
were
learned
through
back-propagation
.


The
activation
function
in
each
convolutional
layer
was
a
rectified
linear
unit
.


The
detailed
CNN
architecture
is
presented
in
Supplementary
Table 14
.


The
Adam
optimizer
was
used
with
an
initial
learning
rate
of
0
.

005
,
and
the
learning
rate
was
updated
to
sublinear
for
learning
rate
decay
during
an
evaluation
step
of
training
.


Specifically
,
we
used
hyperparameters
as
values
of
0
.

9
for
β1
,
0
.

999
for
β2
for
Adam
optimizer⁶¹
.


The
batch
size
was
25
for
training
,
and
the
maximum
number
of
training
iterations
was
five
times
the
number
of
training
data
.


Consequently
,
the
output
of
this
architecture
was
the
probability
of
each
class
.



For
a
comparison
with
other
classifiers
,
we
also
considered
an
LDA
classifier⁶²
and
SVM
with
polynomial
kernel
function⁶³
using
the
same
input
data
as
fair
baseline
methods
.


The
classification
performance
was
measured
in
LOPO-nested
cross-validation
for
the
generalized
neural
network
.


This
method
is
a
special
case
of
k-fold
cross-validation
.


Specifically
,
all
participants
except
one
(the
target
participant)
were
used
for
training
,
and
the
target
participant
was
then
tested
using
the
classifier
.


In
the
training
phase
,
80%
of
the
datasets
were
used
to
learn
the
classifier
,
and
the
remaining
20%
were
reserved
for
validation
.


This
process
was
repeated
for
each
participant
.


Further
,
internal
validation
sets
(inner
cross-validation)
were
performed
to
choose
the
hyperparameters
of
the
model⁶⁴
.


Thus
,
the
same
hyperparameters
were
selected
in
the
external
validation
sets⁶⁵
.


The
LOPO
cross-validation
procedure
uses
data
efficiently
and
can
reduce
overfitting
.


It
also
provides
unbiased
estimates
of
the
averaged
classification
error
for
all
possible
training
sets⁶⁶
.


The
same
LOPO-nested
cross-validation
is
applied
in
LDA
and
SVM
using
the
Berlin
brain–computer
interface
toolbox⁶⁷
.


Three
possible
values
(0
.

0001
,
0
.

01
,
and
1)
were
chosen
as
penalties
for
misclassification
in
the
SVM
model⁶⁵
.


For
spatio-spectral
input
and
spatiotemporal
input
1
and
0
.

0001
were
used
respectively
.



Step
3—Calculation
of
ECI
in
a
single
session
:
We
obtained
each
interclass
probability
according
to
two
components
(arousal
and
awareness)
at
the
previous
step
.


In
each
TMS
session
,
the
interclass
probability
was
averaged
to
calculate
an
ECI
.


This
approach
has
the
advantage
of
being
able
to
offset
outliers
.



$${C}_{j}=\
,\frac{1}{N}\mathop{\sum
}\limits_{i=1}^{N}{p}_{i}$$

(2)

Here
,
\({p}_{i}\)
is
the
probability
of
high
arousal
or
high
awareness
from
each
trial
\(i\)
among
the
probability
values
(high
versus
low)
for
the
two
classes
from
the
softmax
function
in
the
CNN
.


N
is
the
number
of
trials
in
a
single
session
j
.


The
averaged
interclass
probability
\({C}_{j}\)
from
arousal
is
the
value
of
the
x-axis
as
ECI^(aro)
,
and
the
averaged
interclass
probability
\({C}_{j}\)
from
awareness
becomes
the
value
of
the
y-axis
as
ECI^(awa)
.


Consequently
,
ECI
is
expressed
as
a
2D
indicator
representing
both
arousal
and
awareness
simultaneously
.


As
mentioned
earlier
,
we
used
the
LOPO
cross-validation
.


It
is
to
be
noted
that
only
data
from
one
participant
were
used
as
the
test
,
and
the
data
from
the
remaining
participants
were
used
for
training
.


Finally
,
the
test
and
training
data
did
not
demonstrate
an
overlap
at
all
.



Step
4—Interpretation
using
LRP
:
We
used
LRP
based
on
a
backward-propagation
mechanism
for
interpretability
of
the
deep
neural
networks
.


This
calculated
the
pixel-based
decomposition
process²⁸
.



$$\mathop{\sum
}\limits_{p=1}^{d}{R}_{p}=f({{{{{\rm{x}}}}}})$$

(3)

Here
,
x
=
(\({x}_{1}
,\ldots
{x}_{d}\))
indicates
an
input
vector
and
\(f({{{{{\rm{x}}}}}})\)
is
the
model
output
.


The
relevance
score
\({R}_{p}\)
is
the
decomposition
of
the
prediction
for
the
input
\({x}_{p}\)
.


This
score
is
calculated
through
the
backward
propagation
of
the
model
input
.


Therefore
,
relevance
scores
describe
a
single
nonlinear
decision
for
the
output
corresponding
to
each
input⁶⁸
.


Through
this
method
,
we
can
observe
not
only
the
interpretation
of
classification
decisions
but
also
what
features
the
model
has
learned²⁸
.


To
investigate
which
brain
regions
and
signals
caused
these
classification
results
,
we
compared
the
relevance
scores
from
the
LRP
by
dividing
them
into
the
following
three
regions⁶⁹
:
the
frontal
(Fp1–2
,
Fpz
,
AF1–2
,
AFz
,
F1–8
,
and
Fz)
,
temporal
(FT9–10
,
T7–8
,
TP9–10)
,
and
parietal
(CP1–6
,
CPz
,
P1–4
,
P7–8
,
and
Pz)
regions
.


We
focused
on
the
frontal
,
temporal
,
and
parietal
regions
when
comparing
the
relevance
score
resulting
from
the
LRP
as
there
is
an
ongoing
debate
regarding
which
brain
area
,
i
.

e
.


,
the
front
versus
the
back
,
is
related
to
consciousness⁴⁰
.


We
also
included
the
temporal
region
as
activation
in
the
NREM
sleep
increases
in
this
region⁷⁰
.



Additional
EEG
analyses
are
shown
in Supplementary
Methods
as
follows
:
(i)
performance
according
to
the
number
of
trials
in
the
ECI
calculation
,
(ii)
comparison
of
the
difference
between
correct
and
incorrect
trials
,
and
(iii)
classification
performance
using
EEG
signals
excluding
frontal
or
parietal
electrodes
.



Comparison
with
PCI

We
compared
ECI^(awa)
with
the
PCI
values
computed
following
the
same
procedure
described
in¹⁶
.


PCI
measures
the
complexity
of
the
spatiotemporal
patterns
of
cortical
activity
significantly
evoked
by
TMS¹⁶
.


PCI
ranges
between
0
(minimum
complexity)
and
1
(maximum
complexity)
.


Previous
extensive
validation
of
PCI
provided
an
empirical
cutoff
(PCI*
=
0
.

31)
to
discriminate
between
consciousness
and
unconsciousness¹⁷
.



Statistical
analysis

We
used
the
Kruskal–Wallis
test
(nonparametric
one-way
analysis
of
variance)
to
analyze
the
differences
in
the
classification
accuracy
;
moreover
,
two-sided
multiple
t-tests
were
used
for
post-hoc
analysis
using
Fisher’s
least
significant
differences
method
for
multiple
comparisons
to
compare
the
classification
performance
of
the
three
classifiers
(LDA
,
SVM
,
and
CNN)
of
sleep
data
for
each
component
(arousal
and
awareness)
and
at
three-time
ranges
(0–200
,
200–400
,
400–600
ms)
of
spatiotemporal
information
.


The
Kruskal–Wallis
test
was
also
performed
to
compare
the
classification
performance
using
transfer
learning
.


Similarly
,
Fisher’s
least
significant
differences
method
was
applied
after
the
two-sided
multiple
t-tests
.



To
investigate
the
discrimination
of
ECI
in
each
state
of
consciousness
,
the
feedforward
network
was
trained
with
20
hidden
layers
using
the
LOPO
approach
.


For
each
output
class
,
the
AUC
,
sensitivity
,
and
specificity
were
calculated
using
ROC
analysis
.



The
Kruskal–Wallis
test
was
employed
to
investigate
if
there
were
any
differences
in
relevance
scores
among
brain
regions
from
LRP
under
sleep
.


We
performed
two-sided
multiple
t-tests
using
Fisher’s
least
significant
differences
method
for
multiple
comparisons
.


In
addition
,
the
Kruskal–Wallis
test
was
performed
to
explore
the
differences
in
relevance
scores
from
LRP
under
the
condition
of
anesthesia
and
for
severely
brain-injured
patients
.


For
post-hoc
analysis
,
two-sided
multiple
t-tests
were
performed
using
Fisher’s
least
significant
differences
method
for
multiple
comparisons
.



Finally
,
we
used
Pearson’s
correlation
to
investigate
the
relationship
between
ECI^(awa)
and
PCI
.


In
this
study
,
all
significances
were
indicated
by
\({{{{{\rm{\alpha
}}}}}}\)
=
0
.
