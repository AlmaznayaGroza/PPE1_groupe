   How SB 1580 Defines ‘Right of Medical Conscience’ and Free Speech in
   Health Care
   By Jeff Scott, Esq., FMA General Counsel | July 20, 2023
     __________________________________________________________________

   Should a physician be subject to discipline or job termination for
   refusing to provide a health care service that the physician has a
   sincerely held religious, moral, or ethical objection to?
   During the 2023 session, the Florida Legislature answered this question
   by passing SB 1580. In the first section of this bill, the Legislature
   made its position clear on this issue by stating that

   It is the intent of the Legislature to provide the right of medical
   conscience for health care providers and payors to ensure they can care
   for patients in a manner consistent with their moral, ethical, and
   religious convictions. Further, it is the intent of the Legislature
   that licensed health care providers and payors be free from threat of
   discrimination for providing conscience-based health care.

   This Legislature coupled this “right of medical conscience” with a
   provision protecting the “use of free speech by a health care
   practitioner” to create a comprehensive legislative package that was a
   priority of Gov. Ron DeSantis. This analysis of SB 1580 will attempt to
   explain how these two new provisions affect the practice of medicine.
   Right of Medical Conscience
   SB 1580 creates a new section of the Florida Statutes^1 that gives
   health care providers (and health care payors) the right to “opt out of
   participation in or payment for any health care service on the basis of
   a conscience-based objection.”
   It is important to note that this right of conscience only applies to a
   “health care service.” It does not give a health care provider the
   right to refuse to perform job requirements that do not involve the
   provision of a health care service, or the right to refuse to provide a
   health care service to a particular class of individuals. “Health care
   service” is defined to mean:

   medical research, medical procedures, or medical services, including,
   but not limited to, testing; diagnosis; referral; dispensing or
   administering any drug, medication, or device; psychological therapy or
   counseling; research; therapy; record-making procedures; set up or
   performance of a surgery or procedure; or any other care or services
   performed or provided by any health care provider.

   If a health care provider has a conscience-based objection to
   performing abortions, the provider may not be discriminated against or
   suffer adverse action for refusing to perform abortions. However, a
   provider may not choose to perform abortions for some patients, but not
   for other patients based on the patient’s race, color, religion, sex,
   or national origin.
   The right of conscience is solely attached to a specific health care
   service. A provider can refuse to prescribe contraceptives to his/her
   patients but cannot refuse to prescribe contraceptives to only Medicaid
   recipients. A provider who elects to provide a particular medical
   procedure to his/her patients may not refuse to provide that procedure
   to a subset of patients who engage in a certain type of behavior, even
   if the provider has a conscience-based objection to that behavior.
   While the bill sponsors made it clear as to what the right of
   conscience applies to, they left the issue of whether a conscientious
   objection exists less certain. SB 1580 defines a “conscience-based
   objection” as an objection based on a sincerely held religious, moral,
   or ethical belief.^2 As noted in the footnote, whether an entity such
   as an insurance company has a conscience is determined by existing
   written evidence. If the articles of incorporation for an insurer state
   that the company exists to provide health insurance for individuals
   whose religion forbids the use of birth control, then that insurer will
   be safe from adverse action for selling insurance policies that do not
   provide coverage for birth control (unless of course there is a
   contrary federal requirement). If the company cannot produce a
   governing document, published guideline, or set of policies or
   regulations, it will not be entitled to assert a right of conscience.
   Individual health care providers^3, on the other hand, do not have to
   produce written evidence attesting to a sincerely held religious,
   moral, or ethical belief. Apparently, it will be up to the Florida
   Attorney General, as the entity given enforcement authority for this
   statute, to determine whether a health care provider alleging a
   violation has a valid conscience-based objection. Presumably, the
   Attorney General will assess a provider’s self-professed belief on a
   case-by-case basis in a manner congruent with the inquiry used for
   similar laws, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
   (requiring employers to provide an accommodation for employee’s
   sincerely held religious beliefs).
   Health care providers and payors who wish to opt out of participation
   in or payment for a health care service due to a conscience-based
   objection must do the following:
     * At the time of the objection or as soon as practicable, provide
       written notice of the objection to the provider’s supervisor or
       employer, as applicable.
     * Document the objection to the particular health care service in the
       patient’s medical file.
     * Notify patients seeking an appointment for a health care service
       that the provider has a conscience-based objection to of that
       objection before scheduling the appointment.
     * Providers who are students must provide written notice of their
       conscience-based objection to the educational institution at the
       time the objection is made or as soon as practicable.

   Providers who comply with these requirements may not be discriminated
   against^4 or suffer adverse action^5 for exercising their right of
   medical conscience.
   The right of medical conscience section also includes speech and
   whistle-blower protections, which prohibit discriminating or taking
   adverse action against health care providers or payors who report
   violations of the new right of medical conscience statute. This
   protection is extended to providers who testify, assist or participate
   in a proceeding brought by the Attorney General to determine if a
   violation occurred.
   Interestingly, this part of the new law also includes a prohibition on
   discriminating against a health care provider or payor for reasons not
   related to the right of medical conscience. Protection from
   discrimination is extended to the disclosure of information the
   provider or payor reasonably believes constitutes:
     * A violation of any law, rule, or regulation.
     * A violation of any ethical guidelines for the provision of any
       medical procedure or service; or
     * A practice or method of treatment that may put patient health at
       risk or present substantial and specific danger to public health
       and safety.

   This protection appears to be very broad and could potentially provide
   protection in situations as varied as physicians who complain about
   health insurance prior authorization procedures or physicians who
   notify a hospital of violations of medical staff bylaws.
   Under the original House companion to SB 1580, health care providers
   and payors were given a civil cause of action for any violation of the
   right of conscience section. SB 1580, however, rejected this approach
   in favor of allowing the Attorney General to investigate complaints and
   bring a civil action for damages, injunctive or other appropriate
   relief, and attorney fees.
   Health care providers and payors who decline to participate in or pay
   for a health care service because of a conscience-based objection may
   not be held civilly liable on that basis alone.
   Finally, acknowledging the existence of federal EMTALA requirements,
   the Legislature specifically stated that the medical conscience section
   does not override any state or federal requirement to provide emergency
   medical treatment.
   Use of Free Speech by a Health Care Practitioner
   A bill to ensure the use of free speech by a health care practitioner
   was filed as a stand-alone bill during the 2022 session (HB 687/SB
   1184). Despite support from the Governor, the bills never made it to
   the House or Senate floor. The free speech concept, in a different
   form, was combined with the right of conscience issue in SB 1580,
   passed out of both chambers, and was approved by the Governor less than
   a week after the end of session.
   This scaled down version prohibits a licensing board (or the Department
   of Health if there is no board) from taking disciplinary action against
   a health care practitioner^6 solely because the practitioner has spoken
   or written publicly about a health care service or public policy. This
   includes postings on social media. This protection DOES NOT APPLY to
   speech, written communications, or social media postings that the
   provider uses to provide medical advice or treatment to a specific
   patient. The protection from board discipline also does not apply to
   speech or written communication that separately violates a different
   law or rule.
   Thus, a health care practitioner can basically say anything they like
   about health care or public policy, regardless of whether the assertion
   reflects the actual standard of care or is based on sound scientific
   principles, as long as it is not made to a specific patient as part of
   the medical care of that patient. Unlike the 2022 version, there are no
   provisions that would impose sanctions on a board that violated this
   provision.
   Part of the impetus for this new right of practitioner free speech is
   the alleged actions of the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS)
   in dealing with physicians who advocated for alternative treatments for
   COVID-19 or questioned the safety of COVID vaccines. To correct this
   perceived overreach, the free speech section of SB 1580 includes a
   provision that discourages an approved board-certification recognizing
   agency from revoking the certification of a health care practitioner
   for speaking or writing about a health care service or public policy.
   As with the licensing boards, this protection applies to postings on
   social media but does not apply to speech that constitutes medical
   advice or treatment to a specific patient.
   A specialty board that revokes the certification of a provider solely
   because the provider exercised their free speech rights under this
   section may have their approval revoked by the issuing board. It is
   interesting to note that the specialty boards of the ABMS are
   recognized by statute and not the Board of Medicine^7. As the BOM only
   has the authority to revoke the approval from a recognizing agency that
   it has approved, it appears that the BOM does not have the authority to
   hold an ABMS specialty board accountable for actions taken in violation
   of this section.

   and hospitals) can also have conscience-based objections as determined
   by reference to the entities governing documents; published ethical,
   moral, or religious guidelines or directives; mission statements;
   constitutions; articles of incorporation; bylaws; policies; or
   regulations.
   ^3 Health care provider is defined to mean an entity licensed under
   Florida’s Mental Health Act; nursing homes; licensed medical transport
   services; acupuncturists; MDs; DOs; chiropractors; podiatrists;
   naturopaths; optometrists; nurses; pharmacists; dentists; licensed
   midwifes; speech-language pathologists; audiologists; nursing home
   administrators; occupational therapists; radiological personnel;
   respiratory therapists; dieticians; athletic trainers; orthotists;
   pedorthists; prosthetists;, electrologists; massage therapists;
   clinical laboratory personnel, medical physicists; genetic counselors;
   opticians; hearing aid specialists; physical therapists; psychologists;
   clinical social workers; licensed professional counselors; marriage and
   family therapists; mental health counselors; psychotherapists; any
   activity, service, agency or facility regulated by the Agency for
   Health Care Administration (see s. 408.802 for the full list);
   continuing care facilities; pharmacies; and any student enrolled in an
   educational institution who is seeking to become a health care
   provider.
   ^4 “Discriminated against” is not defined.
   ^5 “Adverse action” is defined as “the discharge, transfer, demotion,
   discipline, suspension, exclusion, revocation of privileges,
   withholding of bonuses, or reduction in salary or benefits; any action
   that may negatively impact the advancement or graduation of a student,
   including, but not limited to, the withholding of scholarship funds; or
   any other disciplinary or retaliatory action taken against a health
   care provider.”
   ^6 “Health care practitioner” is not defined, but since the statute
   created is in Chapter 456, the definition of health care provider in s.
   456.001 would presumably be applicable.
   ^7 Section 458.3312, Florida Statutes (2023).
