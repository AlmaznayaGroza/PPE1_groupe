why did the experience of consciousness evolve from our underlying brain
physiology

 despite being a vibrant area of neuroscience current
research on consciousness is characterised by disagreement and
controversy – with several rival theories in contention



a recent scoping review of over 1000 articles identified over 20
different theoretical accounts

 philosophers like david chalmers argue
that no single scientific theory can truly explain consciousness



we define consciousness as embodied subjective awareness including self
awareness

 in a recent article published in interalia which is not peer
reviewed we argue that one reason for this predicament is the powerful
role played by intuition



we are not alone

 social scientist jacy reese anthis writes “much of the
debate on the fundamental nature of consciousness takes the form of
intuition jousting in which the different parties each report their own
strong intuitions and joust them against each other”



dangers of intuition

key intuitive beliefs – for example that our mental processes are
distinct from our physical bodies mindbody dualism and that our
mental processes give rise to and control our decisions and actions
mental causation – are supported by a lifetime of subjective
experiences



these beliefs are found in all human cultures

 they are important as
they serve as foundational beliefs for most liberal democracies and
criminal justice systems

 they are resistant to counter evidence

 that s
because they are powerfully endorsed by social and cultural concepts
such as free will human rights democracy justice and moral
responsibility

 all these concepts assume that consciousness plays a
central controlling influence



intuition however is an automatic cognitive process that evolved to
provide fast trusted explanations and predictions

 in fact it does so
without the need for us to know how or why we know it

 the outcomes of
intuition therefore shape how we perceive and explain our everyday world
without the need for extensive reflection or formal analytic
explanations



while helpful and indeed crucial for many everyday activities intuitive
beliefs can be wrong

 they can also interfere with scientific literacy



intuitive accounts of consciousness ultimately put us in the driver s
seat as “captain of our own ship”

 we think we know what consciousness
is and what it does from simply experiencing it

 mental thoughts
intentions and desires are seen as determining and controlling our
actions



the widespread acceptance of these tacit intuitive accounts helps
explain in part why the formal study of consciousness was relegated to
the margins of mainstream neuroscience until late 20th century



the problem for scientific models of consciousness remains accommodating
these intuitive accounts within a materialist framework consistent with
the findings of neuroscience

 while there is no current scientific
explanation for how brain tissue generates or maintains subjective
experience the consensus among most neuroscientists is that it is a
product of brain processes



social purpose

if that s the case why did consciousness defined as subjective
awareness evolve



consciousness presumably evolved as part of the evolution of the nervous
system

 according to several theories the key adaptive function
providing an organism with survival and reproductive benefits of
consciousness is to make volitional movement possible

 and volition is
something we ultimately associate with will agency and individuality


it is therefore easy to think that consciousness evolved to benefit us
as individuals



humans are a highly social species

 esteban de armasshuttestock

but we have argued that consciousness may have evolved to facilitate key
social adaptive functions

 rather than helping individuals survive it
evolved to help us broadcast our experienced ideas and feelings into the
wider world

 and this might benefit the survival and wellbeing of the
wider species



the idea fits with new thinking on genetics

 while evolutionary science
traditionally focuses on individual genes there is growing recognition
that natural selection among humans operates at multiple levels

 for
example culture and society influence traits passed on between
generations – we value some more than others



central to our account is the idea that sociality the tendency of
groups and individuals to develop social links and live in communities
is a key survival strategy that influences how the brain and cognition
evolve



adopting this social evolutionary framework we propose that subjective
awareness lacks any independent capacity to causally influence other
psychological processes or actions

 an example would be initiating a
course of action

 the idea that subjective awareness has a social
purpose has been described previously by other reserachers



the claim that subjective awareness is without causal influence
however is not to deny the reality of subjective experience or claim
that the experience is an illusion



while our model removes subjective awareness from the traditional
driving seat of the mind it does not imply that we don t value private
internal experiences

 indeed it is precisely because of the value we
place on these experiences that intuitive accounts remain compelling and
widespread in social and legal organisation systems and psychology



while it is counterintuitive to attribute agency and personal
accountability to a biological assembly of nerve cells it makes sense
that highly valued social constructs such as free will truth honesty
and fairness can be meaningfully attributed to individuals as
accountable people in a social community



think about it

 while we are deeply rooted in our biological nature our
social nature is largely defined by our roles and interactions in
society

 as such the mental architecture of the mind should be strongly
adapted for the exchange and reception of information ideas and
feelings

 consequently while brains as biological organs are incapable
of responsibility and agency legal and social traditions have long held
individuals accountable for their behaviour



key to achieving a more scientific explanation of subjective awareness
requires accepting that biology and culture work collectively to shape
how brains evolve

 subjective awareness comprises only one part of the
brain s much larger mental architecture designed to facilitate species
survival and wellbeing
