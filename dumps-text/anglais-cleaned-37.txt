by “intellectual conscience” nietzsche means the idea that it is wrong
to believe something unless you have good reason to think that the
belief is true

 someone with an intellectual conscience will form and
endorse beliefs by applying the best epistemic standards known to him or
her



most of us nietzsche thinks lack an intellectual conscience

the great majority of people lacks an intellectual conscience

 i
mean the great majority of people does not consider it contemptible to
believe this or that and to live accordingly without first having given
themselves an account of the final and most certain reasons pro and con
and without even troubling themselves about such reasons afterward


the gay science §2



exercising the intellectual conscience if one does possess it doesn t
necessarily lead to certainty on the contrary

 the more you subject
your beliefs to scrutiny the less certain you will become about them


this is good because searching for the truth as well as finding it is
good

 bernard reginster puts the point as follows

the seeker after knowledge must want both knowledge and uncertainty or
ignorance

 he cannot be a genuine seeker after truth unless he actually
wants to find it but since what he cares about is the search after
truth he must also welcome the uncertainty and ignorance that supply
opportunities for it

 the affirmation of life nietzsche on overcoming
nihilism



although intellectual conscience is a necessary condition it is not
nietzsche seems to think a sufficient one

 the “last idealists of
knowledge in whom alone the intellectual conscience dwells today”
namely the scientists have rendered christian belief untenable but
they shrink from questioning their own values

 “these are by no means
free spirits for they still believe in the value of truth

” on the
genealogy of morals iii §24



properly employed by an authentic free spirit intellectual conscience
works against the tendency to assimilate novel experiences or problems
to alreadyfamiliar explanations and evaluations

 by eroding convictions
and multiplying possibilities it counteracts the disposition to
simplify and unify and makes it less likely to get stuck in any one
perspective



the best article i know of on nietzsche s concept of intellectual
conscience is jeremy page s “nietzsche on honesty” 2019



below william holman hunt the awakening conscience 1853

 not a
depiction of intellectual conscience but it s the best i can do
