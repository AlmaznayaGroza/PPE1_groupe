what is freedom of conscience

 

whether they re happening inside the church or out in the public square
debates about how far freedom of conscience extends can be confusing


should christians be compelled to take a vaccine that s been tested on
the fetal remains of an aborted child

 should christian business owners
have a right to refuse a service that would violate their conscience
like baking a wedding cake for a samesex ceremony

 how do christians
respond to government mandates or policies that they cannot follow in
good conscience

 and how do we deal with conscientious disagreement
within the church



the specifics of freedom of conscience can be complex and nuanced and
are often misunderstood

 abraham kuyper called the conscience

“the shield of the human person the root of civil liberties the source
of a nation s happiness

”

why is it so important

 to answer that question let s begin by looking
at what the conscience is and is not



what is “conscience”



definitions of conscience vary but they center around the idea of what
someone believes to be right and wrong

 the conscience is a moral
compass that helps direct people s actions

 in that sense conscience is
personal and subjective because it condemns or excuses one s own
conduct not that of another person – after all you don t get a guilty
conscience because of someone else s behavior



however conscience is also based on an objective and general standard


the bible explains that the conscience is given by god to both
christians and nonchristians and it helps people apply their knowledge
of right and wrong to their behavior both past actions and decisions
about future actions

 the new testament also speaks of the importance of
having a good conscience by following its direction and doing what is
right see rom

 215 1 tim

christian political scientist david koyzis in his book we answer to
another tells a story about the milgram experiment which relates well
to conscience

 the experiment was a study designed to look at how people
respond to authority

 the experimenter would select two participants and
assign one the role of teacher while another volunteer would be given
the role of student

 the person selected as the teacher was instructed
to apply an electrical shock of increasing voltage to the other person –
the student – who was in a different room

 now unbeknownst to the
teacher the other person was actually an actor being paid to play the
part

 although the teacher could hear the apparent pain experienced by
the person in the next room most individuals would continue applying
electric shocks – despite increasing screams and pleas to stop – when
instructed to do so by the experimenter

 however two participants were
unwilling to keep going along with the instructions

 both were
christians

 they followed the experiment instructor s commands for a
time but stopped sooner than most other participants knowing that they
were responsible for their actions and stating that they were answerable
to a higher authority



when asked to do something wrong we too are responsible for our actions
and answerable to a higher authority



ultimately the foundation for freedom of conscience is found in the
sovereignty of god

 every human being has various authorities in their
lives such as parents employers church leadership or civil
government

 each of these has legitimate authority over us but that
authority is also limited

 the only one who is sovereign over the
conscience is god and if another authority commands us to do what we
believe is sin – what we believe violates how god wants us to act – then
we can appeal to freedom of conscience

 the conscience is a shield that
protects against the abuse of authority and points instead to the one
higher authority



conscience and the public square

debates around conscience are becoming increasingly relevant in our
society and are most noticeable within certain vocations

 can medical
professionals refuse to help a patient access abortion assisted
suicide or sexchange surgery

 can marriage officiants refuse to marry
a samesex couple

 can a photographer decline a request to take photos
at a samesex ceremony

 can a publisher decline to print proabortion
pamphlets



increasingly our society answers “no

” to allow people to
conscientiously object is seen as simply discriminatory and bigoted

 our
society needs to understand that a conscientious objection in these
cases is not a rejection of an individual person but a refusal to
commit what the objector believes to be a sin or to participate in
sinful activity



today it s often christians who are being pressured to violate their
conscience

 however there are others who seek the same protections for
their conscience

 it s this freedom that an atheist doctor appeals to
when he determines he cannot participate in euthanasia based on his
oath to do no harm

 and what of the fashion designers back in 2016 who
had principled objections to designing an inauguration dress for first
lady melania trump

 when these designers announced they would not make
the dress because they didn t want to be associated with newly elected
president donald trump s administration many celebrated their decision
as taking a principled stand

 likewise some in our society want
abortionsupporting publishers to be allowed to decline print orders for
prolife material or for a gay business owner to be allowed to refuse
to rent a hall for an event that promotes biblical marriage



yet increasingly the same people want to see christians reprimanded for
acting according to their beliefs



for christians the answer to the questions above might be easy

 but we
have our own disputes about conscience within the church as well such
as what kind of entertainment is permissible or what it looks like to
honor the sabbath day outside of corporate worship



when conscience pricks

of note the strongest commands of conscience are often negative in
terms of what you are not permitted to do rather than what you may or
must do

 for example if you use foul language your conscience will
likely bother you more than if you fail to correct someone else using
such language

 or if a publisher prints proabortion pamphlets that he
objects to his conscience will make him feel guilty more than if he
fails to promote life as he believes he ought



when the conscience commands a person not to do something the command
is about a very specific action

 alternatively if the command is
instead to act on something good there are often various ways of
pursuing that good



conscience and the church

because of sin no person s conscience is perfectly aligned with what
god commands in his word

 the chart below is based on one from a helpful
book titled conscience what it is how to train it and loving those
who differ by andrew naselli and j

d

 crowley

 the authors used it to
explain the difference between two people s consciences and how they
compare to god s will

 the letters within the chart refer to different
rules or principles of right and wrong



both arnold and zoey have added rules to their conscience that are not
commanded in scripture

 for example perhaps arnold has a history of
alcohol abuse in his family so he adds letter c which commands him
not to drink alcohol to avoid temptation

 maybe letters d and e are
arnold s belief that he must not play cards or any games involving dice


arnold and zoey have also both failed to include letter b in their
conscience

 perhaps this is a failure to consistently honor the sabbath
day and their consciences no longer accuse them for it

 however arnold
and zoey s consciences are both aligned with god s will in letters j 
through m where they have rightly applied biblical principles and
commands to their lives and consciences

 the natural tendency is to
think that if another person has more rules than us they are
legalistic

 alternatively if they have fewer rules they are failing to
live as christians

 however scripture remains the standard to which we
must seek to align our conscience





the conscience can easily become oversensitive by including rules that
are not matters of right and wrong

 we see examples of the pharisees in
the new testament who created additional rules for the sabbath and
wanted everyone to abide by them

 we might feel unnecessarily guilty if
we do not abide by similar rules on the sabbath



alternatively conscience can become desensitized

 perhaps you use or
tolerate foul language that would have shocked you a decade ago or you
consume entertainment that you would have been ashamed of years earlier


our conscience does not always accurately tell us what is sin and what
is not

 while it might not always make sense to follow conscience in
relation to other authorities we have a duty to obey it because we
cannot commit what we believe is sin



at the same time we should be careful when dealing with the consciences
of other people

 in 1 corinthians 8 the apostle paul talks about
whether believers can eat meat offered to idols and refers to
consideration for brothers and sisters with a weaker conscience

 so if
we believe a brother or sister has a weaker conscience we must not be a
stumbling block to them and cause them to disobey their conscience

 on
disputable issues we may realize that someone has a weaker conscience
and we can discuss the biblical principles that apply

 or perhaps they
have a stronger conscience and they can help us understand where our
conscience is not aligned to scripture



again conscience is not meant to be some wishywashy idea where
everyone can believe what they want like in the time of the judges of
israel when “everyone did what was right in his own eyes

” there are
direct objective commands and principles that can be taken from
scripture

 there are many issues which should not be disputable for
christians and are clear in the bible



however there are also issues where serious christians can come to
different conclusions about what god commands

 for example what
activities are not permitted on the sabbath

 or perhaps more current
how do we navigate government restrictions and the call to honor our
authorities versus our callings to obey what god demands of us

 what
about masking vaccines etc

 both within the public square and the
church

 christian conscience differs on these issues and believers can
have biblical arguments for why they think god commands or prohibits
different actions



what isn t conscience



some of us might react to the idea that conscience is a kind of
subjective belief that is not accountable to other people

 we can t
simply say “well what s right for you isn t necessarily right for me

”
conscience is not merely a personal preference like your favorite food
or music

 it is also not license to do whatever you please and ignore
other authorities

 rather freedom of conscience refers to moral beliefs
that respect a limited sphere of individual authority while still
recognizing other legitimate authorities that can impose obligations on
us



as such the conscience is not unlimited

 some people might abuse the
ability to claim conscientious objection out of selfinterest or to
simply justify their actions

 authorities such as the civil government
church government employers or parents do have power to compel or deny
certain actions



however if the civil government or other authorities limits
conscience they must provide good justification for doing so and seek
to accommodate conscientious objectors as much as they are able such as
through exemptions for freedom of conscience

 abraham kuyper again shows
the importance of conscience stating that

“ten times better is a state in which a few eccentrics can make
themselves a laughingstock for a time by abusing freedom of conscience
than a state in which these eccentricities are prevented by violating
conscience itself

”

conclusion

ultimately conscience belongs to an individual and is accountable to
god

 however it should also be rooted in biblical commands and
principles

 increasingly we encounter disagreements in the church about
various issues while in the public square some christians jobs are
threatened because the state fails to recognize conscience

 on many
matters christians will refuse to do something they believe is evil
even if others do not believe the action is wrong

 the church has an
opportunity to continue to show our society what it means to live
according to moral standards based on the will and sovereignty of god


wherever we find ourselves let s seek to say “i myself always strive
to have a conscience without offense toward god and men” acts 2416

human rights

should christians be free to obey our conscience



in recent years there s been a worrying downward trend for religious
freedom in both canada and the united states

 examples abound of
christian tshirt printers bakers photographers printshop owners
wedding dress makers florists and caterers who are being forced –
through human rights commissions or through lawsuits – to participate
in samesex weddings in violation of these various business peoples 
consciences

 each of these christian business people said they would
bake cater arrange flowers print invitations take photos print
tshirts etc

 for a gay person s birthday or retirement party or any
other celebration – they just wouldn t do it for a samesex wedding the
only exception was the wedding dress maker for obvious reasons

 this
means the objection is not about discriminating against gay people

 it
never was

 it s very specifically about endorsing a definition of
marriage or a specific act that fundamentally violates god s design for
marriage

 stand up for others i know of christians who can with a clean
conscience bake photograph etc

 a gay wedding

 and i know some who
can t see 1 cor

 8

 this is a legitimate discussion to have between
christians

 the much bigger question is should the state force the
latter group to do as the former

 if you are a christian and you
advocate that the state is justified in making christians participate
in any way in a gay marriage i believe you ve ripped the rug from
under yourself – if it is fine for the state to violate other
christians consciences this time what s to prevent them from violating
yours next

 if a christian photographer has to shoot a gay wedding does
a church have to rent their hall for a gay wedding

 this happened in
british columbia in 2005

 or must an organist play for a gay marriage
ceremony

 or will a christian marriage commissioner be forced to
officiate for such a celebration

 in saskatchewan and manitoba this is
the case

 negative implications of the bill for christians does this
mean that i m ready to let the state allow the same kind of
discrimination against christians

 if an atheist decides he doesn t want
to take photos of a christian wedding am i okay with that

 well
the state can t force all citizens to embrace encourage and support the
christian faith because that wouldn t be freedom of religion would it


freedom of religion is freedom from the state and not from fellow
citizens

 your charter rights protect you from the busybody government
interfering in your religious practices and beliefs

 they are not meant
to make the government interfere in your personal or professional
relationships in order to promote oppose or defend your religion

 so
to be clear and consistent i do expect and accept being shunned by
others because of my christian beliefs

 christ predicted it didn t
he

 i would not expect the state to go to bat for me if a gay bookstore
refused to sell my book on a biblical understanding of gaymarriage or
if an islamic school refused to hire me as a janitor

 if i wanted to
publish a christian defense of capital punishment i wouldn t expect the
state to force a mennonite printer to publish it for me

 with liberty
comes responsibility

 that includes responsibility to go find another
printer or baker or candlestick maker
