Activism which use awareness campaigns

Consciousness raising (also called awareness raising) is a form of
activism popularized by United States feminists in the late 1960s. It
often takes the form of a group of people attempting to focus the
attention of a wider group on some cause or condition. Common issues
include diseases (e.g. breast cancer, AIDS), conflicts (e.g. the Darfur
genocide, global warming), movements (e.g. Greenpeace, PETA, Earth Hour)
and political parties or politicians. Since informing the populace of a
public concern is often regarded as the first step to changing how the
institutions handle it, raising awareness is often the first activity in
which any advocacy group engages.

However, in practice, raising awareness is often combined with other
activities, such as fundraising, membership drives or advocacy, in order
to harness and/or sustain the motivation of new supporters which may be
at its highest just after they have learned and digested the new
information.

The term awareness raising is used in the Yogyakarta Principles against
discriminatory attitudes^([1]) and LGBT stereotypes as well as the
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to combat
stereotypes, prejudices and harmful practices toward people with
disabilities.^([2])

Terminology

[edit]

Until the early-17th century, English speakers used the word
"consciousness" in the sense of "moral knowledge of right or wrong"—a
concept today referred to as "conscience".^([3])

Issues and methods

[edit]

In feminism

[edit]

Consciousness raising groups were formed by New York Radical Women, an
early Women's Liberation group in New York City, and quickly spread
throughout the United States. In November 1967, a group including
Shulamith Firestone, Anne Koedt, Kathie Sarachild (originally Kathie
Amatniek), and Carol Hanisch began meeting in Koedt's apartment.
Meetings often involved "going around the room and talking" about issues
in their own lives. The phrase "consciousness raising" was coined to
describe the process when Kathie Sarachild took up the phrase from Anne
Forer:

  In the Old Left, they used to say that the workers don't know they're
  oppressed, so we have to raise their consciousness. One night at a
  meeting I said, 'Would everybody please give me an example from their
  own life on how they experienced oppression as a woman? I need to hear
  it to raise my own consciousness.' Kathie was sitting behind me and
  the words rang in her mind. From then on she sort of made it an
  institution and called it consciousness-raising.

  — Anne Forer^([4])

On Thanksgiving 1968, Kathie Sarachild presented A Program for Feminist
Consciousness Raising, at the First National Women's Liberation
Conference near Chicago, Illinois, in which she explained the principles
behind consciousness-raising and outlined a program for the process that
the New York groups had developed over the past year. Groups founded by
former members of New York Radical Women—in particular Redstockings,
founded out of the breakup of the NYRW in 1969, and New York Radical
Feminists—promoted consciousness raising and distributed mimeographed
sheets of suggesting topics for consciousness raising group meetings.
New York Radical Feminists organized neighborhood-based c.r. groups in
Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens, involving as many as four hundred women
in c.r. groups at its peak.^([5]) Over the next few years, small-group
consciousness raising spread rapidly in cities and suburbs throughout
the United States. By 1971, the Chicago Women's Liberation Union, which
had already organized several consciousness raising groups in Chicago,
described small consciousness raising groups as "the backbone of the
Women's Liberation Movement".^([6]) Susan Brownmiller, a member of the
West Village^([a]) would later write that small-group consciousness
raising "was the movement's most successful form of female bonding, and
the source of most of its creative thinking. Some of the small groups
stayed together for more than a decade".^([7])

"In 1973, probably the height of CR, 100,000 women in the United States
belonged to CR groups."^([8])

Early mid-century feminists argued that women were isolated from each
other, and as a result many problems in women's lives were misunderstood
as "personal," or as the results of conflicts between the personalities
of individual men and women, rather than systematic forms of oppression.
Raising consciousness meant helping oneself and helping others to become
politically conscious. Consciousness raising groups aimed to get a
better understanding of women's oppression by bringing women together to
discuss and analyze their lives, without interference from the presence
of men.^([9])

While explaining the theory behind consciousness raising in a 1973 talk,
Kathie Sarachild remarked that "From the beginning of
consciousness-raising ... there has been no one method of raising
consciousness. What really counts in consciousness-raising are not
methods, but results. The only 'methods' of consciousness raising are
essentially principles. They are the basic radical political principles
of going to the original sources, both historic and personal, going to
people—women themselves, and going to experience for theory and
strategy".^([10]) However, most consciousness raising groups did follow
a similar pattern for meeting and discussion. Meetings would usually be
held about once a week, with a small group of women, often in the living
room of one of the members. Meetings were women-only, and usually
involved going around the room for each woman to talk about a
predetermined subject—for example, "When you think about having a child,
would you rather have a boy or a girl?"^([citation needed])—speaking
from her own experience, with no formal leader for the discussion and
few rules for directing or limiting discussion. (Some c.r. groups did
implement rules designed to give every woman a chance to speak, to
prevent interruptions, etc.) Speaking from personal experience was used
as a basis for further discussion and analysis based on the first-hand
knowledge that was shared.^([citation needed])

Some feminist advocates of consciousness raising argued that the process
allowed women to analyze the conditions of their own lives, and to
discover ways in which what had seemed like isolated, individual
problems (such as needing an abortion, surviving rape, conflicts between
husbands and wives over housework, etc.) actually reflected common
conditions faced by all women.^([citation needed]) As Sarachild wrote in
1969, "We assume that our feelings are telling us something from which
we can learn... that our feelings mean something worth analyzing... that
our feelings are saying something political, something reflecting fear
that something bad will happen to us or hope, desire, knowledge that
something good will happen to us. ... In our groups, let's share our
feelings and pool them. Let's let ourselves go and see where our
feelings lead us. Our feelings will lead us to ideas and then to
actions".^([11])

Ellen Willis wrote in 1984 that consciousness raising has often been
"misunderstood and disparaged as a form of therapy", but that it was, in
fact, in its time and context, "the primary method of understanding
women's condition" and constituted "the movement's most successful
organizing tool." At the same time, she saw the lack of theory and
emphasis on personal experience as concealing "prior political and
philosophical assumptions".^([12])

However, some in the feminist movement criticised consciousness raising
groups as "trivial" and apolitical.^([13])

Through poetry

[edit]

Historically, poetry has been used as a consciousness-raising tactic by
consciousness-raising groups.^([14]) Activist and writer Audre Lorde was
noted to have been one of many scholars who wrote of poetry as a means
of communication for women of color activist and resistance
groups.^([15]) This focus has also been studied by other feminist
scholars as a new approach to women's literary writing
experience,^([16]) and the usage of critical consciousness through the
creation of art as a liberatory praxis.^([17]) Art as a liberatory
praxis has also been explored through a radical queer lens through a
number of publications and journals such as Sinister Wisdom^([18]) and
Conditions,^([19]) online publications with an emphasis on lesbian
writing.

For LGBT rights

[edit]

In the 1960s, consciousness-raising caught on with gay liberation
activists,^([20]) who formed the first "coming-out groups" which helped
participants come out of the closet among welcoming, tolerant
individuals and share personal stories about coming out. The idea of
coming out as a tool of consciousness-raising had been preceded by even
earlier opinions from German theorists such as Magnus Hirschfeld, Iwan
Bloch and Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, all of whom saw self-disclosure as a
means of self-emancipation, the raising of consciousness among fellow
un-closeted individuals and a means of raising awareness in the wider
society.^([citation needed])

In atheism

[edit]

In The God Delusion, anti-religion activist Richard Dawkins uses the
term "consciousness raising" for several other things, explicitly
describing these as analogous to the feminist case.^([21]) These include
replacing references to children as Catholic, Muslim, etc. with
references to children of the adults who are members of these religions
(which he compares to our using non-sexist terminology) and Darwin as
"raising our consciousness" in biology to the possibility of explaining
complexity naturalistically and, in principle, raising our consciousness
to the possibility of doing such things elsewhere (especially in
physics).^([21]) Earlier in the book, he uses the term (without
explicitly referring to feminism) to refer to making people aware that
leaving their parents' faith is an option.^([21])
