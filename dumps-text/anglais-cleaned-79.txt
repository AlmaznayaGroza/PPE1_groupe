Article
Summary

Philosophers
have
used
the
term
‘consciousness’
for
four
main
topics
:
knowledge
in
general
,
intentionality
,
introspection
(and
the
knowledge
it
specifically
generates
)
and
phenomenal
experience
.


This
entry
discusses
the
last
two
uses
.


Something
within
one’s
mind
is
‘introspectively
conscious’
just
in
case
one
introspects
it
(or
is
poised
to
do
so
)
.


Introspection
is
often
thought
to
deliver
one’s
primary
knowledge
of
one’s
mental
life
.


An
experience
or
other
mental
entity
is
‘phenomenally
conscious’
just
in
case
there
is
‘something
it
is
like’
for
one
to
have
it
.


The
clearest
examples
are
:
perceptual
experiences
,
such
as
tastings
and
seeings
;
bodily-sensational
experiences
,
such
as
those
of
pains
,
tickles
and
itches
;
imaginative
experiences
,
such
as
those
of
one’s
own
actions
or
perceptions
;
and
streams
of
thought
,
as
in
the
experience
of
thinking
‘in
words’
or
‘in
images’
.


Introspection
and
phenomenality
seem
independent
,
or
dissociable
,
although
this
is
controversial
.



Phenomenally
conscious
experiences
have
been
argued
to
be
nonphysical
,
or
at
least
inexplicable
in
the
manner
of
other
physical
entities
.


Several
such
arguments
allege
that
phenomenal
experience
is
‘subjective’
;
that
understanding
some
experiences
requires
undergoing
them
(or
their
components
)
.


The
claim
is
that
any
objective
physical
science
would
leave
an
‘explanatory
gap’
,
failing
to
describe
what
it
is
like
to
have
a
particular
experience
and
failing
to
explain
why
there
are
phenomenal
experiences
at
all
.


From
this
,
some
philosophers
infer
‘dualism’
rather
than
‘physicalism’
about
consciousness
,
concluding
that
some
facts
about
consciousness
are
not
wholly
constituted
by
physical
facts
.


This
dualist
conclusion
threatens
claims
that
phenomenal
consciousness
has
causal
power
,
and
that
it
is
knowable
in
others
and
in
oneself
.



In
reaction
,
surprisingly
much
can
be
said
in
favour
of
‘eliminativism’
about
phenomenal
consciousness
;
the
denial
of
any
realm
of
phenomenal
objects
and
properties
of
experience
.


Most
(but
not
all
)
philosophers
deny
that
there
are
phenomenal
objects
–
mental
images
with
colour
and
shape
,
pain-objects
that
throb
or
burn
,
inner
speech
with
pitch
and
rhythm
,
and
so
on
.


Instead
,
experiences
may
simply
seem
to
involve
such
objects
.


The
central
disagreement
concerns
whether
these
experiences
have
phenomenal
properties
–
‘qualia’
;
particular
aspects
of
what
experiences
are
like
for
their
bearers
.


Some
philosophers
deny
that
there
are
phenomenal
properties
–
especially
if
these
are
thought
to
be
intrinsic
,
completely
and
immediately
introspectible
,
ineffable
,
subjective
or
otherwise
potentially
difficult
to
explain
on
physicalist
theories
.


More
commonly
,
philosophers
acknowledge
qualia
of
experiences
,
either
articulating
less
bold
conceptions
of
qualia
,
or
defending
dualism
about
boldly
conceived
qualia
.



Introspective
consciousness
has
seemed
less
puzzling
than
phenomenal
consciousness
.


Most
thinkers
agree
that
introspection
is
far
from
complete
about
the
mind
and
far
from
infallible
.


Perhaps
the
most
familiar
account
of
introspection
is
that
,
in
addition
to
‘outwardly
perceiving’
non-mental
entities
in
one’s
environment
and
body
,
one
‘inwardly
perceives’
one’s
mental
entities
,
as
when
one
seems
to
see
visual
images
with
one’s
‘mind’s
eye’
.


This
view
faces
several
serious
objections
.


Rival
views
of
introspective
consciousness
fall
into
three
categories
,
according
to
whether
they
treat
introspective
access
(1
)
as
epistemically
looser
or
less
direct
than
inner
perception
,
(2
)
as
tighter
or
more
direct
,
or
(3
)
as
fundamentally
non-epistemic
or
nonrepresentational
.


Theories
in
category
(1
)
explain
introspection
as
always
retrospective
,
or
as
typically
based
on
self-directed
theoretical
inferences
.


Rivals
from
category
(2
)
maintain
that
an
introspectively
conscious
mental
state
reflexively
represents
itself
,
or
treat
introspection
as
involving
no
mechanism
of
access
at
all
.


Category
(3
)
theories
treat
a
mental
state
as
introspectively
conscious
if
it
is
distinctively
available
for
linguistic
or
rational
processing
,
even
if
it
is
not
itself
perceived
or
otherwise
thought
about
.
