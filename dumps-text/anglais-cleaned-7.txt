Good
Monday
morning
,
and
thank
you
for
listening
today
.


We
begin
the
week
with
a
really
sharp
and
robust
question
from
a
listener
named
Arnaldo
.


Here
it
is
:
“Hello
,
Tony
and
Pastor
John
.


Thank
you
for
your
labors
on
this
podcast
!


My
question
is
one
that
I
have
struggled
with
for
over
two
decades
now
.


It’s
this
:
How
can
I
live
with
a
good
conscience
?


The
apostle
Paul
often
talks
about
the
conscience
,
and
how
specifically
a
‘good
conscience’
is
something
he
always
lived
with
,
apparently
even
before
he
became
a
Christian
(Acts
23
:1
;
24
:16)
.


We
also
see
that
a
‘good
conscience’
is
a
qualification
for
Christian
leaders
(1
Timothy
3
:9)
.


And
having
a
‘good
conscience’
is
an
important
goal
of
the
Christian
life
for
all
believers
(1
Timothy
1
:5
,
19)
.



“When
I
read
the
way
Paul
uses
the
word
conscience
in
these
contexts
,
it
seems
like
he’s
saying
it
means
to
be
‘presently
walking
in
obedience
to
everything
God
has
revealed
to
him
.

’
He
does
not
seem
to
mean
that
he’s
trusting
in
Christ’s
blood
to
cover
over
his
indwelling
sin
.


I
believe
in
both
the
doctrine
of
indwelling
sin
and
of
progressive
sanctification
(according
to
texts
like
Proverbs
4
:18
and
Romans
7
:21–23)
.


God
is
always
revealing
to
me
new
areas
,
and
sometimes
old
areas
,
where
I
need
to
grow
in
holiness
.


These
are
very
real
sin
issues
that
I
can’t
simply
stop
doing
,
like
turning
off
a
light
switch
.


These
are
ones
in
which
I
am
engaged
in
a
long-term
,
ongoing
struggle
and
fight
.


So
I
pray
daily
for
forgiveness
(according
to
1
John
1
:8–10
and
Matthew
6
:12)
.



“All
this
means
that
I
literally
never
have
a
good
conscience
—
I
am
always
aware
of
important
ways
in
which
I
presently
need
to
repent
and
become
more
holy
.


So
if
a
good
conscience
is
a
basic
Christian
issue
,
and
Paul
always
had
one
,
yet
I
will
always
know
of
sin
areas
in
my
life
—
and
if
I
have
to
pray
daily
for
forgiveness
—
how
could
I
,
or
any
Christian
for
that
matter
,
ever
attain
to
a
good
conscience
?

”

Well
,
Arnaldo
has
done
his
homework
.


He
laid
out
texts
in
that
question
,
as
I
hear
it
,
that
contain
all
the
pieces
.


I’ve
got
a
few
to
add
that
might
take
a
little
turn
.


Wow
,
he’s
not
winging
it
here
in
asking
that
question
.


If
there’s
a
solution
,
and
I
do
believe
there
is
,
it’s
probably
found
inside
those
texts
that
he
was
just
commenting
on
,
but
maybe
drawing
some
inferences
from
them
that
were
not
necessarily
accurate
.



Sin
That
Dwells
Within

I
feel
the
force
of
the
question
.


Experientially
,
walking
in
a
good
conscience
is
not
easy
for
me
since
I
share
Arnaldo’s
deep
awareness
of
my
ongoing
,
indwelling
sin
.


That’s
Paul’s
term
in
Romans
7
:17
,
20
,
23
.


We
all
have
remaining
corruption
and
indwelling
sin
.


The
more
keenly
you
are
aware
of
that
,
the
more
you
will
feel
embattled
at
the
level
of
needing
a
good
conscience
.




“The
whole
New
Testament
does
assume
that
in
this
life
,
nobody
attains

sinless
perfection
.

”

I
get
it
.


I
mean
,
I
think
that’s
a
serious
question
.


The
whole
New
Testament
does
assume
that
in
this
life
,
nobody
attains
sinless
perfection
.


We
need
to
just
settle
that
.


That’s
one
of
the
premises
.


Nobody
attains
sinless
perfection
in
this
life
.



Jesus
said
that
we
would
pray
,
“Forgive
us
our
debts”
right
after
,
“Give
us
this
day
our
daily
bread”
(Matthew
6
:11–12)
.


They
go
together
.


Every
day
,
say
both
of
those
.


Paul
said
,
“Not
that
I
have
already
attained
[perfection]
,
but
I
press
on
to
make
it
my
own”
(Philippians
3
:12)
.


He
referred
to
the
sin
that
dwells
in
him
and
cried
out
in
dismay
,
“Who
will
deliver
me
from
this
body
of
death
?

”
(Romans
7
:24)
.


Jesus
pointed
to
the
publican
who
said
,
“God
,
be
merciful
to
me
,
a
sinner
!

”
over
against
the
Pharisee
who
was
thanking
God
that
he
had
such
a
clear
conscience
—
and
he
said
that
the
one
who
cried
out
for
mercy
about
his
sin
went
down
to
his
house
justified
(Luke
18
:10–14)
.


It
was
good
for
him
to
own
his
sinfulness
,
not
to
say
,
“Oh
,
it
doesn’t
exist
.


I’ve
got
a
clear
conscience
.


I
don’t
have
any
sin
to
repent
of
.

”
We
feel
the
force
.



Now
,
I
think
1
John
1
is
not
only
especially
illuminating
but
gives
us
a
category
alongside
good
conscience
that
may
provide
the
solution
.



Walking
in
the
Light

Here’s
my
reading
of
1
John
1
,
starting
with
verses
6
and
7
.




If
we
say
we
have
fellowship
with
God
while
we
walk
in
darkness
,
we

lie
and
do
not
practice
the
truth
.


But
if
we
walk
in
the
light
,
as
he

is
in
the
light
,
we
have
fellowship
with
one
another
,
and
the
blood
of

Jesus
his
Son
cleanses
us
from
all
sin
.



Now
,
that
is
staggeringly
amazing
.


“If
we
walk
in
the
light
.


.


.


the
blood
of
Jesus
.


.


.


cleanses
us
.

”
Wow
.


Here’s
1
John
1
:8
:
“If
we
say
we
have
no
sin
,
we
deceive
ourselves
,
and
the
truth
is
not
in
us
.

”
Now
he’s
reeling
it
back
in
and
saying
,
“Don’t
assume
that
when
I
say
,
‘Walk
in
the
light
,’
I
mean
sinlessness
.

”
First
John
1
:9–10
says
,
“If
we
confess
our
sins
,
he
is
faithful
and
just
to
forgive
us
our
sins
and
to
cleanse
us
from
all
unrighteousness
.


If
we
say
we
have
not
sinned
,
we
make
him
a
liar
,
and
his
word
is
not
in
us
.

”

Now
,
what’s
amazing
about
this
passage
is
that
it
says
we
must
be
walking
in
the
light
for
the
blood
of
Jesus
to
cleanse
us
from
our
sins
.


Then
he
says
that
this
walking
in
the
light
doesn’t
mean
sinlessness
.


We
are
liars
if
we
say
it
does
.


Then
he
explains
that
when
we
walk
in
the
light
,
we
see
clearly
enough
—
we
have
light
—
to
know
sin
,
to
see
sin
as
what
it
is
and
hate
it
and
confess
it
.


Then
we
enjoy
ongoing
cleansing
and
forgiveness
.




“A
good
conscience
is
virtually
the
same
as
walking
in
the
light
.

”

Here’s
what
I
would
draw
from
this
if
I
use
the
category
of
conscience
to
explain
this
passage
:
a
good
conscience
is
virtually
the
same
as
walking
in
the
light
.


Christians
should
be
able
to
say
,
“I’m
walking
in
the
light
,”
and
mean
it
,
and
mean
by
that
,
“I’m
walking
in
a
good
conscience
.

”
Which
means
I
don’t
think
we
should
equate
having
a
bad
conscience
with
having
indwelling
sin
.


Now
,
that
may
be
the
most
important
thing
I
say
,
Tony
.


Let
me
say
it
again
.


I’m
inferring
,
from
what
I’ve
said
from
1
John
1
,
that
having
a
bad
conscience
is
not
the
same
as
having
indwelling
sin
.


They’re
not
the
same
.



Our
Clear
Conscience

That’s
my
basic
answer
to
Arnaldo’s
question
.


He
feels
that
as
long
as
he
is
aware
of
the
reality
of
indwelling
sin
,
as
in
Romans
7
,
he
cannot
have
a
good
conscience
.


Now
,
if
that
were
true
,
I
don’t
think
Paul
could
ever
have
a
good
conscience
,
but
he
clearly
says
he
does
have
a
good
conscience
.



“I
thank
God
whom
I
serve
,
as
did
my
ancestors
,
with
a
clear
conscience”
(2
Timothy
1
:3)
.


He
expects
the
elders
of
the
church
to
do
the
same
:
“They
must
hold
the
mystery
of
the
faith
with
a
clear
conscience”
(1
Timothy
3
:9)
.


That’s
the
goal
for
all
Christians
.


According
to
1
Timothy
1
:5
,
“The
aim
of
our
charge
is
love
that
issues
from
a
pure
heart
and
a
good
conscience
and
a
sincere
faith
.

”
I
don’t
think
we
should
equate
a
good
conscience
with
sinless
perfection
in
this
life
,
nor
equate
a
bad
conscience
with
the
presence
of
indwelling
sin
or
remaining
corruption
.


Rather
,
a
clear
or
a
good
conscience
is
like
walking
in
the
light
.




If
we
walk
in
the
light
,
as
he
is
in
the
light
,
we
have
fellowship

with
one
another
,
and
the
blood
of
Jesus
his
Son
cleanses
us
from
all

sin
.


If
we
say
we
have
no
sin
[in
other
words
,
if
we
interpret

“walking
in
the
light”
as
“sinless
perfection”]
,
we
deceive
ourselves
,

and
the
truth
is
not
in
us
.


If
we
confess
our
sins
,
he
is
faithful
and

just
to
forgive
us
our
sins
and
to
cleanse
us
from
all

unrighteousness
.


(1
John
1
:7–9)

David’s
Example

I
think
both
Paul
and
John
inherited
this
concept
of
ongoing
,
indwelling
sin
that
nevertheless
coexists
with
a
good
conscience
from
the
Psalms
in
the
Old
Testament
.



For
example
,
in
Psalm
25
,
David
confesses
three
times
that
he’s
a
sinner
.


“[God]
instructs
sinners
in
the
way”
(verse
8)
;
“Pardon
my
guilt
,
for
it
is
great”
(verse
11)
;
“Forgive
all
my
sins”
(verse
18)
.


The
psalm
comes
to
an
end
in
verse
21
like
this
:
“May
integrity
and
uprightness
preserve
me
,
for
I
wait
for
you
.

”

In
David’s
mind
—
now
,
he’s
writing
under
God’s
inspiration
,
and
this
is
not
the
only
place
in
the
Psalms
;
there
are
a
lot
of
psalms
that
distinguish
the
righteous
and
the
wicked
.


The
righteous
are
really
righteous
:
they’re
walking
in
the
light
;
they
have
a
good
conscience
.


In
David’s
mind
,
there
is
an
integrity
and
an
uprightness
that
is
aware
of
indwelling
corruption
that
breaks
out
at
times
in
sins
.


It
does
.


And
that
ongoing
reality
of
indwelling
sin
does
not
nullify
what
David
calls
his
integrity
and
his
uprightness
.



I
think
Paul
and
John
saw
that
.


They
were
immersed
in
the
Old
Testament
and
used
language
that
way
.


John
used
the
language
of
walking
in
the
light
though
we
are
imperfect
.


Paul
used
the
language
of
walking
in
a
good
conscience
though
we
are
imperfect
.


I
think
for
all
of
them
(David
,
Paul
,
John)
,
the
key
that
enabled
them
to
think
this
way
is
that
they
all
knew
God
had
made
a
way
for
all
their
sins
to
be
passed
over
—
namely
,
the
blood
of
the
Lamb
,
Jesus
Christ
.


David
knew
this
was
coming
,
and
Paul
and
John
knew
it
had
come
.



I
do
think
Arnaldo
is
right
to
say
that
justification
by
faith
is
not
the
same
as
walking
in
a
good
conscience
,
or
walking
in
the
light
,
or
having
integrity
.


Those
are
real
character
traits
,
not
imputed
righteousness
.


Nevertheless
,
it’s
the
covering
of
all
their
sins
by
the
blood
of
Jesus
that
enables
them
to
look
upon
their
conscience
and
walking
and
integrity
with
thankfulness
and
confidence
that
it
really
will
be
accepted
by
God
as
good
,
though
imperfect
.



People
of
Integrity

Here’s
one
last
implication
.


People
might
think
,
“Well
,
how
does
this
matter
?

”
Here’s
a
concrete
illustration
of
how
it
matters
.


Suppose
a
pastor
is
accused
falsely
of
being
unfaithful
to
his
wife
.


The
reason
he’s
accused
is
because
someone
in
the
congregation
hates
him
and
wants
him
to
be
dismissed
.


When
he
comes
before
the
church
or
the
elders
to
state
the
truth
,
with
his
children
present
and
his
wife
looking
on
,
that
is
not
the
time
for
him
to
say
to
the

“Well
,
yes
,
I
am
a
sinner
like
everybody
else
.


I’m
no
better
than
adulterers
.


Everyone
has
indwelling
sin
that
crops
out
from
time
to
time
.


I
shouldn’t
be
put
on
a
pedestal
.


I’m
no
better
than
anyone
else
.

”

No
,
no
,
no
.


That
is
not
the
time
to
say
that
with
your
kids
listening
,
and
your
wife
listening
,
and
the
whole
church
wondering
.


What
you
need
to
say
at
that
moment
is
this
:
“My
conscience
is
clear
.


I
am
a
man
of
integrity
.


I
have
walked
in
the
light
.


I
have
never
touched
that
woman
or
any
woman
sexually
besides
my
wife
.


This
accusation
is
not
true
.

”

I
think
that
is
one
of
the
implications
of
what
Paul
is
saying
when
he
says
to
the
elders
and
to
the
rest
of
us
that
we
should
walk
in
a
good
conscience
—
or
as
John
would
say
,
walk
in
the
light
.

Ask
Pastor
John

Is
Heaven
a
Real
Place
Right
Now
?



Is
heaven
a
physical
place
that
exists
right
now
?


As
Pastor
John
answers
,
he
encourages
us
to
focus
mainly
on
the
relational
,
not
the
spatial
,
aspect
of
heaven
.

Prayer
Dies
Without
Delight

God
is
looking
for
people
who
pray
to
him
in
need
and
in
plenty
,
in
the
wilderness
and
in
paradise
,
in
desperate
dependence
and
in
adoring
delight
.
