good monday morning and thank you for listening today

 we begin the
week with a really sharp and robust question from a listener named
arnaldo

 here it is “hello tony and pastor john

 thank you for your
labors on this podcast

 my question is one that i have struggled with
for over two decades now

 it s this how can i live with a good
conscience

 the apostle paul often talks about the conscience and how
specifically a good conscience is something he always lived with
apparently even before he became a christian acts 231 2416

 we also
see that a good conscience is a qualification for christian leaders 1
timothy 39

 and having a good conscience is an important goal of the
christian life for all believers 1 timothy 15 19



“when i read the way paul uses the word conscience in these contexts it
seems like he s saying it means to be presently walking in obedience to
everything god has revealed to him

 he does not seem to mean that he s
trusting in christ s blood to cover over his indwelling sin

 i believe
in both the doctrine of indwelling sin and of progressive sanctification
according to texts like proverbs 418 and romans 721–23

 god is
always revealing to me new areas and sometimes old areas where i need
to grow in holiness

 these are very real sin issues that i can t simply
stop doing like turning off a light switch

 these are ones in which i
am engaged in a longterm ongoing struggle and fight

 so i pray daily
for forgiveness according to 1 john 18–10 and matthew 612



“all this means that i literally never have a good conscience — i am
always aware of important ways in which i presently need to repent and
become more holy

 so if a good conscience is a basic christian issue
and paul always had one yet i will always know of sin areas in my life
— and if i have to pray daily for forgiveness — how could i or any
christian for that matter ever attain to a good conscience

”

well arnaldo has done his homework

 he laid out texts in that question
as i hear it that contain all the pieces

 i ve got a few to add that
might take a little turn

 wow he s not winging it here in asking that
question

 if there s a solution and i do believe there is it s
probably found inside those texts that he was just commenting on but
maybe drawing some inferences from them that were not necessarily
accurate



sin that dwells within

i feel the force of the question

 experientially walking in a good
conscience is not easy for me since i share arnaldo s deep awareness of
my ongoing indwelling sin

 that s paul s term in romans 717 20 23


we all have remaining corruption and indwelling sin

 the more keenly you
are aware of that the more you will feel embattled at the level of
needing a good conscience



 “the whole new testament does assume that in this life nobody attains
 sinless perfection

”

i get it

 i mean i think that s a serious question

 the whole new
testament does assume that in this life nobody attains sinless
perfection

 we need to just settle that

 that s one of the premises


nobody attains sinless perfection in this life



jesus said that we would pray “forgive us our debts” right after “give
us this day our daily bread” matthew 611–12

 they go together

 every
day say both of those

 paul said “not that i have already attained
perfection but i press on to make it my own” philippians 312

 he
referred to the sin that dwells in him and cried out in dismay “who
will deliver me from this body of death

” romans 724

 jesus pointed
to the publican who said “god be merciful to me a sinner

” over
against the pharisee who was thanking god that he had such a clear
conscience — and he said that the one who cried out for mercy about his
sin went down to his house justified luke 1810–14

 it was good for
him to own his sinfulness not to say “oh it doesn t exist

 i ve got a
clear conscience

 i don t have any sin to repent of

” we feel the force



now i think 1 john 1 is not only especially illuminating but gives us a
category alongside good conscience that may provide the solution



walking in the light

here s my reading of 1 john 1 starting with verses 6 and 7



 if we say we have fellowship with god while we walk in darkness we
 lie and do not practice the truth

 but if we walk in the light as he
 is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of
 jesus his son cleanses us from all sin



now that is staggeringly amazing

 “if we walk in the light 

 

 

 the
blood of jesus 

 

 

 cleanses us

” wow

 here s 1 john 18 “if we say we
have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us

” now he s
reeling it back in and saying “don t assume that when i say walk in
the light i mean sinlessness

” first john 19–10 says “if we confess
our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse
us from all unrighteousness

 if we say we have not sinned we make him a
liar and his word is not in us

”

now what s amazing about this passage is that it says we must be
walking in the light for the blood of jesus to cleanse us from our sins


then he says that this walking in the light doesn t mean sinlessness

 we
are liars if we say it does

 then he explains that when we walk in the
light we see clearly enough — we have light — to know sin to see sin
as what it is and hate it and confess it

 then we enjoy ongoing
cleansing and forgiveness



 “a good conscience is virtually the same as walking in the light

”

here s what i would draw from this if i use the category of conscience
to explain this passage a good conscience is virtually the same as
walking in the light

 christians should be able to say “i m walking in
the light” and mean it and mean by that “i m walking in a good
conscience

” which means i don t think we should equate having a bad
conscience with having indwelling sin

 now that may be the most
important thing i say tony

 let me say it again

 i m inferring from
what i ve said from 1 john 1 that having a bad conscience is not the
same as having indwelling sin

 they re not the same



our clear conscience

that s my basic answer to arnaldo s question

 he feels that as long as
he is aware of the reality of indwelling sin as in romans 7 he cannot
have a good conscience

 now if that were true i don t think paul could
ever have a good conscience but he clearly says he does have a good
conscience



“i thank god whom i serve as did my ancestors with a clear conscience”
2 timothy 13

 he expects the elders of the church to do the same
“they must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience” 1
timothy 39

 that s the goal for all christians

 according to 1 timothy
15 “the aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a
good conscience and a sincere faith

” i don t think we should equate a
good conscience with sinless perfection in this life nor equate a bad
conscience with the presence of indwelling sin or remaining corruption


rather a clear or a good conscience is like walking in the light



 if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship
 with one another and the blood of jesus his son cleanses us from all
 sin

 if we say we have no sin in other words if we interpret
 “walking in the light” as “sinless perfection” we deceive ourselves
 and the truth is not in us

 if we confess our sins he is faithful and
 just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all
 unrighteousness

 1 john 17–9

david s example

i think both paul and john inherited this concept of ongoing indwelling
sin that nevertheless coexists with a good conscience from the psalms in
the old testament



for example in psalm 25 david confesses three times that he s a
sinner

 “god instructs sinners in the way” verse 8 “pardon my
guilt for it is great” verse 11 “forgive all my sins” verse 18


the psalm comes to an end in verse 21 like this “may integrity and
uprightness preserve me for i wait for you

”

in david s mind — now he s writing under god s inspiration and this is
not the only place in the psalms there are a lot of psalms that
distinguish the righteous and the wicked

 the righteous are really
righteous they re walking in the light they have a good conscience

 in
david s mind there is an integrity and an uprightness that is aware of
indwelling corruption that breaks out at times in sins

 it does

 and
that ongoing reality of indwelling sin does not nullify what david calls
his integrity and his uprightness



i think paul and john saw that

 they were immersed in the old testament
and used language that way

 john used the language of walking in the
light though we are imperfect

 paul used the language of walking in a
good conscience though we are imperfect

 i think for all of them david
paul john the key that enabled them to think this way is that they
all knew god had made a way for all their sins to be passed over —
namely the blood of the lamb jesus christ

 david knew this was coming
and paul and john knew it had come



i do think arnaldo is right to say that justification by faith is not
the same as walking in a good conscience or walking in the light or
having integrity

 those are real character traits not imputed
righteousness

 nevertheless it s the covering of all their sins by the
blood of jesus that enables them to look upon their conscience and
walking and integrity with thankfulness and confidence that it really
will be accepted by god as good though imperfect



people of integrity

here s one last implication

 people might think “well how does this
matter

” here s a concrete illustration of how it matters

 suppose a
pastor is accused falsely of being unfaithful to his wife

 the reason
he s accused is because someone in the congregation hates him and wants
him to be dismissed

 when he comes before the church or the elders to
state the truth with his children present and his wife looking on that
is not the time for him to say to the church “well yes i am a sinner
like everybody else

 i m no better than adulterers

 everyone has
indwelling sin that crops out from time to time

 i shouldn t be put on a
pedestal

 i m no better than anyone else

”

no no no

 that is not the time to say that with your kids listening
and your wife listening and the whole church wondering

 what you need
to say at that moment is this “my conscience is clear

 i am a man of
integrity

 i have walked in the light

 i have never touched that woman
or any woman sexually besides my wife

 this accusation is not true

”

i think that is one of the implications of what paul is saying when he
says to the elders and to the rest of us that we should walk in a good
conscience — or as john would say walk in the light
