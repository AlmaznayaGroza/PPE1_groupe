 breaking down the differences

close 

how does the conscious differ from the conscience

 being conscious is
the state of being awake and alert

 conscience on the other hand
refers to an awareness of whether actions are right or wrong



these two terms are sometimes confused in common everyday usage because
they sound quite similar

 however as you can see they mean very
different things within the field of psychology



at a glance

while the two terms are often confused the conscious and the conscience
refer to very different things

 your conscious allows you to be aware of
your place in the world while your conscience allows you to behave in
this world in morally and socially acceptable ways

 as described below
being conscious refers to your awareness of yourself and the world
around you

 your conscience is your ability to distinguish between what
is right and what is wrong



 what does conscience mean

 

your conscience is the part of your personality that helps you determine
right and wrong and keeps you from acting upon your most basic urges and
desires



your conscience is what makes you feel guilty when you do something bad
and good when you do something kind



it is the moral basis that helps guide prosocial behavior or behavior
that helps others and leads you to behave in socially acceptable and
even altruistic ways



in freudian theory the conscience is part of the superego that contains
information about what is viewed as bad or negative by your parents and
by society—all the values you learned and absorbed during your
upbringing

 the conscience emerges over time as you take in information
about what is considered right and wrong by your caregivers your peers
and the culture in which you live



one way a child s sense of morality might develop is through their
caregiver s rules

 for example if a parent sets a rule a child could
learn a sense of right and wrong regarding that topic

 studies have also
examined other factors that may affect the way conscience develops
including the nature of the parentchild relationship style of parental
discipline and the child s temperament—but more research is needed



 what does conscious mean

 

your conscious is your awareness of yourself and the world around you


in the most general terms it means being awake and aware

 some experts
suggest that you are considered conscious of something if you are able
to put it into words



not only can you be conscious—as in awake—but you can also be
conscious—as in aware—of your thoughts and feelings



 the conscious mind 

in psychology the conscious mind includes everything inside your
awareness including

 fantasies
 feelings
 memories
 perceptions
 thoughts

a metaphor that is sometimes used to explain the concept of the
conscious mind within psychoanalytic theory is likening the mind to an
iceberg

 the part of the iceberg that can be seen above the surface of
the water represents conscious awareness

 it is what we are aware of and
can describe and articulate clearly



the largest part of the iceberg actually lies below the surface of the
water

 this represents the unconscious mind and includes all the
thoughts memories and urges that are outside of our conscious
awareness

 this metaphor is frequently attributed to sigmund freud but
according to the american psychological association apa he never
wrote about it



 what is consciousness

 

your consciousness refers to your conscious experiences your individual
awareness of your own internal thoughts feelings memories and
sensations



consciousness is often thought of as a stream constantly shifting
according to the ebb and flow of your thoughts and experiences of the
world around you



consciousness is generally defined as awareness of your thoughts
actions feelings sensations perceptions and other mental processes
explain psychologists douglass a

 bernstein louis a

 penner and edward
roy



in other words they say this suggests that consciousness isn t just
one mental process but rather a part of many

 for example memories can
be conscious but consciousness is not just memory

 perceptions can be
conscious but consciousness is not just perception



the conscious and consciousness can be difficult to pin down

 as
psychologist and philosopher william james once explained its meaning
we know so long as no one asks us to define it



consciousness in psychology

 breaking down the differences 

conscience

 noun

 moral awareness

 acts as a moral compass

conscious

 adjective

 mental awareness

 means a person is awake and responsive

to further explain their differences here are examples of how the terms
conscience and conscious could be used in a sentence



 conscience 

they had a guilty conscience because they cheated on the test



the term conscience here describes this person s sense of what is right
and wrong and the subsequent feeling of guilt they have over cheating on
the test



 conscious 

they were worried they might faint at the sight of the blood but they
remained conscious



the person was afraid they would lose consciousness by fainting when
they saw blood

 however they didn t faint and stayed awake and aware of
their surroundings



they were conscious of the fact that everyone was staring at them



the term conscious here describes the awareness of the person who
noticed that everyone was looking at them



tip

when thinking about these two concepts just remember that conscious
means to be awake and aware while conscience refers to your inner sense
of right and wrong



 common uses 

 guilty conscience indicates that someone feels guilty about their
 actions
 clear conscience suggests that people 
 conscious of your words suggests that you are aware of the effect
 your words may have and thus choose them with caution


 costconscious indicates that a person is concerned about prices
 and makes choices to conserve money and stay within a budget
 the patient was conscious indicates that a person was awake and
 aware

it s definitely easy to confuse the terms conscious and conscience
particularly when you hear the words spoken out loud

 however with the
help of some context clues and some attention to their spelling
differences you should have no problem telling them apart when you come
across them
