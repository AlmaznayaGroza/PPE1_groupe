medieval theories of conscience

first published tue jan 19 2021

the question of what role the human mind plays in moral behaviour—or the
study of moral psychology—has been a fruitful area of research in
medieval philosophy since at least the early to mid1990s

 since then
scholars have done much to illuminate medieval contributions to such
perennial topics as the freedom of the will the problem of moral
weakness and what role if any the emotions and the moral virtues play
in the achievement of happiness e

 similarly
metaethical theories about the foundations of morality that were
prominent during the medieval period such as natural law
theory—particularly in its thomistic and scotistic variants—continue to
receive robust scholarly attention e

 comparatively less
consideration however has been devoted to what was believed to link
the psychological to the metaethical the mental habit or act of
conscience and its sisterconcept of synderesis though interest in
the subject has recently seen a modest resurgence e

what is the scope and nature of this apparent ability to intuitively
grasp right from wrong

 can conscience err and if so do its dictates
still bind

 the best way to address these and other questions is to
employ a developmental approach

 the term conscience is still generally
used to refer to an innate moral sense but it has slightly different
connotations today than it did in the medieval period which in turn had
different connotations from what preceded it in pagan antiquity and in
scripture

 still medieval theories of conscience drew extensively on
these earlier sources

 since the concepts of conscience and synderesis
evolved over time then it will be necessary to take a linear approach
to the topic and begin with some background

 background the pagan and earlychristian context

1

1 the ancient context judicial conscience

to understand the medieval theory of conscience it is essential to
examine its etymology

 unlike most philosophical categories that are
central to medieval thought the concept of conscience did not have its
origins in plato or aristotle potts 1982 687

 rather most scholars
agree it originated in the greek playwrights of the fifth century bce
sorabji 2014 12 15–18

 it is also possible to find its use elsewhere
in greek literature such as in the fragments of democritus d arcy
1961 5



the english word “conscience” is derived from the latin conscientia

 its
greek equivalent is syneidesis

 both terms connote a state or act of
“sharing knowledge with oneself” sorabji 2014 12

 this knowledge is
privileged and involves awareness of a personal moral defect

 the notion
that “i” can judge “myself” naturally suggests as sorabji puts it a
sort of “split personality”

 that is it suggests that i can at once be
both the judge and the one being judged particularly with respect to
specific past actions which ordinarily elicit remorse

 this suggestion
is rooted in the quite intuitive idea that human beings are reflexive
animals beings who are not only capable of turning their attention to
objects in the outside world but can also “turn back on” reflectere or
become an object to themselves

 as c

 s

 lewis put it in his study of
the concept of concept of conscience in the western tradition

 man might be defined as a reflexive animal

 a person cannot help
 thinking and speaking of himself as and even feeling himself to be
 for certain purposes two people one of whom can act upon and
 observe the other

 thus he pities loves admires hates despises
 rebukes comforts examines masters or is mastered by “himself” 
 he is privy to his own acts is his own conscius or accomplice

 and of
 course this shadowy inner accomplice has all the same properties as
 an external one he too is a witness against you a potential
 blackmailer one who inflicts shame and fear

 lewis 1960 187 see
 also sorabji 2014 12

lewis refers to this primarily pagan understanding of conscience as an
“inner witness”

 it does not judge our actions as right or wrong but
merely testifies to their existence

 it bears witness to the facts say that we committed a murder

 it
 does not tell us that murder is wrong we are supposed to know that in
 some other way

 lewis 1960 190

others however regard the sort of conscience that lewis describes here
as a type of internal judge and therefore refer to it as “judicial
conscience” d arcy 1961 8

 while this property of the mind does not
necessarily issue binding rules it does pass moral judgements on our
deeds

 it would however eventually take on the role of issuing moral
dictates for future acts as well

 eric d arcy refers to this later form
of syneidesis or conscientia as the “legislative conscience” whose
innovator he argues was the apostle paul ca

 5 ce–ca

 6467 ce the
most important founder of the christian faith after jesus of nazareth
d arcy 1961 8

2 st

 paul legislative conscience

the judicial understanding of conscience continued well into the first
century of the common era

 to be sure paul himself continued to employ
it

 at the same time d arcy credited paul with introducing in addition
to the “judicial conscience” a novel conception he termed the
“legislative conscience”

 it is not difficult to see why the earlier
judicial conception would later take on legislative features

 this is
because the ability to judge past actions as either right or wrong—and
to issue exhortations on that basis—would once this property came to be
associated with the moral law take on the legislative role of issuing
commands

 indeed it is in st

 paul that we find this very association
between syneidesis and the moral law

 when gentiles who do not have the law do by nature things required
 by the law they are a law for themselves even though they do not
 have the law

 they show that the requirements of the law are written
 on their hearts their consciences also bearing witness and their
 thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending
 them

 romans 214–15 niv

judging by this passage there are evidently two expressions of the
moral law according to paul the mosaic law explicitly handed down to
the jews and another law that is “written on men s hearts”

 this
latter was later glossed as a reference to the natural law which is
accessible to all people nonjews included and is consistent with the
mosaic law

 notice that according to the foregoing passage conscience
syneidesis is not the ultimate source of right and wrong

 rather the
foundation of right and wrong is the objective moral law which is both
“written on men s hearts” and borne witness to by conscience



one might say then that the objective norm of morality on paul s
account is the moral law or natural law

 conscience however might be
termed morality s subjective norm

 this is made clear in another passage
from st

 paul where he is addressing the question of whether it is
permissible for christians to eat meat that was previously sacrificed to
idols

 some paul says erroneously think that to eat such food defiles
them

 in fact since the pagan idols do not exist eating food
sacrificed to them or indeed to god himself is morally irrelevant
since “food does not bring us near to god—we are no worse if we do not
eat and no better if we do” 1 corinthians 88 niv

 still even
though the consciences of such christians are erroneous they must
follow them since conscience paul suggests is a rule of conduct
romans 1413–23

 eric d arcy sums up these two important contributions
of st

 paul as follows

 st

 paul then introduces an entirely new phase in the history of the
 term “conscience” in moral theory and two new features characterize
 his use of it

 first it is to play a directive role before action
 takes place

 in the pagan writers conscience did not appear on the
 scene until after the action was performed and its role was purely
 judicial but in st

 paul conscience is credited with a legislative
 function and it induces an obligation in the proper sense

 second
 conscience is fallible the directions it issues may be mistaken but
 whether it be mistaken or not it seems that we are bound to follow
 its rulings

 d arcy 1961 11–12

in sum we might follow sorabji s suggestion that this phase in the
development of the concept of conscience—that is from its origins in
fifthcentury bce greek literature to the firstcentury ce—has eight
features sorabji 2014 36



1

 it involves a consciousness of the self rather than of others


2

 it draws on values to which one feels personally committed or that
 are “not necessarily shared by others”


3

 it is selfreflexive insofar as it suggests a “split person” an “i”
 that has secret knowledge which it shares with itself


4

 its original purpose was “retrospective” or judicial although it
 later incorporated into its definition a “prospective” or
 legislative function


5

 although it draws on general moral principles it is chiefly
 concerned with their application to the specific circumstances in
 which the agent finds him or herself


6

 it began as a secular concept


7

 in the christian tradition it is regarded as susceptible to error
 and
8

 although cognitive in character it possesses motivating or
 affective power

3 st

 jerome the invention of synderesis

that conscience was so central a concept in st

 paul s writings
guaranteed it an important place in the moral theology of the greek and
latin fathers especially st

 basil john damascene and st

 ambrose


amongst these early writers however it was a text from st

 jerome that
was particularly consequential since it introduced into the debate a
neologism that would have an important impact in the later middle ages
the concept of synderesis



in the course of commenting on ezekiel jerome had tied a prophecy
mentioned in its first book to plato s moral psychology commentary on
ezekiel 1

7

 the prophecy in question consisted of a vision of four
creatures emerging from the heavens each with four faces those of a
man a lion an ox and an eagle ezekiel 1 4–14

 in his gloss jerome
noted that “most people” plerique interpreted this vision with
reference to plato s tripartite division of the soul in the republic
the human face representing reason the lion s face the spirited part
and the ox s face the appetitive part cf

 plato republic 436b–441b


what did the eagle represent

 according to jerome it represented that
“spark of conscience” scintilla conscientiae which makes us aware of
our sinfulness when reason spirit or desire become disordered

 medieval
manuscripts refer to this psychological property as synderesis or
sometimes synteresis

 now above these three was the eagle so in the soul they say above
 the other three elements and beyond them is a fourth which the greeks
 call synderesis

 this is that spark of conscience which was not
 quenched even in the heart of cain when he was driven out of
 paradise

 this it is that which makes us too feel our sinfulness
 when we are overcome by evil desire or unbridled spirit or deceived
 by sham reason

 it is natural to identify synderesis with the eagle
 since it is distinct from the other three elements and corrects them
 when they err however we also see that this conscience
 conscientia is cast down in some people who have neither shame nor
 insight regarding their offences and loses its place 

 commentary
 on ezekiel 1

7 d arcy trans

 1961 16–17

most scholars now agree that the neologism “synderesis” introduced in
jerome s commentary is simply a corruption of the greek syneidesis
kries 2002 67

 since syneidesis is simply the greek equivalent of the
latin term conscientia—a fact of which jerome would certainly have been
aware—one might have expected jerome to use them interchangeably


surprisingly however jerome suggests that the latin term means
something different from the greek term

 in the text cited above he
quite explicitly states that regardless of how morally corrupt its
possessor becomes synderesis can never be lost

 a few lines later
however he does admit the existence of those who are shameless and
lacking in moral insight

 such people are oblivious to their offenses
because according to jerome their conscience conscientia ceases to
be present in them “looses its place”

 if synderesis cannot be lost
but conscience can then it seems to follow that they are separate
properties of the soul

 in any case whatever jerome s intention this
curious passage was indirectly handed down to the middle ages via the
sentences of peter lombard 1095–1160

 the earlyscholastic tradition

2

1 peter lombard the scholastic origins of the debate

peter lombard s role in the evolution of the concept of conscience is
both surprising and unsurprising

 it is—at first sight
anyway—surprising because lombard does not discuss conscience or
synderesis in any actual detail

 indeed he does not strictly speaking
mention the terms “synderesis” or “conscience” at all

 what he does is
merely to allude to jerome s commentary on ezekiel in the context of
discussing the will s role in how rational agents can naturally want
what is good while simultaneously being slaves to sin peter lombard
sententiae in iv libros distinctae 2

39 potts 1980 92

 in st

 paul s
reference to moral weakness in romans 715 he famously says “for i do
not do what i want but do what i do not want”

 is paul suggesting asks
lombard that we have two separate wills one naturally oriented towards
the good and another oriented towards sin

 or is it rather the case that
we have a single will that although naturally inclined to the good
contains a defect which also “takes pleasure in what is evil”
sententiae in iv libros distinctae 2

39 potts 1980 93

 amongst
those who hold the first view the motivating power that orients us
towards the good is called the “natural” will while the inclination
towards sin resulting from the fall is called “free will” or “free
choice”

 with respect to the former peter writes

 for some say that there are two motivations one by which a man
 naturally wants what is good

 why naturally

 and why is it called
 “natural”

 because such was the motivation of human nature in its
 original state in which we were created without any defect and this
 is properly called “nature”

 for man was created with a righteous will
 man is therefore rightly said naturally to want what is good
 because he was constructed with a good and righteous will

 for the
 higher spark of reason superior enim scintilla rationis which as
 jerome says “could not even be extinguished in cain” always wants
 what is good and hates what is bad

 peter lombard sententiae in iv
 libros distinctae 2

39 potts trans

 1980 92–93

lombard s brief mention of jerome s “spark of reason” sic in the
aforementioned passage is the full extent of his treatment of conscience
and synderesis

 still that was sufficient to ensure that it would
receive robust attention by later scholastics who would track down the
original text from jerome in order to comment on it

 a compilation of
theological writings taken mainly from scripture and the fathers and
arranged in systematic fashion the sentences had an enormous impact on
later theological enquiry since much it after the 1220s was carried
out within the taxonomy that lombard had laid out in his work

 indeed
after alexander of hales 1185–1245 adopted the sentences as the main
source for his ordinary lectures at paris in 1222 and richard fischacre
1206–1248 did the same at oxford in 1245 lecturing on the sentences
became a requirement for every aspiring master of theology

 thus did
such major scholastics of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries as
bonaventure 1221–1274 thomas aquinas 122425–1274 john duns scotus
1265–1308 and william of ockham 1287–1347 come to write their
important commentaries on the work

 this tradition would continue well
into the sixteenth century



consisting of four books each subdivided into chapters the sentences
follows the distinction that saint augustine had drawn in the de
doctrina christiana between the things that are real and the signs that
lead us back to the former

 book one treats of god who is really real
and his triune nature

 book two deals with creation and the fall
including human nature treating these as signs that point back to god


book three treats of christ who is the antidote to the fall and who
as god incarnate is both thing and sign

 finally book four treats of
the sacraments which are signs that assist the fallen in their return
to god the ultimate reality

 since book two deals with human moral
psychology in the context of creation and the fall it is here in
distinction 39 that peter lombard s mention of jerome s commentary on
ezekiel is found



since lombard s treatment of jerome was partial and elliptical later
thinkers in composing their commentaries on the sentences naturally
turned to jerome s text in order to scrutinize the original passage


there they discovered his apparent distinction between synderesis and
conscience which in turn would come to frame the parameters of the
later medieval debate

 if synderesis and conscience are in fact two
separate parts of the soul for instance what is their relationship to
one another

 what come to that are their respective natures and
rather importantly can they become disordered

 such questions would
preoccupy the theologians of the later middle ages



2

2 stephen langton synderesis and its properties

stephen langton 1155–1228 regent master of theology at paris and
later archbishop of canterbury is important in the present context less
for any systematic treatment of conscience—indeed stephen scarcely
touches on the issue at all—than for his somewhat scattered views on
synderesis

 the relevant treatment comes in stephen s quaestiones
disputatae of 1203–1205 in the context of his discussion on free
decision liberum arbitrium



for stephen there are three powers vires of the soul that are
relevant to the moral life the concupiscible appetite reason and
synderesis

 the concupiscible appetite draws reason towards what is
bad—specifically towards the sin of sensuality—while synderesis attempts
to sway it towards the good

 it is reason s job to adjudicate between
these two impulses

 freedom of decision libertas arbitrii is the
outcome of reason directing the will to choose in accordance with either
the promptings of sensuality or the promptings of synderesis stephen
langton quaestiones disputatae lottin ed

 psychologie et morale i
1942 61



the purpose of synderesis then is to direct reason away from vice for
it is the faculty “by which a person naturally detests what is evil and
is a part of the rational power” quaestiones disputatae lottin ed


psychology et morale ii

1 1948 112

 can such a power be extinguished


yes and no

 in its capacity as an inclination towards the good which is
accidental to it synderesis can indeed be lost in the damned


essentially speaking however the purpose of synderesis is to repudiate
what is wicked

 in this sense it is never lost even in the damned
quaestiones disputatae lottin ed

 1948 111



stephen langton s most important contribution to the development of the
concept of synderesis occurs in his discussion of whether synderesis can
merit or demerit

 in the process of discussing this issue stephen links
synderesis to the practical syllogism specifically associating it with
the grasp of general principles quaestiones disputatae lottin ed


1948 113

 d arcy sums up langton s position as follows

 remorse of conscience is the work not of synderesis but of reason
 for synderesis remains at the level of general principles whereas
 reason descends to the concrete case but it is precisely over the
 concrete case that remorse of conscience is felt hence it is by
 reason and not by synderesis that we sin

 d arcy 1961 23–24

langton s association of synderesis with general moral principles would
as we will see influence later thinkers such as aquinas



2

3 philip the chancellor the first systematic treatment of synderesis and conscience

although stephen langton was the first scholastic to touch on the issue
of synderesis in any depth it was philip the chancellor ca

 1170–1237
who wrote the first treatise devoted to exploring the relationship
between synderesis and conscience lottin 1948 139–157

 as chancellor
of notre dame philip had the right to grant the license to teach in the
theology faculty at paris and it was under his tenure that the
dominicans and the franciscans acquired their chairs in theology two
for the former and one for the latter

 although primarily an
administrator philip was also a trained theologian

 his most important
work is the summa de bono which includes the treatise on conscience



in his treatise philip sets out to answer several questions related to
the ontological status of synderesis to the question of whether anyone
can sin if they follow synderesis and to whether it can ever be
extinguished

 as to the ontological status of synderesis philip cites
jerome s authoritative suggestion that synderesis is a faculty or power
of the soul

 recall that jerome had posited a quadripartite soul one
that is composed of reason spirit desire and synderesis

 since the
first three parts of the soul are potentialities and synderesis is
classified alongside these it seems to follow that it too must be a
faculty or power of the soul distinct from the faculty of reason


philip cites st

 paul and john of damascus as corroborating authorities
who apparently share the view that synderesis is a faculty of the soul
independent of the others philip the chancellor summa de bono
treatise on conscience potts trans

 1980 95–96



against the claim that synderesis is a power of the soul philip
presents arguments for the view that it is on the contrary a moral
habit

 on this view synderesis is to the natural will what choice is to
the deliberative will a disposition that regulates the rationally
appetitive powers

 but while choice simply regulates the deliberative
will with respect to the contingent good or means towards happiness
synderesis

 is a disposition arising naturally in conjunction with that
 potentiality by which the natural will is directed to what is good
 without qualification

 summa de bono treatise on conscience potts
 trans

 1980 96

moreover just as the impulse to sin is distinct from the soul so too
is synderesis

 but whereas the former inclines the agent towards evil
the latter inclines him towards goodness



is synderesis then a power of the soul or a habit

 this distinction
goes back to aristotle for whom powers are innate and associated with
specific capacities while habits are acquired and associated by
contrast with tendencies to behave in certain ways

 habits moreover
inhere in powers

 although both of these properties dispose the agent to
act in particular ways powers in contrast to habits are linked to the
ability to do so contingently

 if i am in the habit of speaking russian
for instance then i will have the tendency to do so on a regular basis


it is my preferred mode of communication and i will take every
opportunity to express myself in that language

 that i may have the mere
capacity—or power—to speak russian on the other hand having studied it
in school say in no way ensures that i will do so even in situations
where i probably should

 i might for example hate and resent speaking
russian for various reasons and therefore freely refuse to do so under
any circumstances see e

g

 aristotle metaphysics 9

2 and potts
1980 20–22



although philip seems to favour the belief that synderesis is a habit
the claim that it is a power of the soul has the rather weighty
authority of st

 paul and st

 jerome

 philip therefore splits the
difference as it were and argues that it is a “habitlike power” or
“dispositional potentiality” habitualis potentiae—a faculty of the
soul that disposes its possessor towards choosing the unqualified
good—though one that is innate rather than acquired through habituation

 synderesis although the morphology of its name makes it sound more
 like a disposition than a potentiality is nevertheless the name of a
 dispositional potentiality i do not say of an acquired disposition
 but of an innate one

 and thus qua disposition it can be applied to
 what is related to it as a disposition qua potentiality to what is
 related to it as a potentiality

 from this it follows that it has a
 certain opposition to free choice a certain opposition to the impulse
 to sin and sensuality and a certain opposition to proheresis which
 is part of free choice qua potentiality it is disparate from free
 choice and from sensuality qua disposition it is disparate from
 proheresis and the impulse to sinso if anyone asks whether it is a
 potentiality or a disposition the right answer lies in taking
 something in between a dispositional potentiality

 summa de bono
 treatise on conscience potts trans

 1980 97

it would seem then that synderesis is a potentiality albeit an
unusual one

 is it connected to the cognitive side of the soul or to the
appetitive

 according to philip it is related to the appetitive and
specifically to the rational appetite that is to the will rather than
to the sense appetite

 however as we saw philip divides the rational
appetite into what he calls “natural will” and “deliberative will”

 the
natural will signifies the general inclination that humans have to the
good or happiness as such

 such an object is beyond the scope of choice


having said that happiness can be achieved in any number of ways and by
the acquisition of any number of legitimate though contingent goods


indeed it is fair to say that rational agents never choose happiness as
such given that it is a mere abstraction

 rather what they choose are
particular goods which taken together comprise the good life if
pursued in an orderly way

 such contingent goods are the means to
happiness and are the objects of the deliberative will and therefore
choice

 synderesis according to philip pertains to the natural will


it is the remnant of original rectitude or justice which although
damaged during the fall remains in the soul in diminished form

 as
philip puts it synderesis is that which “murmurs back against sin and
correctly contemplates and wants what is good without qualification”
summa de bono treatise on conscience potts trans

 1980 100



on the matter of conscience and how it is related to synderesis philip
distinguishes them

 for one thing conscience can be mistaken while
synderesis cannot

 specifically conscience is the result of a
concurrence of synderesis with free decision liberum arbitrium

 put
otherwise it is the specific application of a general moral principle
that is the outcome of deliberation

 when correctly applied conscience
is correct

 when incorrectly applied it errs

 in either case the
judgement of conscience generates a moral obligation to act

 philip uses
the following example of how synderesis which is always right can
nonetheless conjoin with an erring conscience potts 1980 104

1

 unerring universal premise of synderesis “everyone who falsely
 claims to be the son of god should be put to death”


2

 erring minor premise of reason “this christ fellow is falsely
 claiming to be the son of god”


3

 erring judgement of conscience “therefore this christ fellow should
 be put to death”

from the foregoing example it is clear that synderesis delivers a
general nondeliberative proposition while conscience yields what
potts calls a particular “deontic proposition”

 philip s argument is that we need to distinguish between general
 and particular propositions which are of the form “a ought to φ”
 where the proper name of any person may be substituted for “a” and any
 verbphrase containing a verb of action for “φ” i shall henceforth
 call these “deontic propositions”

 potts 1982 690–692

in the example given above then the first universal premise is
correct by definition while the conclusion as mediated by erring
reason generates an incorrect deontic proposition which is to say an
obligation to act albeit a mistaken one

 the laterscholastic tradition

1 st

 bonaventure conscience as cognitivesynderesis as affective

one of the most prominent representatives of the franciscan intellectual
tradition bonaventure 1217–1274 lectured on the sentences at paris
from 1250 until 1252 when he became regent master in the theology
faculty a position he held until 1257

 his commentary on the sentences
is the fruit of these lectures and it is in this work that he discusses
the topics of conscience and synderesis

 for bonaventure we not only
possess innate moral knowledge but we also have an inextinguishable
inclination towards achieving the good

 our inborn knowledge of the
former that is of the natural law is associated with conscience
which resides in the intellect while our inclination towards desiring
the good is associated with synderesis which inheres in the will



what is the ontological status of conscience

 according to bonaventure
just as theologians have disagreed over the nature of “thought”
defining it variously as the power of thinking a habit or an
apprehended principle of knowledge so too have they differed over how
to define “conscience” conscientia

 most commonly however the term
has been used to refer to a cognitive habit or disposition that relates
to the practical as opposed to the theoretical intellect

 indeed it is
the disposition that perfects the practical intellect

 how so

 through
its consciousness of the principles that comprise the natural law—such
as that “god is to be honoured”—and through the issuing of such
injunctions to the will

 as bonaventure puts it

 theoretical knowledge perfects our thought to the extent that the
 latter is theoretical whereas conscience is a disposition perfecting
 our thought to the extent that it is practical or to the extent that
 it directs us towards deeds

bonaventure s solution is to find a middle position between st

 paul on
the one hand and aristotle on the other

 his conclusion conscience is
part innate part acquired



in what sense is it innate

 just as rational creatures have a natural
capacity to judge the veracity of first principles in the realm of
speculative reason so we have an innate capacity to judge the first
principles of practical reason

 this innate capacity to immediately
grasp such principles as true or not in the realm of practical reason is
called conscience

 it is associated for bonaventure with the
augustinian “natural light”—or “natural tribunal”—that is built into the
structure of the mind and which permits rational agents to intuitively
grasp the basic principles of the natural law see e

g

 augustine
city of god 11

27 bettenson trans

 1972 461–462

 just as the mind is
disposed to grasp in the realm of theoretical reason the axiomatic
nature of such propositions as that “all bachelors are unmarried males”
so too it has a innate disposition to grasp as selfevidently true such
basic principles in the domain of practical reason as “honour thy father
and mother” and “do not harm thy neighbour”



in what sense though is conscience acquired

 although the ability to
judge the deontic propositions of the natural law as selfevidently true
is innate it does not follow that the contents of such propositions are
innate

 it does not follow that is that the concepts “father” and
“mother” in the precept to honor one s parents are in the mind from
birth

 and indeed so bonaventure thinks they are not

 rather they are
species or likenesses acquired through sense experience which once
acquired form the terms of the universal propositions of the natural
law that are intuitively grasped

 in this sense bonaventure is true to
aristotle

 for everyone agrees that there is an imparted light of the
 apprehensory potentiality which is called a natural tribunal but we
 acquire forms and likenesses of things by means of the senses as
 aristotle says explicitly in many places and as experience also
 teaches us

conscience then is partly innate and partly acquired with respect to
the content of the natural law

 but what is the relationship of such
universal premises to the conclusions of practical reason

 how does the
agent proceed from a general knowledge of right and wrong to the
application of this knowledge to concrete situations

 after all such
universal premises are only useful to the extent that they can be
applied

 for bonaventure the habit of directing the agent toward
applying the general principles of the natural law to specific actions
like the habit of immediately grasping deontic principles is innate


but in order to apply this selfevident knowledge we must acquire
further knowledge

 for example although we grasp a priori the truth
that one should honor one s father and mother we have no innate
knowledge that john and mary are our parents and that it is they
specifically who must be honoured as opposed to say michael and jane


rather this type of knowledge is derived from experience and
instruction



note that conscience does not simply move from the general to the
particular with respect to concrete actions

 it also moves from the
general to the specific with respect to propositions themselves

 as
potts points out there are in fact two classes of deontic propositions
basic and derived potts 1982 698

 consider the deontic proposition to
obey god which is basic or maximally evident

 obviously other more
specific precepts can be derived from this very general one


historically for instance from the basic deontic proposition to obey
god the jews derived the further less evident but more specific deontic
propositions to refrain from eating pork and to circumcise their sons


how did they come to know these more specific propositions

 by means of
a revealed commandment—via divine instruction in other words

 although the distinction between basic and derived deontic
propositions is potts and although the case cited is an example of an
erroneous conscience bonaventure argues that male circumcision and the
prohibition on eating pork are no longer applicable it accurately sums
up bonaventure s distinction between propositions that are “very clearly
evident” versus those that are “less evident”

 just as some things that are cognizable are very clearly evident such
 as axioms and first principles while some are less evident such as
 particular conclusions so also in things that can be done some are
 evident in the highest degree for example “do not do to another what
 you do not want done to you” and that one should submit to god and
 suchlike

 in the same way then as the cognition of first principles
 is said to be innate in us by reason of that light because due to
 their selfevidence that light suffices for cognizing them after the
 reception of species without any additional persuasion so also the
 cognition of moral first principles is innate in us in that that
 judicatory suffices for cognizing them

 again in the same way as
 cognition of the particular conclusions of the sciences is acquired
 because the light innate in us does not fully suffice for knowing
 them but some persuasion and fuller acquaintance are needed so on
 the side of things that can be done we must understand similarly
 that we are bound to do some things which we know only through
 additional instruction

 mcgrade trans 2001 179

this distinction between basic or very general principles and specific
or derived precepts is germane to the question of whether conscience can
ever be mistaken and if so whether in such cases it continues to bind


bonaventure s response is that we can never be mistaken about basic
deontic propositions

 rather it is with respect to derived ones that we
sometimes err since

 although conscience is always right so long as it sticks to the
 general and is moved by simple inspection it can become mistaken when
 it descends to particulars and brings things together because the
 actualisation of deliberative reason is mixed with it

conscience is fallible

 if
erroneous—if what it dictates is contrary to the divine will—as is
sometimes the case when applying basic deontological principles then
conscience does not bind

 rather the agent has an obligation to correct
the error in order to bring his conscience into line with the natural
law

 2001 186

 he breaks with tradition however in arguing that it
inheres in the will rather than in the intellect

 indeed synderesis for
bonaventure is precisely the counterpart of conscience insofar as the
will like the intellect has an innate inclination towards the moral
as opposed to the useful good

 in the case of the intellect this
disposition takes the form of the “natural light” of conscience that
apprehends the first principles of the natural law in the case of the
will it takes the form of synderesis a “natural bias” towards desiring
the moral good

 there is one sense however in which synderesis is not
exactly analogous to conscience

 while it looks very much like a habit
synderesis is rather according to bonaventure presumably following

 in such cases
synderesis ceases to “murmur” against evil or “goad” towards the good
either because the agent is blinded by ignorance distracted by physical
pleasure or is so stubbornly persistent in their depravity that they
cannot reorient themselves towards the good

 still when synderesis
follows the innate judgement of conscience with respect to basic deontic
principles which can never err then it too functions correctly because
that is its natural state

 it has the potential to go wrong and fall
into sin only during the exercise of deliberation with respect to
particular truths since it is here that reason can become faulty and the
will which is free disordered

2 st thomas aquinas synderesis and conscience as cognitive

thomas aquinas 122425–1274 is by any measure one of the most
important if not the most important scholastic theologian of the later
middle ages

 although his views on conscience and synderesis have
received less attention in recent years than his theory of natural law
this is unjustified

 for the scholastics a full account of morality
includes not only an explanation of how practical norms are grounded
but also an understanding of how they are grasped and how it is that
rational agents despite possessing an infallible guide to such
knowledge often fail to apply it

 one s metaethics in other words is
inextricably linked to one s moral psychology which is to say to one s
understanding of how the will and the intellect interact with one s
knowledge of right and wrong



aquinas discussed the issues of synderesis and conscience in several of
his major works from his early commentary on the sentences and the de
veritate to his mature summa theologica see d arcy 1961 36–47

 as
might be expected his account is very different from that of his
franciscan contemporary bonaventure

 for one thing bonaventure assigns
synderesis to the will

 he also describes it as we saw above as a
“habitlike faculty”

 aquinas as might be expected hews much closer to
his dominican mentor and teacher albert the great ca

 1200–1280 for
whom both synderesis and conscience belong to the intellect see
dougherty 2018 221



for aquinas the rational part of the soul comprises the faculties or
powers of intellect and will

 the object of the will is the good and
the object of the intellect is the true

 the latter potency is further
divided into the speculative intellect intellectus speculativus and
the practical intellect intellectus practicus

 how do these differ


the object of the speculative intellect is truth as such while the
object of the practical intellect is the good “under the aspect of
truth” thomas aquinas summa theologica i q

 79 a

 11 ad

synderesis and conscience for aquinas both belong to the practical
intellect



all reasoning must start from immediately evident principles if an
infinite regress is to be avoided

 this is as true in the realm of
practical reason as it is in the realm of speculative reason

 once such
principles have been grasped and assented to more specific conclusions
can be deduced

 how are these principles grasped

 in the domain of
speculative reason they are apprehended by the innate disposition that
aquinas calls intellectus—“intuitive reason” or “understanding”—and that
aristotle called nous

 the objects of this habit are such selfevident
propositions as that “every whole is greater than its part” and that
“things equal to one and the same are equal to one another” summa
theologica iii q 94 a

 2 corp



 once their terms are known the
intellect immediately grasps the truth of such propositions since they
are analytic in nature

 the corresponding habit in the domain of
practical reason on the other hand is synderesis a property of the
soul which can never be lost which never errs and whose objects are
the first principles of the natural law de veritate 16

1 corp



 a
good description of how aquinas understands synderesis is hoffmann s
who calls it an “infallible moral awareness” hoffmann 2012 255

 like
understanding synderesis is innate

 wherefore the first practical principles bestowed on us by nature do
 not belong to a special power but to a special natural habit which
 we call “synderesis”

 whence “synderesis” is said to incite to good
 and to murmur at evil inasmuch as through first principles we proceed
 to discover and judge of what we have discovered

 it is therefore
 clear that “synderesis” is not a power but a natural habit

 summa
 theologica i q

 79 a

 12 corp



in broad terms synderesis is a link between the human intellect and the
divine wisdom

 the universe is created and governed by a providential
god and is therefore subject to the order of final causality


accordingly all things rational and nonrational alike seek their
proper ends

 nonrational beings since they lack will and intellect and
are therefore incapable of prudential reasoning achieve their ends
through the natural inclinations that are implanted in them by god

 in
this sense they participate in the providential plan for all creation
that aquinas calls the “eternal law” the divine wisdom insofar as it
directs all creatures towards their ends summa theologica iii q

 93
a

 1 corp



 they do so however in a diminished way

 rational beings
by contrast participate in divine providence in a more excellent way


this participation in the eternal law is called the natural law whose
moral principles function to direct human beings toward their ultimate
end happiness summa theologica iii q

 91 a

 2 corp



 these moral
principles which are grasped and accordingly possessed by synderesis
offer an insight into god s intentions for human beings and therefore
into the ultimate purpose of human life

 as baylor writes of aquinas s
theory

 moral principles are based upon and derived from a rationality that is
 present in reality they are a human knowledge of the exemplary ideas
 in the divine mind according to which creation is imbued with a
 rational order

 baylor 1977 46

practical reasoning then plays a central role in the achievement of
happiness the final end for humans and therefore in god s plan for us


like speculative reasoning practical reasoning generally takes a
deductive form

 just as science is the conclusion of the demonstrative
syllogism so conscience is the conclusion of a practical syllogism

 the
practical syllogism like the demonstrative syllogism contains a major
premise a minor premise and a conclusion

 the major premise is drawn or
deduced from synderesis

 the minor premise on the other hand is drawn
either from faith natural reason or human positive law

 from the major
and minor premises a conclusion is drawn that generates a moral
obligation to act hoffmann 2012 258

 this inferential judgment is
associated for aquinas with conscience an act—as opposed to a faculty
or a habit—that includes a number of applications such as “to witness
to bind or incite and also to accuse torment or rebuke” thomas
aquinas summa theologica i q

 79 a

 13 corp





conscience acts as a “witness” when it is consciously aware of some
personal wrongdoing whether of commission or omission

 it “binds” or
“incites” when it makes a judgement that some act should be performed


finally it “accuses” “torments” or “rebukes” when it judges that some
past action was either morally acceptable or it was not

 although it is
difficult to see how conscience in the first sense—conscience as
witness—can function as an application of knowledge to conduct this
seems less problematic in the second and third senses of the term which
harken back to the legislative and judicial senses of conscience found
in st

 paul and pagan antiquity respectively d arcy 1961 46

 in any
case an example of the way in which conscience applies the natural
law—whose principles are apprehended by synderesis— is articulated in
aquinas s de veritate

 if the judgement of synderesis expresses the statement “nothing
 prohibited by the law of god is to be done” and if the knowledge of
 higher reason presents this minor premise “sexual intercourse with
 this woman is forbidden by the law of god” the application of
 conscience will be made by concluding “this sexual intercourse is to
 be avoided”

 de veritate q

 17 a

 2 corp

 cited in dougherty
 2018 222

now the dictates of conscience can either be right if correctly deduced
from the natural law or wrong if they are incorrectly deduced

 the
dictates of the former are the product of a “correct conscience” and the
judgements of the latter are the result of an “erroneous conscience”


since synderesis is infallible the main source of an erroneous
conscience when it does occur is the agent s adoption of a faulty
minor premise in the practical syllogism de veritate q

 17 a

 2 potts
trans

 1980 132–133



now it is clear that we have an obligation to follow a correct
conscience since to do so contributes to achieving our final end

 but
what of an erroneous conscience

 does this have any authority

 for
aquinas an erring conscience also binds

 it does not however
necessarily excuse

 as hoffmann puts it

 regardless of whether my action is objectively good evil or
 indifferent conscience binds for it is by means of conscience that
 an action is proposed to me as good bad or indifferent

 hoffmann
 2012 260

for example it is objectively right—in accordance with the natural
law—to refrain from sex outside of marriage

 but suppose that an agent
mistakenly believes that such abstinence is sinful and yet still
refrains

 according to aquinas this agent although he does what is
objectively right nonetheless sins

 why

 because in choosing the
opposite of what his conscience dictated he chose to do something he
believed to be evil

 and choosing what is subjectively if not
objectively wrong for aquinas is a sin “f from the very fact that
a thing is proposed by the reason as being evil the will by tending
thereto becomes evil” summa theologica iii q

 19 a

 5 corp





what follows from this is that conscience whether right or erroneous
always binds

 as to the question of whether an erroneous conscience
excuses on the other hand that depends on the type of ignorance that
causes it

 this is because some types of ignorance render an act
involuntary and therefore excusable and some do not

 ignorance that
excuses is called invincible and concerns ignorance about the facts of
the situation assuming of course there is no negligence involved


such cases that is where an agent could not have known better under
the circumstances and would not have thus acted had he known better are
excusable

 aquinas uses the example of fornication—voluntary illicit
sex—to illustrate his point

 although it is a sin to commit adultery a
man is excused if he has sexual relations with a woman who is not his
wife so long as he is genuinely if improbably mistakes the women for
his wife

 this is

 because this error arises from ignorance of a circumstance which
 ignorance excuses and causes the act to be involuntary

 summa
 theologica iii q

 19 a

 6 corp



ignorance that contributes to an erroneous conscience that is in any way
voluntary is vincible or able to be corrected and therefore culpable
if followed

 this generally happens where the agent s ignorance of the
particulars of the situation is either the result of negligence or
where there is ignorance of the relevant moral principles

 the former
cases are the result of the agent not taking appropriate care to find
out about the facts of situation so that he or she can sin while
feigning ignorance

 in the case of one s ignorance of universal
premises this too is culpable since it is one s obligation to know the
moral law

 summa theologica iii q

 19 a

 6 corp





but one might be wondering how it is that culpable ignorance is even
possible where it relates to general moral principles

 how can one go
wrong about the universal premises that form the major premise of the
practical syllogism which are drawn from the precepts which comprise
the natural law if synderesis which grasps such premises is
infallible

 aquinas s answer is that there are two types of natural law
precepts primary—or those which are “most general”—and secondary


aquinas is less specific on this topic than is optimal but in drawing
this distinction he seems to mean something like the following

 about
the primary precepts of the natural law noone can go wrong


unfortunately as we have seen such precepts are of a very general
character such as “do good and avoid evil”

 for such general knowledge
to be applicable by conscience it must be further specified

 this
further specification comprises the secondary precepts of the natural
law which are closely drawn from the former precepts and from natural
inclination

 about such secondary derived precepts of the natural law
such as “adultery is to be avoided” humans are all too prone to become
ignorant

 for aquinas such ignorance is the result either of vice or of
having been socialized in a culture with “vicious customs”

 i answer that there belongs to the natural law first certain
 most general precepts that are known to all and secondly certain
 secondary and more detailed precepts which are as it were
 conclusions following closely from first principles

 as to those
 general principles the natural law in the abstract can nowise be
 blotted out from men s hearts

 but as to the secondary
 precepts the natural law can be blotted out from the human heart
 either by evil persuasions just as in speculative matters errors
 occur in respect of necessary conclusions or by vicious customs and
 corrupt habits 

 summa theologica iii q

 94 a

 6 corp



a final problem seems to emerge are we not according to aquinas s
account of the erroneous conscience left with the possibility of a
moral dilemma

 for if we have an obligation to always follow our
consciences but we sometimes sin when we do follow them then it seems
that we are sometimes put into a double bind

 we seem that is to
sometimes have conflicting obligations so that regardless of what we do
we sin

 aquinas s solution is that it is only wrong to follow a
conscience that is in a state of vincible ignorance

 since such
ignorance is by definition correctable we can always resolve the
apparent dilemma by choosing to put aside our ignorance

 as far as
acting from invincible ignorance is concerned we are pardoned

3 william of ockham new directions in the understanding of synderesis and conscience

with the fourteenthcentury theologian william of ockham 1285–1347 we
encounter some radically new developments on the topics of synderesis
and conscience

 while ockham s franciscan predecessor john duns scotus
had disagreements with aquinas about the nature of the moral law scotus
fundamentally agreed with the dominican in viewing synderesis and
conscience a habit and an act of the practical reason respectively
whose jobs were to apprehend the basic principles of morality in the
case of synderesis and to apply them in the case of conscience john
duns scotus ordinatio 2 d

 39 wolter trans

 1997 162–163

 like
scotus ockham also agrees with aquinas in several crucial respects


where ockham departs from aquinas and indeed with the entire scholastic
tradition which preceded him however is in his abandonment of the
concept of synderesis and in his unique approach to the invincibly
erroneous conscience



it is difficult to know for certain why ockham abandoned the concept of
synderesis

 michael baylor however has suggested two possibilities


the first is that as we have seen synderesis was regarded by ockham s
predecessors like aquinas as an inborn habit

 but for ockham rational
agents only come to possess habits by acquiring them and they can only
acquire them by doing the relevant acts repeatedly

 the notion that a
habit could be innate then would have seemed incoherent to ockham
baylor 1977 78 fuchs 1952 5–6



the second possible explanation—though baylor thinks this
implausible—has to do with the way that ockham understands the
foundations of morality as compared with aquinas

 for ockham there is
no essential connection between the moral order as it currently exists
and the divine wisdom

 the highest norm of morality is the divine will


it just so happens that murder for example is wrong today

 but there
is no reason that god could not make murder right tomorrow if he so
willed

 the moral order in short is contingent

 on the thomistic view
however the natural law is a participation in the eternal law

 it is
the point of contact between god s plan for us as conceived in the
divine mind on the one hand and the human intellect on the other


synderesis as we saw above plays a key role in this connection insofar
as it grasps the moral principles that lead human beings to their final
destiny

 moreover the moral principles that guide us in how to achieve
our final end are as true today as they were yesterday and indeed will
be for all time owing to the natures that god has bestowed upon us

 as
baylor writes

 as the element of man s original nature which was substantially
 undamaged after adam s fall the synteresis was the anthropological
 point of connection between an abiding moral order which manifested
 ideas in the divine intellect according to which creation was
 necessarily ordered and man s certain knowledge of universal
 principles of that moral order

 ockham however stressed the absolute
 contingency of creation for ockham god s will as manifested in
 the moral precepts he has ordained constitutes the ultimate and
 objective norm of morality

 god is under no obligation rather it is
 divine will which determines moral obligation

 this awesome conception
 of divine liberty and omnipotence and the contingency of the created
 order has led many to the conclusion that the objective basis of
 ockham s ethics is authoritarian or positivistic and inherently
 unstable since it appears to depend only upon an alterable divine
 fiat

 if this were so then it would appear odd also to posit within
 man an inborn and inalienable knowledge of moral principles in the
 form of synteresis

 baylor 1977 79–80

a distinguished proponent of the interpretation baylor describes was
servais pinckaers

 because the foundations of morality are rooted in the
divine will which can change there was no need for ockham to resort to
a mechanism that discovers the eternal principles of morality as these
emerge from human nature since for ockham no such principles exist


rather according to pinckaers interpretation of ockham moral
principles are known through revelation

 pinckaers 1993 258

 while
pinckaers was correct in his assessment of ockham s metaethics—which is
fundamentally authoritarian despite elements of rationalism—he was wrong
in his characterization of ockham s moral epistemology

 this is because
while it is indeed possible to come to know the principles of morality
via divine revelation on ockham s account it is also possible despite
their grounding in god s will to come to know them via natural reason
and experience see eardley 2013 82–87

 examples of the former that
is of principles that are selfevidently true are “every blameworthy
evil is to be avoided” and “the will ought to conform itself to right
reason”

 an example of a moral proposition that is grounded in
experience on the other hand is “an angry man should be calmed with
soothing words” eardley 2013 86–87

 god obviously wills that we
should follow such injunctions

 but how can we know his will if not
through revelation

 although the contemporary philosopher peter geach
was not a particularly sympathetic reader of ockham he was willing to
concede the possibility that a metaethics grounded in divine commands
could nonetheless yield a naturalistic moral epistemology

 as he put it

 the rational recognition that a practice is generally undesirable and
 that it is best for people on the whole not even to think of resorting
 to it is thus in fact a promulgation to a man of the divine law
 forbidding the practice even if he does not realise that this is a
 promulgation of the divine law even if he does not believe there is a
 god

 geach 1981 170

ockham would have agreed



a second and related way in which pinckaers misinterpreted ockham s
moral epistemology was pinckaers assumption that because ockham
discarded the traditional notion of synderesis he must have done the
same for its twin concept of conscience

 pinckaers conceded that moral
principles even if rooted in the divine will still need to be applied
to particular situations on ockham s account

 this role was of course
reserved for conscience in the earlier tradition

 in ockham according
to pinckaers this role now became associated with practical reason and
prudence pinckaers 1993 259



a closer reading of the textual evidence suggests that ockham very much
made use of the traditional concept of conscience

 indeed much of how
he employed the concept was consistent with the tradition especially as
articulated by aquinas

 ockham associates the dictates of practical
reason for example with judgements of conscience

 he is also emphatic
in his belief that rational agents have an absolute obligation to follow
their consciences which can be correct or erroneous quaestiones
variae q

 8 a

 1 oth 8 411

 a conscience is correct when it is in
accord with right reason it is erroneous when it is not

 finally an
erroneous conscience for ockham as with aquinas is either in a state
of vincible—voluntary and therefore culpable—ignorance or in a state of
invincible—or involuntary—ignorance

 where conscience is in a state of
vincible ignorance we must do our best to set it aside

 in all these
cases ockham follows the tradition with one exception that of the
invincibly erroneous conscience eardley 2013 94–98 the state in
which the agent finds himself with the correct universal principles but
nonculpably errs with respect to his grasp of the circumstances in
which he finds himself



in what sense does ockham depart from the tradition

 for ockham the act
of following an invincibly erroneous conscience is not merely excusable
as it was for aquinas but “virtuous and meritorious”

 consider the
following example from ockham

 while walking down the street one day you
pass a homeless person who asks you for money

 he appears to have a
moral claim on you since you assent to the moral principle that “help is
to be given to every needy person in extreme need lest he die”

 does he
appear needy and indeed desperate to you

 yes

 sizing him up you
determine that although it is theoretically possible that he could be
fraud this seems unlikely

 for ockham you are obliged in this instance
to follow your conscience and indeed you do

 it turns out however
that this apparent homeless person is in fact a very wealthy person who
is impersonating a beggar

 for ockham in following your conscience you
are not merely excused or absolved of your error but your ignorant
act is virtuous and indeed regarded by god as meritorious so long
that is that your act of charity is done out of love for god

 as
ockham puts it

 consequently in the above case a right act of the will and an error
 of the intellect remain at the same time with respect to the same
 object

 and the whole reason is because that error is not in the power
 of the one who is mistaken who took all due diligence to find out the
 truth and therefore that error excuses from every sin

 and
 consequently the will that elicits the act in conformity to such
 invincibly erroneous reason acts virtuously and meritoriously


 indeed had he not while in such error willed to help that person
 he would have performed a vicious and demeritorious act because such
 an act would have been knowingly elicited against conscience and
 against nonculpable reason because in the aforementioned case he
 does not know that he is in error but believes that he possesses right
 reason and consequently by despising reason in this way he sins
 mortally

 quaestiones varie q

 8 a

 2 oth 8 423–424

what is motivating ockham s novel suggestion

 even aquinas admitted that
we have an obligation to follow our consciences whether right or
erroneous

 when we do not do so according to aquinas we sin

 of
course when our consciences are in a state of voluntary or vincible
ignorance we also have a duty to put aside our error otherwise we sin


it is obviously not possible however to put error aside in the case of
invincible ignorance since such ignorance is by definition involuntary


accordingly for aquinas we are obliged to follow such a conscience


although we act wrongly in such cases we are for aquinas excused on
the grounds that we could not have known better

 to return to aquinas s
example of inadvertently sleeping with someone who is not your spouse
this might be excusable for aquinas but there is no possibility that
such an act might be considered virtuous much less meritorious

 but for
ockham if it is vicious and therefore punishable not to follow an
invincibly erroneous conscience then merely being excused for following
it when we are under a moral obligation to do so would be an
insufficient reward

 rather it should logically follow that it is
virtuous and therefore meritorious
