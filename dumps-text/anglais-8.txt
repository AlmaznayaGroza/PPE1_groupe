Nietzsche on Bad Conscience

   5 June 2020
   Nietzsche
   A portrait of Friedrich Nietzsche, drawn in 1905 by Edvard Munch.

   Friedrich Nietzsche (5 October 1844 – 25 August 1900) was mostly known
   for his philosophy. From reading Nietzsche’s philosophy, though, one
   can sense a breadth of interests: language, history, poetry, culture.
   Yet something consistent connects them: at great lengths he explores
   the psychology of existence. In particular, he was interested in our
   relationship with suffering.
   We have a need to find suffering meaningful, Nietzsche thought,
   creating purpose in a continuous process of interpretation and
   reinterpretation. Thus spoke Nietzsche (hehe) in On the Genealogy of
   Morality, we tend to live under creditor-debtor relationships. There
   are higher creditors (God, society, etc.) and we, the debtors, favour
   the ‘foretaste’ of their higher status.
   In these relationships we feel existential guilt (e.g. from ‘sins’,
   using goods and services, etc.) and embrace—even enjoy—the suffering
   (e.g. through punishment, discipline, tradition, sacrifice, sexual
   deprivation … ).
   However, this psychological instinct has a way of turning itself
   inward: ‘the internalizing of man … what he later calls his soul.’
   Nietzsche was not a fan: such ‘maltreatment’ belongs to ‘desperate
   prisoners’ filled with ‘longing’ and without bodily instinct!
   'I take bad conscience to be the deep sickness into which man had to
   fall under the pressure of the most fundamental of all changes he ever
   experienced—the change of finding himself enclosed once and for all
   within the sway of society and peace. Just as water animals must have
   fared when they were forced either to become land animals or to perish,
   so fared these half animals who were happily adapted to wilderness,
   war, roaming about, adventure—all at once all their instincts were
   devalued and "disconnected".'

   In Nietzsche’s nihilism there are no absolute values; we inherit values
   from social institutions who enforce adherence for their own power. But
   when these values stop servicing our lives we should learn, as
   individuals, to renounce those collective values and create new ones
   which service us once more.
   Nietzsche’s worldview continues to resonate with many people,
   especially the angsty. Go ahead and see: type ‘#nihilism’ into a social
   media platform’s search bar and see what comes up.
   However, there is no doubt that Nietzsche constructed a life-affirming
   philosophy which sought to elicit individual spirit.
