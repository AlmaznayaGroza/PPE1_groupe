ethics explainer conscience

explainerrelationships

by the ethics centre 17 nov 2017

conscience describes two things – what a person believes is right and how a person decides what is right

 more than just gut instinct our conscience is a moral muscle 



by informing us of our values and principles it becomes the standard we
use to judge whether or not our actions are ethical



we can call these two roles ethical awareness and ethical decision
making



ethical awareness

this is our ability to recognise ethical values and principles



the medieval philosopher thomas aquinas believed our conscience emerged
from synderesis the spark of conscience 

 he literally meant the human
mind s ability to understand the world in moral terms

 conscience was
the process by which a person brought the principles of synderesis into
a practical situation through our decisions



ethical decision making

this is our ability to make practical decisions informed by ethical
values and principles



in his writings aristotle described phronesis the goodness of
practical reason

 this was the ability to evaluate a situation clearly
so we would know how to act virtuously under the circumstances



a conscience which is both well formed shaped by education and
experience and well informed aware of facts evidence and so on
enables us to know ourselves and our world and act accordingly



seeing conscience in this way is important because it teaches us ethics
is not innate

 by continuously working to understand our surroundings
we strengthen our moral muscle



conscientious objection

in politics much of the debate around conscience concerns the “right
to conscientious objection”



 should prolife doctors be required to perform abortions or refer
 patients to doctors who will


 must priests break the confessional seal and report sex offenders
 who confess to them


 can pacifists be excused from conscription because of their
 opposition to war



for a long time western nations informed by the catholic intellectual
tradition believed in the “primacy of conscience” – the idea that a
person should never be forced to do something they believe is against
their most deeply held values and principles



in recent times particularly in medicine this has come to be
questioned

 australian bioethicist julian savulescu believes doctors
working in the public system should be banned from objecting to
procedures because it compromises patient care



this debate sees a clash between two worldviews – one where people s
foremost responsibility is to their own personal beliefs about what is
good and right and another where this duty is balanced against the needs
of the common good



philosopher michael walzer believes there are situations where you have
a duty to “get your hands dirty” – even if the price is your own sense
of goodness

 in response aristotle might have said “no person wishes
to possess the world if they must first become someone else”

 that is
we can t change who we are or what we believe in for any price
