Ethics
Explainer
:
Conscience

ExplainerRelationships

BY
The
Ethics
Centre

NOV
2017

Conscience
describes
two
things
–
what
a
person
believes
is
right
and
how
a
person
decides
what
is
right
.


More
than
just
‘gut
instinct’
,
our
conscience
is
a
‘moral
muscle’
.



By
informing
us
of
our values
and
principles
,
it
becomes
the
standard
we
use
to
judge
whether
or
not
our
actions
are
ethical
.



We
can
call
these
two
roles
ethical
awareness
and
ethical
decision
making
.



Ethical
Awareness

This
is
our
ability
to
recognise
ethical
values
and
principles
.



The
medieval
philosopher Thomas
Aquinas believed
our
conscience
emerged
from synderesis
:
the
‘spark
of
conscience’
.


He
literally
meant
the
human
mind’s
ability
to
understand
the
world
in
moral
terms
.


Conscience
was
the
process
by
which
a
person
brought
the
principles
of synderesis into
a
practical
situation
through
our
decisions
.



Ethical
Decision
Making

This
is
our
ability
to
make
practical
decisions
informed
by
ethical
values
and
principles
.



In
his
writings
,
Aristotle
described phronesis
:
the
goodness
of
practical
reason
.


This
was
the
ability
to
evaluate
a
situation
clearly
so
we
would
know
how
to
act
virtuously
under
the
circumstances
.



A
conscience
which
is
both
well
formed
(shaped
by
education
and
experience)
and
well
informed
(aware
of
facts
,
evidence
and
so
on)
enables
us
to
know
ourselves
and
our
world
and
act
accordingly
.



Seeing
conscience
in
this
way
is
important
because
it
teaches
us
ethics
is
not
innate
.


By
continuously
working
to
understand
our
surroundings
,
we
strengthen
our
moral
muscle
.



Conscientious
Objection

In
politics
,
much
of
the
debate
around
conscience
concerns
the “right
to conscientious
objection”
.



-
Should
pro-life
doctors
be
required
to
perform
abortions
or
refer

patients
to
doctors
who
will
?


-
Must
priests
break
the
confessional
seal
and
report
sex
offenders

who
confess
to
them
?


-
Can
pacifists
be
excused
from
conscription
because
of
their

opposition
to
war
?



For
a
long
time
,
Western
nations
,
informed
by
the
Catholic
intellectual
tradition
,
believed
in
the
“primacy
of
conscience”
–
the
idea
that
a
person
should
never
be
forced
to
do
something
they
believe
is
against
their
most
deeply
held
values
and
principles
.



In
recent
times
,
particularly
in
medicine
,
this
has
come
to
be
questioned
.


Australian
bioethicist Julian
Savulescu believes
doctors
working
in
the
public
system
should
be banned
from
objecting to
procedures
because
it
compromises
patient
care
.



This
debate
sees
a
clash
between
two
worldviews
–
one
where
people’s
foremost
responsibility
is
to
their
own
personal
beliefs
about
what
is
good
and
right
and
another
where
this
duty
is
balanced
against
the
needs
of
the
common
good
.



Philosopher Michael
Walzer believes
there
are
situations
where
you
have
a
duty
to
“get
your
hands
dirty”
–
even
if
the
price
is
your
own
sense
of
goodness
.


In
response
,
Aristotle
might
have
said
,
“no
person
wishes
to
possess
the
world
if
they
must
first
become
someone
else”
.


That
is
,
we
can’t
change
who
we
are
or
what
we
believe
in
for
any
price
.
