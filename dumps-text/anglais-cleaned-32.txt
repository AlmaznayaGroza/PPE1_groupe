how sb 1580 defines right of medical conscience and free speech in
health care
by jeff scott esq

 fma general counsel july 20 2023



should a physician be subject to discipline or job termination for
refusing to provide a health care service that the physician has a
sincerely held religious moral or ethical objection to


during the 2023 session the florida legislature answered this question
by passing sb 1580

 in the first section of this bill the legislature
made its position clear on this issue by stating that

it is the intent of the legislature to provide the right of medical
conscience for health care providers and payors to ensure they can care
for patients in a manner consistent with their moral ethical and
religious convictions

 further it is the intent of the legislature that
licensed health care providers and payors be free from threat of
discrimination for providing consciencebased health care



this legislature coupled this “right of medical conscience” with a
provision protecting the “use of free speech by a health care
practitioner” to create a comprehensive legislative package that was a
priority of gov

 ron desantis

 this analysis of sb 1580 will attempt to
explain how these two new provisions affect the practice of medicine


right of medical conscience
sb 1580 creates a new section of the florida statutes¹ that gives health
care providers and health care payors the right to “opt out of
participation in or payment for any health care service on the basis of
a consciencebased objection

”
it is important to note that this right of conscience only applies to a
“health care service

” it does not give a health care provider the right
to refuse to perform job requirements that do not involve the provision
of a health care service or the right to refuse to provide a health
care service to a particular class of individuals

 “health care service”
is defined to mean

medical research medical procedures or medical services including
but not limited to testing diagnosis referral dispensing or
administering any drug medication or device psychological therapy or
counseling research therapy recordmaking procedures set up or
performance of a surgery or procedure or any other care or services
performed or provided by any health care provider



if a health care provider has a consciencebased objection to performing
abortions the provider may not be discriminated against or suffer
adverse action for refusing to perform abortions

 however a provider
may not choose to perform abortions for some patients but not for other
patients based on the patient s race color religion sex or national
origin


the right of conscience is solely attached to a specific health care
service

 a provider can refuse to prescribe contraceptives to hisher
patients but cannot refuse to prescribe contraceptives to only medicaid
recipients

 a provider who elects to provide a particular medical
procedure to hisher patients may not refuse to provide that procedure
to a subset of patients who engage in a certain type of behavior even
if the provider has a consciencebased objection to that behavior


while the bill sponsors made it clear as to what the right of conscience
applies to they left the issue of whether a conscientious objection
exists less certain

 sb 1580 defines a “consciencebased objection” as
an objection based on a sincerely held religious moral or ethical
belief

² as noted in the footnote whether an entity such as an
insurance company has a conscience is determined by existing written
evidence

 if the articles of incorporation for an insurer state that the
company exists to provide health insurance for individuals whose
religion forbids the use of birth control then that insurer will be
safe from adverse action for selling insurance policies that do not
provide coverage for birth control unless of course there is a contrary
federal requirement

 if the company cannot produce a governing
document published guideline or set of policies or regulations it
will not be entitled to assert a right of conscience


individual health care providers³ on the other hand do not have to
produce written evidence attesting to a sincerely held religious moral
or ethical belief

 apparently it will be up to the florida attorney
general as the entity given enforcement authority for this statute to
determine whether a health care provider alleging a violation has a
valid consciencebased objection

 presumably the attorney general will
assess a provider s selfprofessed belief on a casebycase basis in a
manner congruent with the inquiry used for similar laws such as title
vii of the civil rights act of 1964 requiring employers to provide an
accommodation for employee s sincerely held religious beliefs


health care providers and payors who wish to opt out of participation in
or payment for a health care service due to a consciencebased objection
must do the following

 at the time of the objection or as soon as practicable provide
 written notice of the objection to the provider s supervisor or
 employer as applicable


 document the objection to the particular health care service in the
 patient s medical file


 notify patients seeking an appointment for a health care service
 that the provider has a consciencebased objection to of that
 objection before scheduling the appointment


 providers who are students must provide written notice of their
 consciencebased objection to the educational institution at the
 time the objection is made or as soon as practicable



providers who comply with these requirements may not be discriminated
against⁴ or suffer adverse action⁵ for exercising their right of medical
conscience


the right of medical conscience section also includes speech and
whistleblower protections which prohibit discriminating or taking
adverse action against health care providers or payors who report
violations of the new right of medical conscience statute

 this
protection is extended to providers who testify assist or participate
in a proceeding brought by the attorney general to determine if a
violation occurred


interestingly this part of the new law also includes a prohibition on
discriminating against a health care provider or payor for reasons not
related to the right of medical conscience

 protection from
discrimination is extended to the disclosure of information the provider
or payor reasonably believes constitutes

 a violation of any law rule or regulation


 a violation of any ethical guidelines for the provision of any
 medical procedure or service or
 a practice or method of treatment that may put patient health at
 risk or present substantial and specific danger to public health and
 safety



this protection appears to be very broad and could potentially provide
protection in situations as varied as physicians who complain about
health insurance prior authorization procedures or physicians who notify
a hospital of violations of medical staff bylaws


under the original house companion to sb 1580 health care providers and
payors were given a civil cause of action for any violation of the right
of conscience section

 sb 1580 however rejected this approach in favor
of allowing the attorney general to investigate complaints and bring a
civil action for damages injunctive or other appropriate relief and
attorney fees


health care providers and payors who decline to participate in or pay
for a health care service because of a consciencebased objection may
not be held civilly liable on that basis alone


finally acknowledging the existence of federal emtala requirements the
legislature specifically stated that the medical conscience section does
not override any state or federal requirement to provide emergency
medical treatment


use of free speech by a health care practitioner
a bill to ensure the use of free speech by a health care practitioner
was filed as a standalone bill during the 2022 session hb 687sb
1184

 despite support from the governor the bills never made it to the
house or senate floor

 the free speech concept in a different form was
combined with the right of conscience issue in sb 1580 passed out of
both chambers and was approved by the governor less than a week after
the end of session


this scaled down version prohibits a licensing board or the department
of health if there is no board from taking disciplinary action against
a health care practitioner⁶ solely because the practitioner has spoken
or written publicly about a health care service or public policy

 this
includes postings on social media

 this protection does not apply to
speech written communications or social media postings that the
provider uses to provide medical advice or treatment to a specific
patient

 the protection from board discipline also does not apply to
speech or written communication that separately violates a different law
or rule


thus a health care practitioner can basically say anything they like
about health care or public policy regardless of whether the assertion
reflects the actual standard of care or is based on sound scientific
principles as long as it is not made to a specific patient as part of
the medical care of that patient

 unlike the 2022 version there are no
provisions that would impose sanctions on a board that violated this
provision


part of the impetus for this new right of practitioner free speech is
the alleged actions of the american board of medical specialties abms
in dealing with physicians who advocated for alternative treatments for
covid19 or questioned the safety of covid vaccines

 to correct this
perceived overreach the free speech section of sb 1580 includes a
provision that discourages an approved boardcertification recognizing
agency from revoking the certification of a health care practitioner for
speaking or writing about a health care service or public policy

 as
with the licensing boards this protection applies to postings on social
media but does not apply to speech that constitutes medical advice or
treatment to a specific patient


a specialty board that revokes the certification of a provider solely
because the provider exercised their free speech rights under this
section may have their approval revoked by the issuing board

 it is
interesting to note that the specialty boards of the abms are recognized
by statute and not the board of medicine⁷

 as the bom only has the
authority to revoke the approval from a recognizing agency that it has
approved it appears that the bom does not have the authority to hold an
abms specialty board accountable for actions taken in violation of this
section
