Conscious Leadership: What is it and its Benefits

   Consciously acknowledging an error or weakness, as well as a strength,
   is the starting point for learning and generating improvements through
   concrete actions. This is precisely what conscious leadership is about.

   Next, we will provide more information about this new type of
   leadership, explaining its characteristics, the skills involved, and
   the benefits it brings to organizations and their teams.


What is Conscious Leadership?


   The key to this type of leadership is precisely the consciousness of
   the act of leading. It means that being aware is not just about
   realizing it but also about being capable of reflecting on our actions,
   roles, and the repercussions of the actions we execute.

   This type of leadership implies that those in charge of a company’s
   destiny are fully present in their roles, committed, and engaged. Only
   from there can they make conscious decisions, generating trust and
   inspiring teams.

   An essential aspect of practicing conscious leadership is taking
   responsibility for mistakes and learning from them, while also
   analyzing successes to replicate them. All of this is done in order to
   better guide teams and the company.


Difference from Traditional Leadership

   Conscious leadership and traditional leadership are not differentiated
   by just a single word. While traditional leadership focuses on
   achieving economic results, conscious leadership places emphasis on
   three aspects of value generation within the company: profitability,
   social development, and environmental care.

   Additionally, traditional leadership revolves around a leader who
   prioritizes these results over personal attributes when making
   decisions, whereas conscious leadership requires a leader who seeks
   self-awareness. This entails understanding one’s strengths and
   weaknesses, as well as the importance of making decisions and acting
   with social and ethical responsibility.

   This significant difference makes conscious leadership the result of a
   reflective process in which the leader knows oneself to then know and
   accept others. The challenge lies in promoting and implementing within
   work teams the aspects, qualities, and business skills that echo
   conscious leadership.




The Importance of a Conscious Leader

   A conscious leader is a figure that is increasingly gaining prominence
   in companies. Consciousness applied to decision-making within an
   organization is crucial for leading positive changes. Why? Because it
   allows for the consideration of different variables involved.

   In a way, conscious leadership is based on the idea that conscious
   leaders can make a difference and lead their teams towards excellence,
   happiness, and well-being.

   Adopting this approach by the leader is important, as it can have a
   significant impact on the company’s culture, employee satisfaction, and
   team performance.


Characteristics of a Conscious Leader

   A good conscious leader doesn’t just have to appear to be one, but
   actually be one. Here are some of the general characteristics they
   should possess:
    1. Ability to listen: It’s not always the time to speak, but often the
       time to listen. And it should be done actively, paying attention to
       every detail conveyed by the words and body language of others.
    2. The importance of leading by example: To be a good conscious
       leader, you must preach and practice at the same time. Leading by
       example allows the team to see that you’re the first person to
       align yourself with the principles you promote.
    3. Promoting collaboration: Encourage not only teamwork but also
       collaboration among members of the organization and foster healthy
       competition.
    4. Observational skills: It’s not just about taking action. As a
       conscious leader, you should have the ability to step back and gain
       perspective, observe, and consider alternative options, bringing
       forth new ideas.
    5. Clarity: Decisions should be made with clarity, as the team needs
       to see that you are confident in your actions, which generates the
       necessary trust within the team.
    6. The importance of smiling: It’s important to convey calmness and
       happiness, even in challenging circumstances. Fostering a happy
       team translates into a motivated team that performs better.
    7. Assertiveness: Communication from a conscious leader is
       consistently assertive. They express their thoughts and ideas
       honestly and simply. This allows each team member to know what is
       expected of them, fostering confidence and clarity in their work
       lives.
    8. Recognizing mistakes: As mentioned earlier, a conscious leader is
       based on self-awareness, which involves recognizing mistakes.
       Acknowledging mistakes is the foundation for improvement and
       change. This is not seen as a weakness by the team but rather as a
       sign of a human leader who is continuously striving for
       improvement.


Advantages of Conscious Leadership

   When it comes to benefits, there are several advantages associated with
   conscious leadership, such as the following:
    1. Better understanding of the company’s vision: Conscious leadership
       involves identifying and calibrating the different and most
       important aspects of the organization so that the team can focus on
       them. A conscious leader considers goals in relation to the purpose
       and vision of the company.
    2. Talent development: Conscious leadership attracts talent to
       companies. Moreover, through the development of good practices,
       talent chooses to stay because it’s not about retention but rather
       growth.
    3. Improved work relationships: As mentioned before, a conscious
       leader promotes positive teamwork and collaboration. This leads to
       better project outcomes and fewer interpersonal conflicts since the
       emphasis is on group performance rather than individual
       contributions.
    4. Increased job satisfaction: It’s not just about directing, but also
       about motivating teams and helping them improve. Encouraging them
       to become drivers of change and innovation within the company.
    5. Higher productivity: When employees feel valued, engaged,
       motivated, and satisfied, employee turnover decreases, and
       absenteeism reduces, resulting in increased productivity.
    6. Inspiring leadership: Soft skills are promoted, which allow for
       greater well-being from within to the outside. Being at peace with
       oneself translates into being at peace with others.
