Collective consciousness, collective conscience, or collective conscious
(French: conscience collective) is the set of shared beliefs, ideas, and
moral attitudes which operate as a unifying force within society.^([1])
In general, it does not refer to the specifically moral conscience, but
to a shared understanding of social norms.^([2])

The modern concept of what can be considered collective consciousness
includes solidarity attitudes, memes, extreme behaviors like group-think
and herd behavior, and collectively shared experiences during collective
rituals, dance parties,^([3]) and the discarnate entities which can be
experienced from psychedelic use.^([4]) Rather than existing as separate
individuals, people come together as dynamic groups to share resources
and knowledge. It has also developed as a way of describing how an
entire community comes together to share similar values. This has also
been termed "hive mind", "group mind", "mass mind", and "social
mind".^([5])

Historical use of collective consciousness

[edit]

The term was introduced by the French sociologist Émile Durkheim in his
The Division of Labour in Society in 1893. The French word conscience
generally means "conscience", "consciousness", "awareness",^([6]) or
"perception".^([7]) Given the multiplicity of definitions, translators
of Durkheim disagree on which is most appropriate, or whether the
translation should depend on the context. Some prefer to treat the word
'conscience' as an untranslatable foreign word or technical term,
without its normal English meaning.^([8]) As for "collective", Durkheim
makes clear that he is not reifying or hypostasizing this concept; for
him, it is "collective" simply in the sense that it is common to many
individuals;^([9]) cf. social fact.

Scipio Sighele published ‘La Foule Criminele’ one year before Durkheim,
in which he describes emergent characteristics of crowds that don’t
appear in the individuals that form the crowd. He doesn’t call this
collective consciousness, but ‘âme de la foule’ (soul of the
crowd).^([10]) This term returns in Sigmund Freud’s book about mass
psychology and essentially overlaps with Durkheims concept of collective
consciousness.

Theories of collective consciousness

[edit]

Durkheim

[edit]

Durkheim used the term in his books The Division of Labour in Society
(1893), The Rules of the Sociological Method (1895), Suicide (1897), and
The Elementary Forms of Religious Life (1912). In The Division of
Labour, Durkheim argued that in traditional/primitive societies (those
based around clan, family or tribal relationships), totemic religion
played an important role in uniting members through the creation of a
common consciousness. In societies of this type, the contents of an
individual's consciousness are largely shared in common with all other
members of their society, creating a mechanical solidarity through
mutual likeness.

  The totality of beliefs and sentiments common to the average members
  of a society forms a determinate system with a life of its own. It can
  be termed the collective or common consciousness.

  — Émile Durkheim^([11])

In Suicide, Durkheim developed the concept of anomie to refer to the
social rather than individual causes of suicide. This relates to the
concept of collective consciousness, as if there is a lack of
integration or solidarity in society then suicide rates will be
higher.^([12])

Gramsci

[edit]

Antonio Gramsci states, “A collective consciousness, which is to say a
living organism, is formed only after the unification of the
multiplicity through friction on the part of the individuals; nor can
one say that ‘silence’ is not a multiplicity.”^([13]) A form of
collective consciousness can be formed from Gramsci's conception that
the presence of a hegemony can mobilize the collective consciousness of
those oppressed by the ruling ideas of society, or the ruling hegemony.
Collective consciousness can refer to a multitude of different
individual forms of consciousness coalescing into a greater whole. In
Gramsci's view, a unified whole is composed of solidarity among its
different constituent parts, and therefore, this whole cannot be
uniformly the same. The unified whole can embrace different forms of
consciousness (or individual experiences of social reality), which
coexist to reflect the different experiences of the marginalized peoples
in a given society. This agrees with Gramsci's theory of Marxism and
class struggle applied to cultural contexts. Cultural Marxism (as
distinguished from the right-wing use of the term) embodies the concept
of collective consciousness. It incorporates social movements that are
based on some sort of collective identity; these identities can include,
for instance, gender, sexual orientation, race, and ability, and can be
incorporated by collective-based movements into a broader historical
material analysis of class struggle.

According to Michelle Filippini, “The nature and workings of collective
organisms – not only parties, but also trade unions, associations and
intermediate bodies in general – represent a specific sphere of
reflection in the Prison Notebooks, particularly in regard to the new
relationship between State and society that in Gramsci's view emerged
during the age of mass politics.”^([14]) Collective organisms can
express collective consciousness. Whether this form of expression finds
itself in the realm of the state or the realm of society is up to the
direction that the subjects take in expressing their collective
consciousness. In Gramsci's Prison Notebooks, the ongoing conflict
between civil society, the bureaucracy, and the state necessitates the
emergence of a collective consciousness that can often act as an
intermediary between these different realms. The public organizations of
protest, such as labor unions and anti-war organizations, are vehicles
that can unite multiple types of collective consciousness. Although
identity-based movements are necessary for the progress of democracy and
can generate collective consciousness, they cannot completely do so
without a unifying framework. This is why anti-war and labor movements
provide an avenue that has united various social movements under the
banner of a multiple collective consciousness. This is also why future
social movements need to have an ethos of collective consciousness if
they are to succeed in the long-term.

Zukerfield

[edit]

Zukerfield states that “The different disciplines that have studied
knowledge share an understanding of it as a product of human subjects –
individual, collective, etc.”^([15]) Knowledge in a sociological sense
is derived from social conditions and social realities. Collective
consciousness also reflects social realities, and sociological knowledge
can be gained through the adoption of a collective consciousness. Many
different disciplines such as philosophy and literature examine
collective consciousness from different lenses. These different
disciplines reach a similar understanding of a collective consciousness
despite their different approaches to the subject. The inherent
humanness in the idea of collective consciousness refers to a shared way
of thinking among human beings in the pursuit of knowledge.

Collective consciousness can provide an understanding of the
relationship between self and society. As Zukerfeld states, “Even though
it impels us, as a first customary gesture, to analyse the subjective
(such as individual consciousness) or intersubjective bearers (such as
the values of a given society), in other words those which Marxism and
sociology examine, now we can approach them in an entirely different
light.”^([16]) “Cognitive materialism”^([15]) is presented in the work
by Zukerfeld as a sort of ‘third way’ between sociological knowledge and
Marxism. Cognitive materialism is based on a kind of collective
consciousness of the mind. This consciousness can be used, with
cognitive materialism as a guiding force, by human beings in order to
critically analyze society and social conditions.

Collective consciousness in society

[edit]

Society is made up of various collective groups, such as the family,
community, organizations, regions, nations which as Burns and Egdahl
state "can be considered to possess agential capabilities: to think,
judge, decide, act, reform; to conceptualize self and others as well as
self's actions and interactions; and to reflect.".^([17]) It is
suggested that these different national behaviors vary according to the
different collective consciousness between nations. This illustrates
that differences in collective consciousness can have practical
significance.

According to a theory, the character of collective consciousness depends
on the type of mnemonic encoding used within a group (Tsoukalas, 2007).
The specific type of encoding used has a predictable influence on the
group's behavior and collective ideology. Informal groups, that meet
infrequently and spontaneously, have a tendency to represent significant
aspects of their community as episodic memories. This usually leads to
strong social cohesion and solidarity, an indulgent atmosphere, an
exclusive ethos and a restriction of social networks. Formal groups,
that have scheduled and anonymous meetings, tend to represent
significant aspects of their community as semantic memories which
usually leads to weak social cohesion and solidarity, a more moderate
atmosphere, an inclusive ethos and an expansion of social
networks.^([18])

Literary and oral tradition

[edit]

In a case study of a Serbian folk story, Wolfgang Ernst examines
collective consciousness in terms of forms of media, specifically
collective oral and literary traditions. "Current discourse analysis
drifts away from the 'culturalist turn' of the last two or three decades
and its concern with individual and collective memory as an extended
target of historical research".^([19]) There is still a collective
consciousness present in terms of the shared appreciation of folk
stories and oral traditions. Folk stories enable the subject and the
audiences to come together around a common experience and a shared
heritage. In the case of the Serbian folk “gusle”,^([20]) the Serbian
people take pride in this musical instrument of epic poetry and oral
tradition and play it at social gatherings. Expressions of art and
culture are expressions of a collective consciousness or expressions of
multiple social realities.
