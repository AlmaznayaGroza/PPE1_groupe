conscience – an evil conscience part 4 – good and evil are the only two forms of conscience



study aired november 4 2023

our inherent nature of an evil conscience knows to do good and doesn t


such a one rightly divides the truth from error and is bewitched to
disobediently choose error



 1pe 315  but sanctify the lord god in your hearts where conscience
 resides and be ready always to give an answer to every man that
 asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear
 prompted by a good conscience

 how


 1pe 316  having a good conscience that whereas they speak evil of
 you as of evildoers they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your
 good conversation in christ



 heb 1022 let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of
 faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our
 bodies washed with pure water



hebrews 1022 is the only verse in the bible that directly refers to an
“evil conscience

” however as previously pointed out the bible abounds
with stark nuances of both forms of a good or evil conscience

 it is
impossible to speak about specific evil consciences without juxtaposing
them with their corresponding good conscience



as we have seen in the preceding studies a good conscience is
dramatically differentiated by adam and eve partaking of the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil

 subsequently a pandora s box of evil
conscience blooms like leavening in bread dough



as such mr barid s order of sixteen headings for his conscience study
does not descend in order of authority but rather it is in order of
scriptural reference



1

 1

 1

 the natural conscience
 2

 a defiled conscience
 3

 an evil conscience
 4

 a convicting conscience
 5

 a purged conscience
 6

 a pacified conscience
 7

 a good conscience
 8

 an answering conscience
 9

 a pure conscience
 10

 a witnessing conscience
 11

 a conscience void of offence
 12

 an emboldened conscience
 13

 a wounded conscience
 14

 a weak conscience
 15

 a seared conscience
 16

 an abandoned conscience

our study today is on an “evil conscience” yet when we review the above
headings the vast majority of them are all aspects of an evil
conscience

 nonetheless it is the saint s godgiven passion to study
every detail of his word leaving nothing alive that breathes of
misunderstanding and thus our continuation of the sixteen mostly evil
versions of our conscience



clearly adam and cain within us initiated the many forms of evil
consciences yet the first time the term is directly used is in hebrews
1022 the entire bible bleeding defiled evil consciences from the
beginning to near the end



hebrews 10 admonishes us to remain faithful to the new covenant in
christ and not regress to the laws of moses so etched in our hearts that
we temporarily battle a dual of tortured consciences as paul did
regarding circumcision



 heb 1019  having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the
 holiest by the blood of jesus
 heb 1020  by a new and living way one that literally leads to life
 eternal which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is
 to say his flesh revealing the path to a more excellent conscience
 heb 1021  and having an high priest over the house of god
 heb 1022  let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of
 faith having our hearts sprinkled a sprinkle little by little is
 the beginning of a storm a flood of truth from an evil conscience
 and our bodies washed with pure water


 heb 1023  let us hold fast the new profession of our faith without
 wavering for he is faithful that promised 

christ s mission was to declare the father and our worship of him in
spirit and in truth

 formally israel worshiped god by attempting to
keep his laws through physical washings and sacrifices that most
certainly caused his people a good conscience via those laws

 yet as
depicted by saul who became paul his pricked conscience while under
the slavery of the old covenant was subliminally aware of a strange new
conscience opposing most turbulently his established beliefs

 paul s
boldness became dramatically evident through his earthquake of
miraculous blindness as he whimpered ”who art thou lord

” and the
lord said i am jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick
against the pricks

 acts 9

paul s conscience was kicking against the pricks of his murderous ways
and imploring eyes staring back at him upon his many stonings as he
demanded the church of the day adhere to moses s laws subliminally he
couldn t identify why these people over whom he lorded authority
couldn t and wouldn t remain as faithful as he

 a new disconcerting
spirit of change was blowing upon his mind



by the one who had the power to change the way mankind worshiped god
christ cast aside the physicality of the old covenant to create in man a
worship of god by the same laws only by spirit and not by sweat

 it was
a shift in how each of us now perceived what constituted an evil
conscience and was earthshattering

 that seismic shift in how to live
by the law was quickly realized to be immensely liberating

 its
overpowering joy eclipsed martyrdom as steven exemplified in acts 7



 heb 711  if therefore perfection were by the levitical priesthood
 for under it the people received the law what further need was
 there that another priest should rise after the order of melchisedec
 and not be called after the order of aaron

 
 heb 712  for the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity
 a change also of the law

 
 heb 713  for he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another
 tribe of which no man gave attendance at the altar

 
 heb 714  for it is evident that our lord sprang out of juda of which
 tribe moses spake nothing concerning priesthood



unlike paul moses wasn t given or ready to have his conscience pricked
by a better conscience by the holy spirit

 heb 715  and it is yet far more evident for that after the
 similitude of melchisedec there ariseth another priest 
 heb 716  who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment but
 after the power of an endless life

 
 heb 717  for he testifieth thou art a priest for ever after the
 order of melchisedec

 
 heb 718  for there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going
 before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof


 heb 719  for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a
 better hope did by the which we draw nigh unto god

 
 heb 720  and inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest
 heb 721  for those priests were made without an oath but this with
 an oath by him that said unto him the lord sware and will not repent
 thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec 
 heb 722  by so much was jesus made a surety of a better testament


 heb 723  and they truly were many priests because they were not
 suffered to continue by reason of death 
 heb 724  but this man because he continueth ever hath an
 unchangeable priesthood



 governed by a pure conscience

 

 heb 725  wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that
 come unto god by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for
 them


 heb 726  for such an high priest became us who is holy harmless a
 pure conscience casts out all fear undefiled separate from sinners
 and made higher than the heavens 
 heb 727  who needeth not daily as those high priests to offer up
 sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the people s for this
 he did once when he offered up himself

 
 heb 728  for the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity
 but the word of the oath which was since the law maketh the son who
 is consecrated for evermore

 

hebrews 7 highlights the most profound shift of a good conscience to a
means to attain a pure conscience through christ our high priest


stephen was so committed to the spirit of a good conscience of greater
purity that he was willing to be martyred

 stephen christ and all the
martyrs of old all died having acted in good faith in accordance with
their consciences defying an evil conscience and so too does the
bride of christ

 from that foundation arises the focus of this study and
our immovable confidence

 heb 1022  let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of
 faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our
 bodies washed with pure water



for those given understanding what a glorious and most joyful release
it is to be under christ s light yoke where he is the author of the
temple he is constructing



the following scriptures annul an evil conscience



 1jn 318  my little children let us not love in word neither in
 tongue but in deed and in truth

 
 1jn 319  and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall
 assure our hearts before him



there in the above scripture lies a conscience that is a foundation to
rightly discern the truth and in the below scripture the bisection of
choosing by his will a good or evil conscience



 1jn 320  for if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart
 and knoweth all things



if we are an elect of god he assures us that our heart that is our
mind will know the difference between a good and evil conscience and
our lord will provide the power for us to ultimately learn to choose
righteously



 1jn 321  beloved if our heart condemn us not then have we
 confidence toward god


 1jn 322  and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep
 his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight



how easy is it to simply ask our lord to give us a pure conscience in
all that we think

 if we thus have that pure conscience we are keeping
all the commandments of christ and our hope in the first resurrection
lord willing will be assured



 1jn 323  and this is his commandment that we should believe on the
 name of his son jesus christ and love one another as he gave us
 commandment


 1jn 324  and he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him and he
 in him

 and hereby we know that he abideth in us by the spirit which
 he hath given us in practising a good conscience



we have seen that we can t have light without knowing darkness and
comparably a good conscience without knowing an evil conscience

 let s
review some everyday examples of us being assailed by an evil
conscience namely the seemingly imperishable lust of the eyes the lust
of the flesh and the pride of life



in the old covenant an evil conscience was somewhat foreign to lust yet
still pricked their consciences



 mat 198  he christ saith unto them the apostles moses because of
 the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but
 from the beginning it was not so


 mat 199  and i say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife
 except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth
 adultery and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit
 adultery

 

wow

 what an indictment of a good conscience that mankind subliminally
from the beginning as did adam eve and cain at heart knew by their
subsequent actions of hiding revealed an evil heart against what
constituted a good conscience



 mat 527  ye have heard that it was said by them of old time thou
 shalt not commit adultery 
 mat 528  but i say unto you that whosoever looketh on a woman to
 lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart



in matthew 5 christ is instituting the spirit of keeping all his
commandments resulting in growing a perfect conscience as he and the
father perpetually exist without contrast



yet like cain and paul their consciences beheld a shadowy dichotomy of
a pricked conscience suggesting something spiritually awry

 with that
same conscience solomon who is who we are before knowing christ
withheld from himself no lust as seen in ecclesiastes 210

 solomon and
everyone under the old covenant were blessed materially for their lawful
dedication to loving god

 their physical wealth denoted their love for
god in a shadowy good conscience and was evidence of their righteous
living



 deu 1126  behold i the lord before israel set before you this day
 a blessing and a curse
 deu 1127  a blessing if ye obey the commandments of the lord your
 god which i command you this day and resulting good conscience
 deu 1128  and a curse if ye will not obey the commandments of the
 lord your god and resulting evil conscience but turn aside out of
 the way which i command you this day to go after other gods which ye
 have not known and assuredly a resulting evil conscience



as earlier expressed much later achan under those commandments  knew
by his evil conscience that he had done wrong since he hid his treasure
in the ground beneath his tent

 the spirit of keeping the lord s
commands was already evident by the conviction of their old covenant
hearts



jesus being flesh lived in perfectly good conscience yet he knew that
he was subject to an evil conscience by virtue of being tempted to
acquiesce with an evil conscience in submitting to the devil s wiles 
evil was present within his flesh as it is in us yet he didn t sin but
we do



 mar 1018  and jesus said unto him why callest thou me good

 there is
 none good but one that is god



we all as solomon if given to honestly study our consciences would
conclude that our lusts are vanity a vapour of joy unable to be
retained

 solomon came close to understanding the misty conclusion of
his polarised conscience confusing him while he did his best to live by
the laws of moses and yet knew some unidentifiable spirit couldn t be
grasped

 that missing something was the unheardof holy spirit that
urges a pure conscience that later in his experiences with the
shulamite he frustratingly continued to see blackness

 christ s love
isn t awakened in solomon and the world until he pleases in the
resurrection to judgment son 84

 the lord s double portion of love in
the brilliant light of his word is only awakened in his bride since
christ



 ecc 112  i the preacher was king over israel in jerusalem


 ecc 113  and i gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom
 concerning all things that are done under heaven this sore travail
 hath god given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith



life s experiences only produced struggles against sin to be always
faced with the junction of choosing by our lord s hand a pathway of
either a good or evil conscience



 ecc 114  i have seen all the works that are done under the sun and
 behold all is vanity and vexation of spirit



our works always cause us to constantly be vexed by having to choose the
route of a good or evil conscience

 

 ecc 115  that which is crooked cannot be made straight and that
 which is wanting cannot be numbered



we are constantly besieged by the choice of a good or evil pathway of
conscience

 

 pro 218  the way of him that is laden with guilt is exceeding
 crooked but as for the pure conscience his work is right



 ecc 116  i communed with mine own heart my conscience

 saying lo
 i am come to great estate and have gotten more wisdom than all they
 that have been before me in jerusalem yea my heart had great
 experience of wisdom and knowledge


 ecc 117  and i gave my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and
 folly i perceived that this also is vexation of spirit



there in that preceding verse is solomon s shulamitelike vexation of
knowing that unidentifiable something we know as the holy spirit was
missing from his vast wisdom



 ecc 118  for in much wisdom is much grief and he that increaseth
 knowledge increaseth sorrow

 

without the holy spirit to prick our consciences when in babylon we as
did solomon experienced an indefinable sorrow where immense physical
prosperity and wives churches eluded our quest for peace and perfect
joy always searching but never coming to the truth

 our dichotic
consciences increased sorrow



 ecc 29  so i was great and increased more than all that were before
 me in jerusalem also my wisdom remained with me


 ecc 210  and whatsoever mine eyes desired i kept not from them i
 withheld not my heart from any joy for my heart rejoiced in all my
 labour and this was my portion of all my labour



there is some truth that in good conscience particularly solomon in
his time and remnants of us in babylon believe that it is our right to
pursue any joy of the flesh as long as we use our “wisdom” to not
directly contravene christ s laws

 the major snag is that riches afford
unrestrained pursuit of pleasure so the more powerful bias is to love
them more than our lord s greater riches of his commandments



 gal 516  this i say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfil
 the lust of the flesh

 
 gal 517  for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit
 against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so
 that ye cannot do the things that ye would



 luk 1426  if any man come to me and hate not his father and mother
 and wife and children and brethren and sisters yea and his own
 life also he cannot be my disciple

 
 luk 1427  and whosoever doth not bear his cross and come after me
 cannot be my disciple



 mat 1929  and every one that hath forsaken houses or brethren or
 sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my
 name s sake shall receive an hundredfold and shall inherit
 everlasting life



with an elusive shulamitelike epiphany solomon was further vexed by
his conscience

 with classic introspection he says 

 ecc 211  then i looked on all the works that my hands had wrought
 and on the labour that i had laboured to do and behold all was
 vanity and vexation of spirit and there was no profit under the sun



how utterly frustrating it is in babylon when a mist of christ s spirit
for the most part veils our conscience

 when given a stephenlike
revelation upon keeping all the commandments of god a good conscience
hailstones our understanding washing away the multitude of lies and
outshining all vexations of darkness



probably the most exceptional lust for a male is what is highlighted in
being taken out of him in the form of a woman

 if the majority of his
femininity wasn t placed in front of him in the form of eve to see
himself he would have had only a vague solomonlike understanding of
his evil nature

 being facetoface with his own flesh is highly
arousing to lust for all kinds of spiritual ethnicities as did solomon
 and us with captivating doctrines while not understanding that they
all represent the same ruling deception

 a man s wife mirrors himself as
having a heart that ensnares his conscience with evil and fetters his
hands to excuse himself and hide from sin ecc 72529

 she is the
reflection of his narcissism and he is unwittingly taken by his own
beauty having ascended to heaven unconsciously to presume a dethroning
of god

 while pricked by a good conscience he is so easily led away by
his lust and conceit to be god flattering himself seems the more at
least temporal joy

 like esau s fleeting passion to satiate his
famished state we always have time to reflect upon our choice of
conscience

 if a semblance of righteousness resides we should be
stabbed through our liver with an evil conscience for not fully
considering the lord s commandments



 pro 623  for the commandment is a lamp and the law is light and
 reproofs of instruction are the way of life and peace through a good
 conscience
 pro 624  to keep thee from the evil woman from the flattery of the
 tongue of a strange woman the strange woman within ruling our
 conscience


 pro 625  lust not after her beauty in thine heart neither let her
 take thee with her eyelids

 
 pro 626  for by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece
 of bread and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life we buy
 our own lies by indulging the whore within


 pro 627  can a man take fire in his bosom and his clothes not be
 burned

 
 pro 628  can one go upon hot coals and his feet not be burned


 pro 629  so he that goeth in to his neighbour s wife whosoever
 toucheth her shall not be innocent

 

satan went into eve adam s wife tempted her and spiritually
impregnated her mind with his lying spirit of another jesus 
insidiously himself



 jas 112  blessed is the man that endureth temptation in this case
 choosing a good or evil conscience for when he is tried he shall
 receive the crown of life which the lord hath promised to them that
 love him

 
 jas 113  let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for
 god cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man god
 doesn t have an evil conscience to tempt anybody 
 jas 114  but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own
 lust and enticed

  with his bias towards an evil conscience
 jas 115  then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and
 the knowledge of an evil conscience that is amplified to hide the
 sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death



the famous german philosopher friedrich nietzsche said “a bad
conscience is easier to cope with than a bad reputation

” why

 because a
bad conscience is mostly contrived in secret whereas a bad reputation
is humiliating and mostly for everyone to see

 we are more likely to
fear another s condemnation rather than god s since god seems far off
and not in our faces

 it is easier in the short term to hide a bad
reputation even with having to live with the amplification of an evil
conscience forever



 pro 910  the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and the
 knowledge of the holy is understanding



 luk 235  yea a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also that
 the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed



we can accuse excuse and run and hide all we like from an evil
conscience but are guaranteed to face the music of the last trump
heralding our judgment either in this age or the next



as stated in the previous studies in this series by being made from the
outset in adam having a trace of our lord s spirit we know as adam
proved a conscience when we are disobedient to god s laws

 if we
weren t by default disobedient we wouldn t have known a good
conscience



 gen 34  and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely
 die 
 gen 35  for god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your
 eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil



god gave us his power to have dominion over what we take into our minds
as spiritual food and to learn not to believe in the power of the beast
within to pursue every foul spirit of doctrine

 he says

 gen 126  and god said let us make man in our image after our
 likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and
 over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth
 and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth



in gen 126 our lord says parabolically that he will give us first
physical power and later his power his spirit prior to being faced
with a fork in the road of knowledge and thoughts to choose good or evil
and a resulting conscience



conclusion

it is impossible to escape the godgiven choice of good and evil and the
corresponding consciences



the bride of christ is most grateful for her lord making “all things”
hers to experience 1co 322 the good equally with the day of evil to
cause both a good and evil conscience to be astronomically impactful


there is no escaping hiding among the trees and passing the buck when
discovered only to vainly excuse ourselves from the evil that we are
since our thoughts already condemn us before displaying a pair of bare
butts bobbing at speed through the brush



 gen 65  and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the
 earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was
 only evil continually



 heb 412  for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than
 any twoedged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and
 spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the
 thoughts and intents of the heart



 rev 2214  blessed are they that do his commandments that they may
 have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates
 into the city



such a person rightly divides the truth from error

 his foundation of
judgment is guided by the holy spirit of truth and with a good
conscience condemns his warring evil conscience

l

if we love lying we love our bias for an evil conscience one that in
a sooncoming study runs the grave risk of a “seared conscience” that
is impervious to a good conscience



 rev 2215  for without are dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and
 murderers and idolaters and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie



 rev 27  he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto
 the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of
 life which is in the midst of the paradise of god
