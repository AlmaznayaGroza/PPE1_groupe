the bite of conscience like the bite of a dog into stone is a

 introduction

each of us has at one time or another talked about our conscience

 we
might have been “pricked by our conscience” or our conscience might have
“butted in” when it was not wanted

 we might be going on quite happily
telling a lie to a friend or might have accidentally walked out of a
shop without paying for something and it is our conscience that makes us
confess or stops us in our tracks spins us on our heels and takes us
back into the shop



people from different walks of life talk of the “conscience” from the
religious believer the politician the celebrity to every day folk we
might hear someone berate their conscience for nagging them to do
something they do not want to

 people might be labelled “conscientious
objectors” because they feel their conscience is telling them to object
to certain political actions e

g

 war

 a protester might lament the
erosion of their “freedom of conscience”

 and we can find concepts very
similar to “conscience” in many nonchristian religious traditions both
eastern and western throughout history and from around the globe

1

however the nature of conscience is obscure and consequently the
philosophical discussion of conscience is complex and has a long
history

 it draws on issues in philosophical psychology philosophy of
religion epistemology philosophy of mind applied ethics normative
ethics and metaethics



in this chapter we ll give a general overview of two theories of
conscience

 one draws on aquinas s account the other sigmund freud s
1856–1939

 although freud is not typically seen as a philosopher he s
a psychologist his account will provide us with some insights which
allows us to think philosophically about this thing we call “the
conscience”



2

 the history of conscience

in the twentyfirst century conscience is not thought of as solely a
religious idea

 however talk of “conscience” was popularised at least
in “the west” due to its adoption by both protestant and catholic
traditions

 in this section we ll look how “conscience” is and has
been used in order to draw out some general features



“conscience” played a role in one of the most famous speeches in the
protestant reformation

 martin luther 1483–1546 being charged with
heresy and being forced to recant by charles v stands his grounds and
says “here i stand i can do no other” and “i cannot nor will i retract
anything since it is never safe nor virtuous to go against conscience”


luther believed that his godgiven conscience was not allowing him to
recant not even under the considerable pressure by the powerful people
before him

 or consider a more recent example



in the midst of political turmoil of the civil rights movement martin
luther king jr

 who was under threat and constant pressure to change
his views said

but conscience asks the question is it right

 and there comes a time
when we must take a position that is neither safe nor politic nor
popular but one must take it because it is right

2

conscience is then powerful

 it seems that it can move a person to put
themselves in mortal danger to “stand up and be counted” to act
contrary to selfinterest



but it is not just saints and heroes that talk of conscience conscience
has been cited by the most repugnant and morally abhorrent people who
have ever lived racists murderers tyrants dictators

 for example as
bettina stangneth s states in eichmann before jerusalem the unexamined
life of a mass murderer3 a discussion of the inner life of one of the
nazi s most notorious officers “conscience was simply the morality of
the fatherland that dwells within a person which eichmann also termed
 the voice of the blood ”



conscience can be male or female or both or neither it can be one voice
or many it can echo religious ideas social ideas racist ideas lofty
ideas or ideas found in the filth of human corruption

 conscience can
develop at any particular age and dissipates at any age

 it does not
“speak” and it does “speak” and does not have a language of choice


all of these observations then leave a number of observations and
questions



there seem to be at least three related functions that we think the
conscience plays

 first it tells us what we ought to do as a guide for
our lives

 second it is a source of moral knowledge

 that is we might
say “i know that stealing a pen is wrong because my conscience told me”


third it might be thought of as a motivation

 that is it might be the
thing that actually gets us up out of our seat to act in certain ways
even when things are difficult or even life threatening



just to clarify we can see the difference in the first two of these
functions if we think of a tyrant who says for example “my conscience
tells me i have to kill all mentally ill people to help the country”


clearly this is a case where her conscience is telling her how she ought
to behave

 but given that we think that killing the mentally ill is
morally wrong we do not want to say that in this case her conscience
gives her knowledge of what is right and wrong

 so it might be true that
the conscience gives us guidance but not knowledge



equally the opposite seems true that we might know what is right and
wrong yet fail to be guided to do it

 this predicament is what
shakespeare captured in this famous quotation “conscience doth make
cowards of us all” hamlet 3

1

78–82



consider another point

 conscience is subjective in that it is about one
reflecting inwards on oneself on how one might “feel” about certain
things

 it is not about looking out into the world at a set of rules or
laws

 we experience the conscience differently than we would if a
friend priest politician or imam was telling us what to do

 of course
although conscience is “inward looking” that is not the same as saying
that we just make up what the conscience allegedly tells us

 for
instance we might think that what is right and wrong is dependent on
god but also think that we come to know what is right and wrong through
our conscience



finally it is worth noting that the term “conscience” was only
formalized in its modern moral meaning in the mid eighteenth century
e

g

 neither plato nor aristotle talk of conscience

 however note
that just because a term is modern or just because there is
disagreement with how a term is used that does not mean that the ideas
themselves are new



consider the point that the terms “molecules” and “atoms” were recent
inventions and that in their development they might be used to talk
about different things and they engendered disagreement within the
scientific community

 this in itself does not lead us to the conclusion
that there are no molecules and no atoms

 so the lack of term
“conscience” and disagreement about what “conscience” means does not
mean that conscience is merely an “invention”

 with all these points in
mind let s consider one of the key thinkers in relation to conscience
aquinas



3

 aquinas on conscience

if you recall from aquinas developed a natural law theology

 the basic
idea is that through reason what he calls ratio we can come to
recognize certain precepts that we ought to live by

 aquinas thinks that
this reliance on thinking and reflection is revealed in the bible

they show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts
their consciences also bearing witness and their thoughts sometimes
accusing them and at other times even defending them

4

notice then that for paul — and aquinas — the “conscience” bears witness
sometimes accusing the person sometimes defending them

 for aquinas
conscience is morally neutral it simply “bears witness” it is a
“signpost” and after all signposts do not opinions on things see
aquinas summa part 1 question 79 article 13



to be clear then aquinas did not take conscience to be a source of moral
knowledge but as a guide

 this means that aquinas unlike luther and
postreformation thinkers took conscience to be fallible

 for aquinas
we may be wrong in following our conscience as it can move us in the
wrong directionmislead us

for aquinas the conscience is the act of applying the universal
principles the eternaldivine law to actual real life situations



aquinas explicitly defines “conscience” as the “application of knowledge
to activity” summa theologica i–ii i

 so if conscience for aquinas
is about the application of knowledge to activity this raises the
question how we get this knowledge

 this is where another key technical
term is introduced

 the synderesis

 synderesis is not the same as
conscience but is the innate ability of the mind — what he calls a habit
of the mind — to apprehend the eternaldivine laws

 the role of
conscience is to apply the primary precepts discovered as the content of
synderesis



to get a better understanding of synderesis consider someone trying to
work out the quickest way to get between two points

 through rational
reflection they will see that it is the straight line

 this “coming to
recognize through reflection” is what aquinas has in mind when he talks
about synderesis

 for aquinas unlike conscience synderesis is never
mistaken

 humans do wrong thinks aquinas when conscience and not
synderesis makes a mistake

 this means that a failure of conscience
needs to be clearly thought through on aquinas s account



for aquinas conscience errs because of ignorance about how to apply the
eternaldivine laws of which there are two types

 ignorance that can be
overcome by using one s reason vincible ignorance and ignorance that
cannot be overcome by using one s reason invincible ignorance


invincible ignorance is doing something wrong when one could not have
known better vincible ignorance is doing wrong when one ought to have
known better

 but how might this relate to conscience



imagine two people going into a gun shop

 the first person has no
criminal record has never been in trouble with the police nor at school
and they have no record of mental illness

 he is for all intents and
purposes a model citizen

 this person buys a gun and goes on a killing
rampage

 the owner of the shop by following her conscience has not
done something morally wrong because her ignorance is invincible there
was no indication that this would have been a likely outcome



this contrasts to the person who is sold a gun even though he has a
violent criminal record which would have shown up on a basic background
check

 in this case the owner of the gun shop following her conscience
has done something morally wrong because in this case her ignorance is
vincible



to conclude aquinas thinks all of us can know infallibly what is right
and wrong through synderesis

 however even though we are infallible
about this we can and do make mistakes in applying this knowledge

 it
is our conscience conscientia which tells us how to apply this
knowledge and moves us to act

 it can go wrong through ignorance


ignorance which could have been avoided vincible means our action is
morally wrong

 mistakes deriving from ignorance we could not have
avoided invincible means our action is not morally wrong



in the next section we will consider what freud has to say about
conscience and explain how he reconceptualises it as a psychological
and not theological concept and in doing so argues we should not accept
it as an inherently good notion



4

 freud and the conscience

freud is best known as a psychologist and the architect of
psychoanalysis

 he is controversial and most philosophers and
psychologists reject the ideas he presents

 however his ideas have been
incredibly influential and indeed his name has entered our everyday
talk in the form of a “freudian slip”

 among freud s many ideas his
conceptualization of the structure of the mind is key to his views on
conscience

 he thinks the mind can be thought of as containing three
parts the id the ego and the superego

 freud s account of conscience
is understood as the relation between these



for freud the id is the collection of our primal drives e

g

 the basic
desires for food sex drink and is the oldest part of the mind

 the id
cannot be properly formalized or understood and freud likens it to
chaos

 it is instinctive emotional and illogical

 we cannot list all
the drives that make up the id as they are inaccessible to us

 freud has
a nice way of describing the id he calls it “a cauldron full of
seething excitations”

 se xxii

73

 although we can say very little
about the content of the id freud did think that there was a general
principle to help us understand the drives in the id what he calls the
“pleasure principle”

 this is the claim that what identifies and unifies
the drives of the id is the avoidance of pain and pursuit of pleasure



now as a very young child it may be ok to be driven by the pleasure
principle they crawl singlemindedly after the chocolate buttons to put
in their mouth they crave their mother s milk irrespective of anything
else

 however as we develop we soon realize that we cannot simply act
on the primal instincts of the id as we have to navigate ourselves in
the social spaces we inhabit

 we have to understand boundaries
sanctions and consequences

 to successfully operate in the world we
need to consciously reflect and reason and ultimately we have to delay
instinctive behaviour and “weighup” the situation

 put bluntly someone
whose id is unchecked would cease to be acceptable in society and find
themselves physically socially and emotionally isolated

 it is what
freud calls the “ego” which plays this policing role



but if we only have the id and the ego then it is unclear why we would
not simply follow the pleasure principle

 that is although the ego
rationally reflects it needs something to weighup against the id

 we
need some authority that monitors what the ego is doing

 this authority
is what freud calls the superego



early in our life our parents as well as society religious leaders
etc

 tell us what we can and cannot do and chastise us for breaking
rules and as we grow older we internalize these things and “hear them”
as a voice of authority

 imagine that your mum has always told you not
to sit with your elbows on the table then you internalize this rule

 so
when you are much older and not living with your mum any longer the
voice of your “superego” speaks with authority — “take your elbows off
the table

” these are the very basics of freud structure of the mind


our ego balances the primal drives of the id with the voice of authority
from the superego



where does the conscience come in

 for freud the conscience is the form
that the superego takes in addressing the ego

 when the internalized
authority derived from parental socialreligious rules and regulations
controls the ego is it is understood as “the conscience”

 in our last
example it is our “conscience” that tells us to remove our elbows from
the table



notice then that our conscience often requires certain things from us
which we fail to achieve and this gives rise to guilt

 for freud the
conscience can be thought of as synonymous with the “guilty conscience”


our ego is punished through guilt by the form of the superego we call
conscience

 furthermore freud says that when the superego fails to
deal properly with the id — when the pleasure principle is repressed —
this forms what he calls neurosis



you can also hopefully see the differences between aquinas and freud


first the obvious point is that for freud the conscience is not the
voice of god

 second unlike aquinas freud thinks that the conscience
could be bad destructive and unhelpful

 the conscience is the way the
ego experiences the authority of the superego

 but the superego is
arrived at through the experiences we have

 and of course we might
have had really bad experiences growing up where parents are stifling
overly authoritarian distant cold hard violent abusive etc

 in
these sorts of cases the conscience would be stifling overly
authoritarian distant etc

 this means that although freud does not
think we can or should get rid of the conscience he does think we
should treat it with a healthy dose of scepticism and hence not be
kowtowed by the “guilt” that is our ego s punishment for falling short
of the superego conscience is the product of our often nonideal
upbringing rather than a divinelyinspired force for good

 freud s psychosexual development theory

psychosexual development theory is a theory of sexual development from
birth to death

 freud was the first thinker to look at the entire
lifespan in terms of development

 freud thought that as we develop we
move through different stages

 at each stage our libido sex drive is
focused towards different things

 if we fail to move through a stage
completely or return to a stage then problems arise and we might
become fixated with the area associated with that stage

 this can be a
serious problem for our relationships and could be an underlying cause
of mental illness



the first stage is the oral stage from birth to about one and a half


this stage is where babies get pleasure through putting things in their
mouth pleasure in biting chewing and sucking

 for example babies soon
after they are born are breastfeeding and as the baby develops they
navigate and explore the world through putting things in their mouth


notice that during this phase babies are very dependent on others


according to freud at this stage not only do we get information about
the world but we also fulfil the id

 babies who can bite chew and such
as much as they want are being guided by the id

 freud explains
behaviours like smoking chewing gum overeating with failure to move
properly through this stage which prevented the successful development
of the id



the next stage from about one and a half to three years is the anal
stage

 here pleasure is gained through controlling going to the toilet


this stage is about gaining control of one s body and it starts with
controlling the bladder and bowels being potty trained

 it is around
this time that the ego develops

 this control of their bodies is a
source of pride and pleasure for children

 agents who fail to properly
move through this stage are what are sometimes called “anally
retentive”

 that is someone who is overly controlling or out of control
and messy because — according to freud — they do not want to let go of
their waste or do not care where or when they let go of their waste



the next phase of development from about three to six years is the
phallic stage in which a child discovers one s genitals and importantly
that they are different in men and women

 this stage is where freud
thinks we develop the oedipus and the electra complex

 a problematic
phallic stage will cause problems with intimacy in later life



the next stage the latency stage is from six years to the onset of
puberty

 this stage is not about pleasure in the body as the libido is
“latent” or hidden — this is the stage where sexual desire is repressed
and no new sexual desires emerge

 at this stage girls play with girls in
order to learn the role of a girl and boys play with boys in order to
learn about the role of boys



 the child learns how to navigate the
social world

 a difficult latency stage leads to relational problems and
understanding one s gender



the libido then reappears in the final stage which lasts to our death
and which freud calls the mature genital stage

 this is where the
individual not only recognises the difference between men and women but
also shows a desire to engage in a sexual relationship and more
generally a pursuit of pleasure and happiness

 people become sexually
active fall in love and get married

 this is the stage where we acquire
a fully developed conscience



summary

the notion of “conscience” has appeared for thousands of years in
different cultures even though it has not always been called
“conscience”

 modern christian orthodoxy popularised it and
characterised it in relation to god s voice and guidance

 aquinas
thought that conscience is the way we understand how to apply what we
know

 in aquinas s view our conscience is fallible and might guide us
wrongly

 when our conscience “gets it wrong” we can be either culpable —
through vincible ignorance — or not culpable — through invincible
ignorance



freud is less convinced that conscience is a force for good and he is
certain that it has not got anything to do with god

 for freud
conscience can be either a good or bad

 we can think of our mind as
having three parts the id ego and superego

 the conscience for freud
is the form the superego takes when it is trying to keep the ego in
line

 it is internalized as the voice of authority

 the superego is
about following rules but those rules do not come from “on high” they
derive from the upbringing we have had

 so if we have had a repressive
upbringing then the superego — the voice of conscience — will be
repressive

 how we develop these three features of the mind is through
what freud calls psychosexual development if we do not develop
correctly then we become fixated and repressive form a neurosis and
ultimately become mentally ill

 freud thought that this could be avoided
by working through the psychosexual stages in the normal way and can be
treated through psychosexual counselling



common student mistakes

 writing conscious when meaning conscience


 confuse synderesis and conscience


 confusing conscience as guidance with conscience as the source of
 knowledge


 believe freud thinks the conscience is always bad


 thinking that for aquinas conscience is way of knowing what is right
 and wrong


 thinking that because the term conscience is new conscience itself
 is a modern invention



issues to consider

1

 do you think you have a conscience

 what does it tell you


2

 what is the difference between synderesis and conscience


3

 do you think that everyone ultimately knows — if they reason
 correctly — what is right and wrong


4

 what is the difference between vincible and invincible

 is not most
 of the supposedly invincible knowledge really vincible

 we just
 need to try harder


5

 what are the possible different roles for the conscience


6

 could the conscience be a morally bad thing


7

 why does freud think we need to be cautious about listening to our
 conscience


8

 how does freud s account of conscience relate to his psychosexual
 development theory


9

 what do you think about freud s psychosexual development theory


10

 draw up a table of the key stages and accompanying characteristics
 of freud s psychosexual development theory


11

 could it ever make sense to talk about animalsrobots having a
 conscience

 if not why not


12

 do you think conscience will still shape our lives in one thousand
 years
