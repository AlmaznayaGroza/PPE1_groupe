Introduction

Each
of
us
has
,
at
one
time
or
another
,
talked
about
our
conscience
.


We
might
have
been
“pricked
by
our
conscience”
or
our
conscience
might
have
“butted
in”
when
it
was
not
wanted
.


We
might
be
going
on
quite
happily
telling
a
lie
to
a
friend
,
or
might
have
accidentally
walked
out
of
a
shop
without
paying
for
something
and
it
is
our
conscience
that
makes
us
confess
or
stops
us
in
our
tracks
spins
us
on
our
heels
and
takes
us
back
into
the
shop
.



People
from
different
walks
of
life
talk
of
the
“conscience”
,
from
the
religious
believer
,
the
politician
,
the
celebrity
,
to
every
day
folk
;
we
might
hear
someone
berate
their
conscience
for
nagging
them
to
do
something
they
do
not
want
to
.


People
might
be
labelled
“conscientious
objectors”
because
they
feel
their
conscience
is
telling
them
to
object
to
certain
political
actions
,
e
.

g
.


war
.


A
protester
might
lament
the
erosion
of
their
“freedom
of
conscience”
.


And
we
can
find
concepts
very
similar
to
“conscience”
in
many
non-Christian
religious
traditions
both
Eastern
and
Western
throughout
history
and
from
around
the
globe
.

However
,
the
nature
of
conscience
is
obscure
and
consequently
the
philosophical
discussion
of
conscience
is
complex
and
has
a
long
history
.


It
draws
on
issues
in
philosophical
psychology
,
philosophy
of
religion
,
epistemology
,
philosophy
of
mind
,
applied
ethics
,
normative
ethics
and
Metaethics
.



In
this
chapter
we’ll
give
a
general
overview
of
two
theories
of
conscience
.


One
draws
on
Aquinas’s
account
;
the
other
Sigmund
Freud’s
(1856–1939)
.


Although
Freud
is
not
typically
seen
as
a
philosopher
(he’s
a
psychologist)
his
account
will
provide
us
with
some
insights
which
allows
us
to
think
philosophically
about
this
thing
we
call
“the
conscience”
.

The
History
of
Conscience

In
the
twenty-first
century
conscience
is
not
thought
of
as
solely
a
religious
idea
.


However
talk
of
“conscience”
was
popularised
,
at
least
in
“the
West”
,
due
to
its
adoption
by
both
Protestant
and
Catholic
traditions
.


In
this
section
we’ll
look
how
“conscience”
is
,
and
has
been
,
used
in
order
to
draw
out
some
general
features
.



“Conscience”
played
a
role
in
one
of
the
most
famous
speeches
in
the
protestant
reformation
.


Martin
Luther
(1483–1546)
,
being
charged
with
heresy
and
being
forced
to
recant
by
Charles
V
,
stands
his
grounds
and
says
“Here
I
stand
,
I
can
do
no
other”
and
“I
cannot
nor
will
I
retract
anything
,
since
it
is
never
safe
nor
virtuous
to
go
against
conscience”
.


Luther
believed
that
his
God-given
conscience
was
not
allowing
him
to
recant
,
not
even
under
the
considerable
pressure
by
the
powerful
people
before
him
.


Or
consider
a
more
recent
example
.



In
the
midst
of
political
turmoil
of
the
civil
rights
movement
Martin
Luther
King
Jr
.


,
who
was
under
threat
and
constant
pressure
to
change
his
views
said
:

But
,
conscience
asks
the
question
,
is
it
right
?


And
there
comes
a
time
when
we
must
take
a
position
that
is
neither
safe
,
nor
politic
,
nor
popular
,
but
one
must
take
it
because
it
is
right
.

2

Conscience
is
,
then
,
powerful
.


It
seems
that
it
can
move
a
person
to
put
themselves
in
mortal
danger
,
to
“stand
up
and
be
counted”
,
to
act
contrary
to
self-interest
.



But
it
is
not
just
saints
and
heroes
that
talk
of
conscience
,
conscience
has
been
cited
by
the
most
repugnant
and
morally
abhorrent
people
who
have
ever
lived
,
racists
,
murderers
,
tyrants
,
dictators
.


For
example
as
Bettina
Stangneth’s
states
in
Eichmann
Before
Jerusalem
:
The
Unexamined
Life
of
a
Mass
Murderer
,3
a
discussion
of
the
inner
life
of
one
of
the
Nazi’s
most
notorious
officers
:
“Conscience
was
simply
the
‘morality
of
the
Fatherland
that
dwells
within’
a
person
,
which
Eichmann
also
termed
‘the
voice
of
the
blood’”
.



Conscience
can
be
male
or
female
or
both
or
neither
,
it
can
be
one
voice
or
many
,
it
can
echo
religious
ideas
,
social
ideas
,
racist
ideas
,
lofty
ideas
or
ideas
found
in
the
filth
of
human
corruption
.


Conscience
can
develop
at
any
particular
age
and
dissipates
at
any
age
.


It
does
not
“speak”
,
and
it
does
“speak”
,
and
does
not
have
a
language
of
choice
.


All
of
these
observations
then
leave
a
number
of
observations
and
questions
.



There
seem
to
be
(at
least)
three
related
functions
that
we
think
the
conscience
plays
.


First
,
it
tells
us
what
we
ought
to
do
as
a
guide
for
our
lives
.


Second
,
it
is
a
source
of
moral
knowledge
.


That
is
,
we
might
say
“I
know
that
stealing
a
pen
is
wrong
because
my
conscience
told
me”
.


Third
it
might
be
thought
of
as
a
motivation
.


That
is
,
it
might
be
the
thing
that
actually
gets
us
up
out
of
our
seat
to
act
in
certain
ways
,
even
when
things
are
difficult
or
even
life
threatening
.



Just
to
clarify
,
we
can
see
the
difference
in
the
first
two
of
these
functions
if
we
think
of
a
tyrant
who
says
for
example
:
“my
conscience
tells
me
I
have
to
kill
all
mentally
ill
people
to
help
the
country”
.


Clearly
this
is
a
case
where
her
conscience
is
telling
her
how
she
ought
to
behave
.


But
,
given
that
we
think
that
killing
the
mentally
ill
is
morally
wrong
,
we
do
not
want
to
say
that
in
this
case
her
conscience
gives
her
knowledge
of
what
is
right
and
wrong
.


So
it
might
be
true
that
the
conscience
gives
us
guidance
but
not
knowledge
.



Equally
the
opposite
seems
true
,
that
we
might
know
what
is
right
and
wrong
yet
fail
to
be
guided
to
do
it
.


This
predicament
is
what
Shakespeare
captured
in
this
famous
quotation
:
“conscience
doth
make
cowards
of
us
all”
(Hamlet
3
.

1
.

78–82)
.



Consider
another
point
.


Conscience
is
subjective
in
that
it
is
about
one
reflecting
inwards
on
oneself
,
on
how
one
might
“feel”
about
certain
things
.


It
is
not
about
looking
out
into
the
world
,
at
a
set
of
rules
or
laws
.


We
experience
the
conscience
differently
than
we
would
if
a
friend
,
priest
,
politician
or
Imam
was
telling
us
what
to
do
.


Of
course
,
although
conscience
is
“inward
looking”
,
that
is
not
the
same
as
saying
that
we
just
make
up
what
the
conscience
allegedly
tells
us
.


For
instance
,
we
might
think
that
what
is
right
and
wrong
is
dependent
on
God
but
also
think
that
we
come
to
know
what
is
right
and
wrong
through
our
conscience
.



Finally
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
term
“conscience”
was
only
formalized
in
its
modern
moral
meaning
in
the
mid
eighteenth
century
(e
.

g
.


neither
Plato
nor
Aristotle
talk
of
conscience)
.


However
,
note
that
just
because
a
term
is
modern
,
or
just
because
there
is
disagreement
with
how
a
term
is
used
,
that
does
not
mean
that
the
ideas
themselves
are
new
.



Consider
the
point
that
the
terms
“molecules”
and
“atoms”
were
recent
inventions
,
and
that
in
their
development
they
might
be
used
to
talk
about
different
things
,
and
they
engendered
disagreement
within
the
scientific
community
.


This
in
itself
does
not
lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
there
are
no
molecules
and
no
atoms
.


So
the
lack
of
term
“conscience”
,
and
disagreement
about
what
“conscience”
means
does
not
mean
that
conscience
is
merely
an
“invention”
.


With
all
these
points
in
mind
let’s
consider
one
of
the
key
thinkers
in
relation
to
conscience
,
Aquinas
.



3
.


Aquinas
on
Conscience

If
you
recall
from
Aquinas
developed
a
Natural
Law
theology
.


The
basic
idea
is
that
through
reason
(what
he
calls
ratio)
we
can
come
to
recognize
certain
precepts
that
we
ought
to
live
by
.


Aquinas
thinks
that
this
reliance
on
thinking
and
reflection
is
revealed
in
the
Bible
:

They
show
that
the
requirements
of
the
law
are
written
on
their
hearts
,
their
consciences
also
bearing
witness
,
and
their
thoughts
sometimes
accusing
them
and
at
other
times
even
defending
them
.

4

Notice
then
that
for
Paul
—
and
Aquinas
—
the
“conscience”
bears
witness
sometimes
accusing
the
person
,
sometimes
defending
them
.


For
Aquinas
conscience
is
morally
neutral
,
it
simply
“bears
witness”
,
it
is
a
“sign-post”
and
after
all
signposts
do
not
opinions
on
things
(see
Aquinas
,
Summa
,
Part
1
,
Question
79
,
Article
13)
.



To
be
clear
then
Aquinas
did
not
take
conscience
to
be
a
source
of
moral
knowledge
but
as
a
guide
.


This
means
that
Aquinas
,
unlike
Luther
and
post-reformation
thinkers
,
took
conscience
to
be
fallible
.


For
Aquinas
we
may
be
wrong
in
following
our
conscience
as
it
can
move
us
in
the
wrong
direction/mislead
us

For
Aquinas
the
conscience
is
the
act
of
applying
the
universal
principles
(the
Eternal/Divine
law)
to
actual
real
life
situations
.



Aquinas
explicitly
defines
“conscience”
as
the
“application
of
knowledge
to
activity”
(Summa
Theologica
,
I–II
,
I)
.


So
,
if
conscience
for
Aquinas
is
about
the
application
of
knowledge
to
activity
,
this
raises
the
question
how
we
get
this
knowledge
?


This
is
where
another
key
technical
term
is
introduced
.


The
synderesis
.


Synderesis
is
not
the
same
as
conscience
but
is
the
innate
ability
of
the
mind
—
what
he
calls
a
habit
of
the
mind
—
to
apprehend
the
eternal/divine
laws
.


The
role
of
conscience
is
to
apply
the
primary
precepts
discovered
as
the
content
of
synderesis
.



To
get
a
better
understanding
of
synderesis
consider
someone
trying
to
work
out
the
quickest
way
to
get
between
two
points
.


Through
rational
reflection
they
will
see
that
it
is
the
straight
line
.


This
“coming
to
recognize
through
reflection”
is
what
Aquinas
has
in
mind
when
he
talks
about
synderesis
.


For
Aquinas
,
unlike
conscience
,
synderesis
is
never
mistaken
.


Humans
do
wrong
,
thinks
Aquinas
,
when
conscience
(and
not
synderesis)
makes
a
mistake
.


This
means
that
a
failure
of
conscience
needs
to
be
clearly
thought
through
on
Aquinas’s
account
.



For
Aquinas
,
conscience
errs
because
of
ignorance
about
how
to
apply
the
eternal/divine
laws
,
of
which
there
are
two
types
.


Ignorance
that
can
be
overcome
by
using
one’s
reason
(vincible
ignorance)
,
and
ignorance
that
cannot
be
overcome
by
using
one’s
reason
(invincible
ignorance)
.


Invincible
ignorance
is
doing
something
wrong
when
one
could
not
have
known
better
;
vincible
ignorance
is
doing
wrong
when
one
ought
to
have
known
better
.


But
how
might
this
relate
to
conscience
?



Imagine
two
people
going
into
a
gun
shop
.


The
first
person
has
no
criminal
record
,
has
never
been
in
trouble
with
the
police
nor
at
school
and
they
have
no
record
of
mental
illness
.


He
is
,
for
all
intents
and
purposes
,
a
model
citizen
.


This
person
buys
a
gun
and
goes
on
a
killing
rampage
.


The
owner
of
the
shop
,
by
following
her
conscience
,
has
not
done
something
morally
wrong
because
her
ignorance
is
invincible
;
there
was
no
indication
that
this
would
have
been
a
likely
outcome
.



This
contrasts
to
the
person
who
is
sold
a
gun
even
though
he
has
a
violent
criminal
record
which
would
have
shown
up
on
a
basic
background
check
.


In
this
case
,
the
owner
of
the
gun
shop
following
her
conscience
has
done
something
morally
wrong
because
in
this
case
her
ignorance
is
vincible
.



To
conclude
,
Aquinas
thinks
all
of
us
can
know
infallibly
what
is
right
and
wrong
through
synderesis
.


However
,
even
though
we
are
infallible
about
this
,
we
can
,
and
do
,
make
mistakes
in
applying
this
knowledge
.


It
is
our
conscience
(conscientia)
which
tells
us
how
to
apply
this
knowledge
and
moves
us
to
act
.


It
can
go
wrong
through
ignorance
.


Ignorance
which
could
have
been
avoided
(vincible)
means
our
action
is
morally
wrong
.


Mistakes
deriving
from
ignorance
we
could
not
have
avoided
(invincible)
means
our
action
is
not
morally
wrong
.



In
the
next
section
,
we
will
consider
what
Freud
has
to
say
about
conscience
,
and
explain
how
he
reconceptualises
it
as
a
psychological
and
not
theological
concept
,
and
in
doing
so
argues
we
should
not
accept
it
as
an
inherently
good
notion
.

Freud
and
the
Conscience

Freud
is
best
known
as
a
psychologist
and
the
architect
of
psychoanalysis
.


He
is
controversial
and
most
philosophers
and
psychologists
reject
the
ideas
he
presents
.


However
,
his
ideas
have
been
incredibly
influential
,
and
indeed
his
name
has
entered
our
everyday
talk
in
the
form
of
a
“Freudian
slip”
.


Among
Freud’s
many
ideas
his
conceptualization
of
the
structure
of
the
mind
is
key
to
his
views
on
conscience
.


He
thinks
the
mind
can
be
thought
of
as
containing
three
parts
:
the
id
,
the
ego
and
the
super-ego
.


Freud’s
account
of
conscience
is
understood
as
the
relation
between
these
.



For
Freud
the
id
is
the
collection
of
our
primal
drives
,
e
.

g
.


the
basic
desires
for
food
,
sex
,
drink
and
is
the
oldest
part
of
the
mind
.


The
id
cannot
be
properly
formalized
or
understood
and
Freud
likens
it
to
chaos
.


It
is
instinctive
,
emotional
and
illogical
.


We
cannot
list
all
the
drives
that
make
up
the
id
as
they
are
inaccessible
to
us
.


Freud
has
a
nice
way
of
describing
the
id
;
he
calls
it
:
“…a
cauldron
full
of
seething
excitations…”
.


(SE
,
XXII
.

73)
.


Although
we
can
say
very
little
about
the
content
of
the
id
,
Freud
did
think
that
there
was
a
general
principle
to
help
us
understand
the
drives
in
the
id
,
what
he
calls
the
“pleasure
principle”
.


This
is
the
claim
that
what
identifies
and
unifies
the
drives
of
the
id
is
the
avoidance
of
pain
and
pursuit
of
pleasure
.



Now
,
as
a
very
young
child
it
may
be
OK
to
be
driven
by
the
pleasure
principle
;
they
crawl
single-mindedly
after
the
chocolate
buttons
to
put
in
their
mouth
,
they
crave
their
mother’s
milk
irrespective
of
anything
else
.


However
,
as
we
develop
we
soon
realize
that
we
cannot
simply
act
on
the
primal
instincts
of
the
id
as
we
have
to
navigate
ourselves
in
the
social
spaces
we
inhabit
!


We
have
to
understand
boundaries
,
sanctions
and
consequences
.


To
successfully
operate
in
the
world
,
we
need
to
consciously
reflect
and
reason
and
ultimately
,
we
have
to
delay
instinctive
behaviour
and
“weigh-up”
the
situation
.


Put
bluntly
someone
whose
id
is
unchecked
would
cease
to
be
acceptable
in
society
and
find
themselves
physically
,
socially
and
emotionally
isolated
.


It
is
what
Freud
calls
the
“ego”
which
plays
this
policing
role
.



But
if
we
only
have
the
id
and
the
ego
then
it
is
unclear
why
we
would
not
simply
follow
the
pleasure
principle
.


That
is
,
although
the
ego
rationally
reflects
,
it
needs
something
to
weigh-up
against
the
id
.


We
need
some
authority
that
monitors
what
the
ego
is
doing
.


This
authority
is
what
Freud
calls
the
super-ego
.



Early
in
our
life
our
parents
(as
well
as
society
,
religious
leaders
etc
.

)
tell
us
what
we
can
and
cannot
do
and
chastise
us
for
breaking
rules
,
and
as
we
grow
older
we
internalize
these
things
and
“hear
them”
as
a
voice
of
authority
.


Imagine
that
your
mum
has
always
told
you
not
to
sit
with
your
elbows
on
the
table
then
you
internalize
this
rule
.


So
when
you
are
much
older
and
not
living
with
your
mum
any
longer
the
voice
of
your
“super-ego”
speaks
with
authority
—
“take
your
elbows
off
the
table
!

”
These
are
the
very
basics
of
Freud
structure
of
the
mind
.


Our
ego
balances
the
primal
drives
of
the
id
with
the
voice
of
authority
from
the
super-ego
.



Where
does
the
conscience
come
in
?


For
Freud
the
conscience
is
the
form
that
the
super-ego
takes
in
addressing
the
ego
.


When
the
internalized
authority
derived
from
parental
(social/religious)
rules
and
regulations
controls
the
ego
is
it
is
understood
as
“the
conscience”
.


In
our
last
example
it
is
our
“conscience”
that
tells
us
to
remove
our
elbows
from
the
table
.



Notice
then
that
our
conscience
often
requires
certain
things
from
us
which
we
fail
to
achieve
and
this
gives
rise
to
guilt
.


For
Freud
,
the
conscience
can
be
thought
of
as
synonymous
with
the
“guilty
conscience”
.


Our
ego
is
punished
through
guilt
by
the
form
of
the
super-ego
we
call
conscience
.


Furthermore
,
Freud
says
that
when
the
super-ego
fails
to
deal
properly
with
the
id
—
when
the
pleasure
principle
is
repressed
—
this
forms
what
he
calls
neurosis
.



You
can
also
hopefully
see
the
differences
between
Aquinas
and
Freud
.


First
,
the
obvious
point
is
that
for
Freud
the
conscience
is
not
the
voice
of
God
.


Second
,
unlike
Aquinas
,
Freud
thinks
that
the
conscience
could
be
bad
,
destructive
and
unhelpful
.


The
conscience
is
the
way
the
ego
experiences
the
authority
of
the
super-ego
.


But
the
super-ego
is
arrived
at
through
the
experiences
we
have
.


And
,
of
course
,
we
might
have
had
really
bad
experiences
growing
up
where
parents
are
stifling
,
overly
authoritarian
,
distant
,
cold
,
hard
,
violent
,
abusive
etc
.


In
these
sorts
of
cases
the
conscience
would
be
stifling
,
overly
authoritarian
,
distant
,
etc
.


This
means
that
although
Freud
does
not
think
we
can
,
or
should
,
get
rid
of
the
conscience
he
does
think
we
should
treat
it
with
a
healthy
dose
of
scepticism
and
hence
not
be
kowtowed
by
the
“guilt”
that
is
our
ego’s
punishment
for
falling
short
of
the
super-ego
;
conscience
is
the
product
of
our
often
non-ideal
upbringing
rather
than
a
divinely-inspired
force
for
good
.

Freud’s
Psychosexual
Development
Theory

Psychosexual
Development
Theory
is
a
theory
of
sexual
development
from
birth
to
death
.


Freud
was
the
first
thinker
to
look
at
the
entire
lifespan
in
terms
of
development
.


Freud
thought
that
as
we
develop
we
move
through
different
stages
.


At
each
stage
our
libido
(sex
drive)
is
focused
towards
different
things
.


If
we
fail
to
move
through
a
stage
completely
,
or
return
to
a
stage
,
then
problems
arise
and
we
might
become
fixated
with
the
area
associated
with
that
stage
.


This
can
be
a
serious
problem
for
our
relationships
and
could
be
an
underlying
cause
of
mental
illness
.



The
first
stage
is
the
oral
stage
from
birth
to
about
one
and
a
half
.


This
stage
is
where
babies
get
pleasure
through
putting
things
in
their
mouth
,
pleasure
in
biting
,
chewing
and
sucking
.


For
example
,
babies
soon
after
they
are
born
are
breastfeeding
and
as
the
baby
develops
they
navigate
and
explore
the
world
through
putting
things
in
their
mouth
.


Notice
that
during
this
phase
babies
are
very
dependent
on
others
.


According
to
Freud
at
this
stage
not
only
do
we
get
information
about
the
world
,
but
we
also
fulfil
the
id
.


Babies
who
can
bite
,
chew
and
such
as
much
as
they
want
are
being
guided
by
the
id
.


Freud
explains
behaviours
like
smoking
,
chewing
gum
,
overeating
,
with
failure
to
move
properly
through
this
stage
which
prevented
the
successful
development
of
the
id
.



The
next
stage
,
from
about
one
and
a
half
to
three
years
,
is
the
anal
stage
.


Here
pleasure
is
gained
through
controlling
going
to
the
toilet
.


This
stage
is
about
gaining
control
of
one’s
body
,
and
it
starts
with
controlling
the
bladder
and
bowels
(being
potty
trained)
.


It
is
around
this
time
that
the
ego
develops
.


This
control
of
their
bodies
is
a
source
of
pride
and
pleasure
for
children
.


Agents
who
fail
to
properly
move
through
this
stage
are
what
are
sometimes
called
“anally
retentive”
.


That
is
,
someone
who
is
overly
controlling
or
out
of
control
and
messy
,
because
—
according
to
Freud
—
they
do
not
want
to
let
go
of
their
waste
,
or
do
not
care
where
or
when
they
let
go
of
their
waste
.



The
next
phase
of
development
,
from
about
three
to
six
years
,
is
the
phallic
stage
in
which
a
child
discovers
one’s
genitals
,
and
importantly
that
they
are
different
in
men
and
women
.


This
stage
is
where
Freud
thinks
we
develop
the
Oedipus
and
the
Electra
complex
.


A
problematic
phallic
stage
will
cause
problems
with
intimacy
in
later
life
.



The
next
stage
,
the
latency
stage
,
is
from
six
years
to
the
onset
of
puberty
.


This
stage
is
not
about
pleasure
in
the
body
as
the
libido
is
“latent”
or
hidden
—
this
is
the
stage
where
sexual
desire
is
repressed
and
no
new
sexual
desires
emerge
.


At
this
stage
girls
play
with
girls
in
order
to
learn
the
role
of
a
girl
and
boys
play
with
boys
in
order
to
learn
about
the
role
of
boys
.


.


The
child
learns
how
to
navigate
the
social
world
.


A
difficult
latency
stage
leads
to
relational
problems
and
understanding
one’s
gender
.



The
libido
then
reappears
in
the
final
stage
which
lasts
to
our
death
and
which
Freud
calls
the
mature
genital
stage
.


This
is
where
the
individual
not
only
recognises
the
difference
between
men
and
women
but
also
shows
a
desire
to
engage
in
a
sexual
relationship
and
,
more
generally
,
a
pursuit
of
pleasure
and
happiness
.


People
become
sexually
active
,
fall
in
love
and
get
married
.


This
is
the
stage
where
we
acquire
a
fully
developed
conscience
.



SUMMARY

The
notion
of
“conscience”
has
appeared
for
thousands
of
years
in
different
cultures
,
even
though
it
has
not
always
been
called
“conscience”
.


Modern
Christian
orthodoxy
popularised
it
and
characterised
it
in
relation
to
God’s
voice
,
and
guidance
.


Aquinas
thought
that
conscience
is
the
way
we
understand
how
to
apply
what
we
know
.


In
Aquinas’s
view
,
our
conscience
is
fallible
and
might
guide
us
wrongly
.


When
our
conscience
“gets
it
wrong”
we
can
be
either
culpable
—
through
vincible
ignorance
—
or
not
culpable
—
through
invincible
ignorance
.



Freud
is
less
convinced
that
conscience
is
a
force
for
good
,
and
he
is
certain
that
it
has
not
got
anything
to
do
with
God
.


For
Freud
conscience
can
be
either
a
good
or
bad
.


We
can
think
of
our
mind
as
having
three
parts
,
the
id
,
ego
and
super-ego
.


The
conscience
for
Freud
is
the
form
the
super-ego
takes
when
it
is
trying
to
keep
the
ego
in
line
.


It
is
internalized
as
the
voice
of
authority
.


The
super-ego
is
about
following
rules
but
those
rules
do
not
come
from
“on
high”
,
they
derive
from
the
upbringing
we
have
had
.


So
if
we
have
had
a
repressive
upbringing
then
the
super-ego
—
the
voice
of
conscience
—
will
be
repressive
.


How
we
develop
these
three
features
of
the
mind
is
through
what
Freud
calls
Psychosexual
Development
;
if
we
do
not
develop
correctly
then
we
become
fixated
and
repressive
,
form
a
neurosis
and
ultimately
become
mentally
ill
.


Freud
thought
that
this
could
be
avoided
by
working
through
the
Psychosexual
Stages
in
the
normal
way
,
and
can
be
treated
through
psychosexual
counselling
.

conscience
is
new
