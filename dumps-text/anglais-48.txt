What is Freedom of Conscience?

   Whether they’re happening inside the Church or out in the public
   square, debates about how far freedom of conscience extends can be
   confusing. Should Christians be compelled to take a vaccine that’s been
   tested on the fetal remains of an aborted child? Should Christian
   business owners have a right to refuse a service that would violate
   their conscience, like baking a wedding cake for a same-sex ceremony?
   How do Christians respond to government mandates or policies that they
   cannot follow in good conscience? And how do we deal with conscientious
   disagreement within the Church?

   The specifics of freedom of conscience can be complex and nuanced and
   are often misunderstood. Abraham Kuyper called the conscience:

   “the shield of the human person, the root of civil liberties, the
   source of a nation’s happiness.”

   Why is it so important? To answer that question, let’s begin by looking
   at what the conscience is and is not.

What is “conscience”?

   Definitions of conscience vary, but they center around the idea of what
   someone believes to be right and wrong. The conscience is a moral
   compass that helps direct people’s actions. In that sense, conscience
   is personal and subjective because it condemns or excuses one’s own
   conduct, not that of another person – after all, you don’t get a guilty
   conscience because of someone else’s behavior.

   However, conscience is also based on an objective and general standard.
   The Bible explains that the conscience is given by God to both
   Christians and non-Christians and it helps people apply their knowledge
   of right and wrong to their behavior, both past actions and decisions
   about future actions. The New Testament also speaks of the importance
   of having a good conscience by following its direction and doing what
   is right (see Rom. 2:15, 1 Tim. 1:5).

   Christian political scientist David Koyzis, in his book We Answer to
   Another, tells a story about the Milgram Experiment which relates well
   to conscience. The experiment was a study designed to look at how
   people respond to authority. The experimenter would select two
   participants and assign one the role of teacher, while another
   volunteer would be given the role of student. The person selected as
   the teacher was instructed to apply an electrical shock of increasing
   voltage to the other person – the student – who was in a different
   room. Now, unbeknownst to the teacher, the other person was actually an
   actor being paid to play the part. Although the teacher could hear the
   apparent pain experienced by the person in the next room, most
   individuals would continue applying electric shocks – despite
   increasing screams and pleas to stop – when instructed to do so by the
   experimenter. However, two participants were unwilling to keep going
   along with the instructions. Both were Christians. They followed the
   experiment instructor’s commands for a time but stopped sooner than
   most other participants, knowing that they were responsible for their
   actions and stating that they were answerable to a higher authority.

   When asked to do something wrong, we too are responsible for our
   actions and answerable to a higher authority.

   Ultimately, the foundation for freedom of conscience is found in the
   sovereignty of God. Every human being has various authorities in their
   lives, such as parents, employers, church leadership, or civil
   government. Each of these has legitimate authority over us, but that
   authority is also limited. The only One who is sovereign over the
   conscience is God, and if another authority commands us to do what we
   believe is sin – what we believe violates how God wants us to act –
   then we can appeal to freedom of conscience. The conscience is a shield
   that protects against the abuse of authority and points instead to the
   one Higher Authority.

Conscience and the public square

   Debates around conscience are becoming increasingly relevant in our
   society and are most noticeable within certain vocations. Can medical
   professionals refuse to help a patient access abortion, assisted
   suicide, or sex-change surgery? Can marriage officiants refuse to marry
   a same-sex couple? Can a photographer decline a request to take photos
   at a same-sex ceremony? Can a publisher decline to print pro-abortion
   pamphlets?

   Increasingly, our society answers “no.” To allow people to
   conscientiously object is seen as simply discriminatory and bigoted.
   Our society needs to understand that a conscientious objection in these
   cases is not a rejection of an individual person, but a refusal to
   commit what the objector believes to be a sin or to participate in
   sinful activity.

   Today it’s often Christians who are being pressured to violate their
   conscience. However, there are others who seek the same protections for
   their conscience. It’s this freedom that an atheist doctor appeals to
   when he determines he cannot participate in euthanasia, based on his
   oath to do no harm. And what of the fashion designers, back in 2016,
   who had principled objections to designing an inauguration dress for
   First Lady Melania Trump? When these designers announced they would not
   make the dress because they didn’t want to be associated with newly
   elected President Donald Trump’s administration, many celebrated their
   decision as taking a principled stand. Likewise, some in our society
   want abortion-supporting publishers to be allowed to decline print
   orders for pro-life material, or for a gay business owner to be allowed
   to refuse to rent a hall for an event that promotes biblical marriage.

   Yet increasingly, the same people want to see Christians reprimanded
   for acting according to their beliefs.

   For Christians, the answer to the questions above might be easy. But we
   have our own disputes about conscience within the Church as well, such
   as what kind of entertainment is permissible or what it looks like to
   honor the Sabbath Day outside of corporate worship.

When conscience pricks

   Of note, the strongest commands of conscience are often negative, in
   terms of what you are not permitted to do, rather than what you may or
   must do. For example, if you use foul language, your conscience will
   likely bother you more than if you fail to correct someone else using
   such language. Or, if a publisher prints pro-abortion pamphlets that he
   objects to, his conscience will make him feel guilty more than if he
   fails to promote life as he believes he ought.

   When the conscience commands a person not to do something, the command
   is about a very specific action. Alternatively, if the command is
   instead to act on something good, there are often various ways of
   pursuing that good.

Conscience and the Church

   Because of sin, no person’s conscience is perfectly aligned with what
   God commands in His Word. The chart below is based on one from a
   helpful book titled Conscience: What It Is, How To Train It, and Loving
   Those Who Differ, by Andrew Naselli and J.D. Crowley. The authors used
   it to explain the difference between two people’s consciences, and how
   they compare to God’s will. The letters within the chart refer to
   different rules or principles of right and wrong.

   Both Arnold and Zoey have added rules to their conscience that are not
   commanded in Scripture. For example, perhaps Arnold has a history of
   alcohol abuse in his family, so he adds letter ‘C’ which commands him
   not to drink alcohol to avoid temptation. Maybe letters ‘D’ and ‘E’ are
   Arnold’s belief that he must not play cards or any games involving
   dice. Arnold and Zoey have also both failed to include letter ‘B’ in
   their conscience. Perhaps this is a failure to consistently honor the
   Sabbath Day, and their consciences no longer accuse them for it.
   However, Arnold and Zoey’s consciences are both aligned with God’s will
   in letters ‘J’ through ‘M,’ where they have rightly applied biblical
   principles and commands to their lives and consciences. The natural
   tendency is to think that if another person has more rules than us,
   they are legalistic. Alternatively, if they have fewer rules, they are
   failing to live as Christians. However, Scripture remains the standard
   to which we must seek to align our conscience.

   The conscience can easily become oversensitive by including rules that
   are not matters of right and wrong. We see examples of the Pharisees in
   the New Testament who created additional rules for the Sabbath and
   wanted everyone to abide by them. We might feel unnecessarily guilty if
   we do not abide by similar rules on the Sabbath.

   Alternatively, conscience can become desensitized. Perhaps you use or
   tolerate foul language that would have shocked you a decade ago, or you
   consume entertainment that you would have been ashamed of years
   earlier. Our conscience does not always accurately tell us what is sin
   and what is not. While it might not always make sense to follow
   conscience in relation to other authorities, we have a duty to obey it
   because we cannot commit what we believe is sin.

   At the same time, we should be careful when dealing with the
   consciences of other people. In 1 Corinthians 8, the Apostle Paul talks
   about whether believers can eat meat offered to idols and refers to
   consideration for brothers and sisters with a weaker conscience. So, if
   we believe a brother or sister has a weaker conscience, we must not be
   a stumbling block to them and cause them to disobey their conscience.
   On disputable issues, we may realize that someone has a weaker
   conscience, and we can discuss the biblical principles that apply. Or
   perhaps they have a stronger conscience, and they can help us
   understand where our conscience is not aligned to Scripture.

   Again, conscience is not meant to be some wishy-washy idea where
   everyone can believe what they want, like in the time of the judges of
   Israel, when “everyone did what was right in his own eyes.” There are
   direct, objective commands and principles that can be taken from
   Scripture. There are many issues which should not be disputable for
   Christians and are clear in the Bible.

   However, there are also issues where serious Christians can come to
   different conclusions about what God commands. For example, what
   activities are not permitted on the Sabbath? Or perhaps more current,
   how do we navigate government restrictions and the call to honor our
   authorities versus our callings to obey what God demands of us? What
   about masking, vaccines, etc., both within the public square and the
   Church? Christian conscience differs on these issues, and believers can
   have biblical arguments for why they think God commands or prohibits
   different actions.

What isn’t conscience?

   Some of us might react to the idea that conscience is a kind of
   subjective belief that is not accountable to other people. We can’t
   simply say, “well, what’s right for you isn’t necessarily right for
   me.” Conscience is not merely a personal preference like your favorite
   food or music. It is also not license to do whatever you please and
   ignore other authorities. Rather, freedom of conscience refers to moral
   beliefs that respect a limited sphere of individual authority while
   still recognizing other legitimate authorities that can impose
   obligations on us.

   As such, the conscience is not unlimited. Some people might abuse the
   ability to claim conscientious objection out of self-interest or to
   simply justify their actions. Authorities such as the civil government,
   church government, employers, or parents do have power to compel or
   deny certain actions.

   However, if the civil government (or other authorities) limits
   conscience, they must provide good justification for doing so and seek
   to accommodate conscientious objectors as much as they are able, such
   as through exemptions for freedom of conscience. Abraham Kuyper again
   shows the importance of conscience, stating that:

   “Ten times better is a state in which a few eccentrics can make
   themselves a laughingstock for a time by abusing freedom of conscience,
   than a state in which these eccentricities are prevented by violating
   conscience itself.”

Conclusion

   Ultimately, conscience belongs to an individual and is accountable to
   God. However, it should also be rooted in Biblical commands and
   principles. Increasingly, we encounter disagreements in the Church
   about various issues, while in the public square some Christians’ jobs
   are threatened because the State fails to recognize conscience. On many
   matters, Christians will refuse to do something they believe is evil
   even if others do not believe the action is wrong. The Church has an
   opportunity to continue to show our society what it means to live
   according to moral standards based on the will and Sovereignty of God.
   Wherever we find ourselves, let’s seek to say, “I myself always strive
   to have a conscience without offense toward God and men” (Acts 24:16).

Human Rights

Should Christians be free to obey our conscience?

   In recent years there’s been a worrying downward trend for religious
   freedom in both Canada and the United States. Examples abound of
   Christian T-shirt printers, bakers, photographers, print-shop owners,
   wedding dress makers, florists and caterers who are being forced –
   through human rights commissions, or through lawsuits – to participate
   in same-sex weddings in violation of these various business peoples'
   consciences. Each of these Christian business people said they would
   bake, cater, arrange flowers, print invitations, take photos, print
   T-shirts, etc. for a gay person's birthday or retirement party or any
   other celebration – they just wouldn’t do it for a same-sex wedding
   (the only exception was the wedding dress maker, for obvious reasons).
   This means the objection is not about discriminating against gay
   people. It never was. It's very specifically about endorsing a
   definition of marriage or a specific act that fundamentally violates
   God's design for marriage. Stand up for others I know of Christians who
   can, with a clean conscience, bake, photograph, etc. a gay wedding. And
   I know some who can't (see 1 Cor. 8). This is a legitimate discussion
   to have between Christians. The much bigger question is: should the
   State force the latter group to do as the former? If you are a
   Christian and you advocate that the State is justified in making
   Christians participate, in any way, in a gay marriage, I believe you've
   ripped the rug from under yourself – if it is fine for the State to
   violate other Christians’ consciences this time, what's to prevent them
   from violating yours next? If a Christian photographer has to shoot a
   gay wedding, does a church have to rent their hall for a gay wedding?
   (This happened in British Columbia in 2005). Or must an organist play
   for a gay marriage ceremony? Or will a Christian marriage commissioner
   be forced to officiate for such a celebration? (In Saskatchewan and
   Manitoba, this is the case). Negative implications of the bill for
   Christians Does this mean that I’m ready to let the State allow the
   same kind of discrimination against Christians? If an atheist decides
   he doesn't want to take photos of a Christian wedding, am I okay with
   that? Well, the State can't force all citizens to embrace, encourage
   and support the Christian faith, because that wouldn't be freedom of
   religion, would it? Freedom of religion is freedom from the State, and
   not from fellow citizens. Your Charter rights protect you from the
   busybody government interfering in your religious practices and
   beliefs. They are not meant to make the government interfere in your
   personal or professional relationships in order to promote, oppose or
   defend your religion. So, to be clear and consistent, I do expect and
   accept being shunned by others because of my Christian beliefs. (Christ
   predicted it, didn't he?) I would not expect the State to go to bat for
   me if a gay bookstore refused to sell my book on a Biblical
   understanding of gay-marriage, or if an Islamic school refused to hire
   me as a janitor. If I wanted to publish a Christian defense of capital
   punishment, I wouldn't expect the State to force a Mennonite printer to
   publish it for me. With liberty comes responsibility. That includes
   responsibility to go find another printer, or baker or candlestick
   maker. André Schutten is the General Legal Counsel, and Director of Law
