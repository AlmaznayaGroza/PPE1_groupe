editorial

consciousness

by rick lewis

it gives me particular pleasure to introduce an issue focussing on
consciousness as i myself am sometimes conscious

 i know the same goes
for many of you

 but there is a great deal of debate among philosophers
about what this actually means



the nature of consciousness is a philosophical problem which has come to
centre stage mainly in the last few years

 as the neuroscientists have
gradually found out more and more about the workings of the brain
philosophers have wondered whether any part of the mind is inaccessible
to scientific investigation

 many have argued that even if we find out
everything about the way the brain physically functions there will
still be something vital missing from our picture

 what this is of
course is an understanding of how our subjective experiences come
about

 this is what david chalmers calls the hard problem of
consciousness



in this issue we have articles looking at this problem from a wide
variety of viewpoints

 in the first of them mary midgley says that many
people talk about consciousness as if the brain was in isolation

 she
says we need to step back and see consciousness in its wider context
which is the context of organic life



if conscious life had to be organic this would rule out the possibility
of conscious machines

 professor igor aleksander see interview is an
expert on artificial intelligence

 he at least thinks that it is
possible to build robots which are conscious of their surroundings in a
sense broadly similar to the sense in which we say that humans are aware
of their surroundings

 he aims to prove this by actually building one
and has already made some progress in that direction



there is a huge contrast between igor aleksander s view and that of the
french philosopher henri bergson 18591941

 bergson was a towering
figure in french philosophy in the early 20th century – the jacques
derrida of his day

 however he has gone into a profound eclipse


reading johnfrancis phipps article about him it isn t hard to see why
– there can be few philosophers less in tune with the intellectual
spirit of the early 21st century than our henri

 still for that very
reason his ideas on consciousness give a completely different
perspective on the subject from that to which we re now accustomed



some people approach the problem by pointing out that consciousness is
always consciousness of something

 i was conscious of the gathering
clouds

 you were conscious of the rain falling on your face

 so they
say consciousness is always directed towards something

 it has
 aboutness or in philojargon intentionality

 this isn t the only way
we talk about consciousness in everyday speech however

 as jeanne
warren points out in her article on john macmurray we also use it to
mean the opposite of unconsciousness – of being asleep or in a coma


there isn t necessarily any huge divergence of meaning here as when we
say “has fred regained consciousness

” we might be asking whether he has
become aware again of all the various things and people around him



though the theme of this issue is consciousness a second unanticipated
theme seems to have crept in as well

 with articles on henri bergson
john macmurray and john herschel we have pieces on three thinkers who
are regarded by some as being unjustly neglected

 bergson and herschel
were acclaimed as giants in their own day

 macmurray wasn t but has
gradually gathered admirers in the years since his demise



from one of the most conceptually difficult problems of philosophy we
turn to one of the most practically worrying ethical issue of today

 the
headlines have been filled recently by the misdeeds of soldiers
stationed in iraq – the torture of prisoners the deaths of civilians


in the first article in this issue philosophy graduate douglas
gearhart who served as a psyops psychological operations specialist
in iraq appeals to philosophers to develop practical moral guidance and
moral training for soldiers in battlefield situations

 scholastic
philosophers like thomas aquinas called this aspect of just war theory
jus in bello

 if gearhart is right it should cease being seen as a
quaint relic of medieval thought and instead become the urgent concern
of ethicists everywhere

 in a way this is also about consciousness as
the choices soldiers make in wars are conscious choices but ones made
under enormous stress and without the steadying framework of everyday
civilian life

 how can they recall more easily in such situations a
conscious awareness of the dignity and fragility of human life
