   class consciousness, the self-understanding of members of a social
   class. This modern sociological concept has its origins in, and is
   closely associated with, Marxist theory.

   Although Karl Marx himself did not articulate a theory of class
   consciousness, he intimated the concept in his characterization of the
   working class. According to Marx, workers first become conscious of
   sharing common grievances against capitalists (thus forming a class “in
   itself”) and eventually develop an awareness of themselves as forming a
   social class opposed to the bourgeoisie (thus becoming a class “for
   itself”), the proletariat. Class consciousness is a historical
   phenomenon, born out of collective struggle. In this sense, Marx did
   not approach class consciousness as a matter of pure ideality.
   Rejecting any separation of theory and practice, he used the term
   “conscious human practices” to emphasize the conjunction of
   subjectivity and objectivity in history.

   In his seminal study of class consciousness, the Hungarian Marxist
   philosopher György Lukács stressed the need to distinguish between
   class consciousness and the ideas or feelings actually held by the
   members of a social class. An objective analysis of class
   consciousness, according to Lukács, must take into account those
   thoughts and feelings but also those that the members would have held
   were they able to acquire a true picture of their situation and of
   society as a whole.

   Because Marxism considers social classes to have objective identities
   and interests, its conception of class consciousness includes the
   possibility of its antithesis: false consciousness. Broadly defined,
   false consciousness refers to a distorted understanding of one’s class
   identity and interest. From the perspective of Marxism, it concerns
   primarily the tension between the historical mission of the working
   class (to destroy capitalism and realize the socialist revolution) and
   its understanding thereof. The problem of false consciousness has
   encouraged an elitist streak in Marxism.

   Although false consciousness is an error, it is not baseless or purely
   fictitious. It is itself historically determined. For Marx, capitalism
   is in a perpetual and eventually fatal state of crisis. Capitalism
   unleashes forces of production that come to undermine its own
   sustainability. For example, capital accumulation leads to increasing
   economic inequalities, which reduces the purchasing power of workers
   and in turn diminishes profit. Lukács suggested that the bourgeoisie
   cannot face that crisis, because to do so would require accepting the
   end of the class structure and relinquishing their class privilege. In
   that sense, the economic and political ideology of the bourgeoisie is a
   form of false consciousness, but it is nonetheless objectively
   determined by the historical position of that class.

   After Marx, socialist thinkers diverged on the status of working-class
   consciousness. Some were optimistic and considered the working class to
   be naturally in tune with its class interest and spontaneously
   revolutionary; others, like Lenin, argued that the working class did
   not possess instinctual socialist tendencies and therefore needed to be
   enlightened by a revolutionary vanguard.

   In a seminal redefinition, the sociologist Michael Mann examined
   different dimensions of class consciousness: class belonging and
   identity, class antagonism, class totality (the idea that social
   classes encompass the entirety of society), and the vision of a
   classless society. Those dimensions not only are formal subcategories
   but correspond to experiences that generate class awareness and class
   solidarity. For instance, the experience of economic exploitation can
   lead workers to recognize that they have a stake in each other’s
   well-being, and from there they will develop class consciousness and
   class solidarity. Mann’s focus was placed on consciousness itself and
   thus departed to some extent from Marx’s attempt to embed consciousness
   in social practices.

   Despite its Marxist origin, the concept of class consciousness is not
   necessarily predicated on a revolutionary view of history. The
   sociologist Karl Mannheim, for instance, associated social classes with
   distinct understandings of reality without presuming one to be more
   valid than others. Mannheim believed that social class frames one’s
   understanding of reality, whether one is a member of the working class
   or part of the elite. The result is a more or less partial and
   distorted understanding, necessarily skewed by interest. Mannheim thus
   identified class consciousness with ideological alienation. Therefore,
   the solution lies not in greater class solidarity but, on the contrary,
   in acquiring a more-enlightened understanding by approaching reality
   from a multiplicity of perspectives. It is important to note that Marx
   and Mannheim did not consider all forms of knowledge to be equally
   affected by class consciousness; they regarded mathematics and science
   to be free of its influence.

   The concept of class consciousness receded in public discourse with the
   fall of communist regimes at the end of the 20th century. Nevertheless,
   the idea continues to raise important sociological questions, such as
   these: What is the relationship between economic condition and
   subjectivity? What is the role of the intelligentsia in bringing about
   political change? Are there collective forms of consciousness and, if
   so, what is their political efficacy?
