Phenomenon
of
group
members
advocating
shared
interests

Group
consciousness
in
political
science
refers
to
the
phenomenon
in
which
members
within
a
social
identity
group
become
aware
of
how
their
group
identification
impacts
their
position
in
society
,
and
therefore
come
together
to
pursue
collective
action
to
advocate
for
their
shared
interests
.

^([1][2])
Group
consciousness
requires
two
necessary
preconditions
:
group
membership
,
and
group
identification
.

^([1])
Group
membership
is
the

'
objective
'

belonging
within
the
group
,
while
identification
refers
to
the
subjective
psychological
importance
of
the
group
to
the
member
.

^([1])
Group
consciousness
has
been
studied
,
for
example
,
among
women
,^([3])
Hispanic
and
Latino
Americans
,^([4])
and
Muslim
Americans
.

The
intent
behind
group
consciousness

[edit]

Group
consciousness
is
not
automatically
assumed
to
exist
with
any
organization
of
people
.


However
,
group
consciousness
often
stems
from
the
existence
of
group
agents
.


These
organizations
bring
people
together
through
common
purposes
and
intentions
that
they
act
upon
.


Some
examples
of
group
agents
include
courts
,
corporations
,
NGOs
,
and
other
collectives
of
individuals
.

^([6])
Group
consciousness
requires
unity
through
the
group
'
s
belief
in
a
set
of
"ideological
beliefs
about
one
'
s
group
'
s
social
standing
.

"
Groups
also
take
on
the
view
that
to
improve
their
social
standing
and
best
reach
their
goals
,
the
best
policy
is
to
pursue
collective
action
.

^([7])

Beyond
formal
organizations
like
corporations
and
nonprofits
,
group
consciousness
is
often
linked
to
socially
stratified
groups
,
including
class
,
gender
,
race
,
etc
.


When
discussing
racial
consciousness
specifically
,
group
consciousness
emerges
from
the
notion
that
people
'
s
identities
are
inseparable
from
their
race
.


As
a
result
,
minority
groups
,
particularly
oppressed
minority
groups
,
band
together
to
find
a
source
of
communal
support
.


In
America
specifically
,
African-Americans
specifically
have
been
historically
treated
as
part
of
a
racial
group
,
instead
of
recognized
for
their
individual
identities
.


Researchers
have
therefore
connected
this
idea
of
"linked
fate
,"
meaning
the
viewpoint
that
one
'
s
fate
is
"inextricably
linked
to
the
fate
of
their
racial
group"
to
a
heightened
sense
of
group
consciousness
.

^([7])

Current
debate
regarding
group
consciousness
qualifications

[edit]

One
key
point
of
contention
within
the
philosophy
is
whether
or
not
the
“consciousness”
of
a
group
can
be
phenomenal
,
meaning
experiential
,
or
if
it
is
purely
a
sense
of
awareness
.

^([6][8])
The
argument
has
been
made
that
entire
states
can
be
“phenomenally
conscious
,”
meaning
they
can
subjectively
experience
perceptions
and
sensations
as
one
entity
.


In
his
paper
“If
Materialism
is
True
,
the
United
States
is
Probably
Conscious
,”
philosopher
Eric
Schwitzgebel
argues
that
the
United
States
experiences
a
consciousness
that
overrides
individual
citizens
.


Schwitzgebel
posits
that
through
using
materialist
philosophy
,
it
may
be
argued
that
the
United
States
has
the
characteristics
also
present
in
what
materialists
consider
to
be
“conscious
beings
.

”
In
this
case
,
we
can
take
materialism
to
mean
the
belief
that
solely
matter
,
rather
than
the
mind
or
ideas
,
can
be
treated
as
real
objects
.


In
the
context
of
group
consciousness
,
this
refers
to
the
controversial
debate
over
whether
a
group
can
function
as
its
own
being
,
or
if
group
consciousness
is
primarily
a
metaphor
.


Schwitzgebel
believes
in
the
former
.


He
states
that
the
US
is
self-preserving
,
goal-oriented
,
and
can
respond
intelligently
to
threats
and
opportunities
.


The
US
functions
as
an
individual
entity
.


Thus
,
the
United
States
can
be
said
to
have
a
concrete
identity
through
Schwitzgebel
'
s
interpretation
of
group
consciousness
.

^([8])

However
,
philosophers
like
Christian
List
also
posit
that
group
agents
are
not
necessarily
phenomenally
conscious
.


Within
his
paper
,
"What
Is
It
Like
to
Be
a
Group
Agent
?

"
he
argues
that
there
is
an
important
distinction
that
must
be
made
between
consciousness
as
awareness
and
as
experience
.


List
posits
that
group
agents
are
able
to
have
consciousness
as
awareness
.


A
group
agent
may
share
beliefs
and
act
on
then
,
but
it
is
the
individuals
in
this
group
,
who
are
aware
of
their
shared
identity
,
who
are
performing
the
action
.


Group
consciousness
thus
doesn
'
t
mean
that
a
group
can
act
as
a
true
collective
singular
;
it
only
facilitates
collective
action
.

^([6])

Group
consciousness
within
feminism

[edit]

Feminist
consciousness
is
defined
as
"politicized
gender
identification
,"
which
is
when
women
link
their
gender
identity
and
the
societal
issues
that
arise
alongside
it
with
a
set
of
political
beliefs
.


Based
on
research
regarding
women
'
s
rights
activism
,
personality
and
life
experiences
can
be
seen
as
factors
that
lead
to
feminist
consciousness
.


For
instance
,
women
who
are
more
politically
engaged
tend
to
embrace
feminism
and
feminist
activism
than
women
who
are
not
.


In
addition
,
women
with
intersectional
identities
,
meaning
women
who
identify
with
more
than
one
marginalized
female
identity
,
are
also
more
likely
to
be
very
aware
of
their
group
membership
and
thus
develop
group
consciousness
.


For
example
,
lesbians
experience
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sexual
orientation
and
gender
;
they
are
therefore
more
likely
to
be
aware
of
their
oppression
and
seek
solace
in
group
solidarity
.

^([9])
Viewing
feminism
as
a
case
study
for
group
consciousness
demonstrates
how
even
within
collective
action
entities
,
there
are
outside
factors
that
influence
the
extent
to
which
members
are
willing
to
participate
.
