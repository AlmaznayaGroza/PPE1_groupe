phenomenon of group members advocating shared interests

group consciousness in political science refers to the phenomenon in
which members within a social identity group become aware of how their
group identification impacts their position in society and therefore
come together to pursue collective action to advocate for their shared
interests

12 group consciousness requires two necessary
preconditions group membership and group identification

1 group
membership is the objective belonging within the group while
identification refers to the subjective psychological importance of the
group to the member

1 group consciousness has been studied for
example among women3 hispanic and latino americans4 and
muslim americans

the intent behind group consciousness

edit

group consciousness is not automatically assumed to exist with any
organization of people

 however group consciousness often stems from
the existence of group agents

 these organizations bring people together
through common purposes and intentions that they act upon

 some examples
of group agents include courts corporations ngos and other
collectives of individuals

6 group consciousness requires unity
through the group s belief in a set of ideological beliefs about one s
group s social standing

 groups also take on the view that to improve
their social standing and best reach their goals the best policy is to
pursue collective action

7

beyond formal organizations like corporations and nonprofits group
consciousness is often linked to socially stratified groups including
class gender race etc

 when discussing racial consciousness
specifically group consciousness emerges from the notion that people s
identities are inseparable from their race

 as a result minority
groups particularly oppressed minority groups band together to find a
source of communal support

 in america specifically africanamericans
specifically have been historically treated as part of a racial group
instead of recognized for their individual identities

 researchers have
therefore connected this idea of linked fate meaning the viewpoint
that one s fate is inextricably linked to the fate of their racial
group to a heightened sense of group consciousness

7

current debate regarding group consciousness qualifications

edit

one key point of contention within the philosophy is whether or not the
“consciousness” of a group can be phenomenal meaning experiential or
if it is purely a sense of awareness

68 the argument has been
made that entire states can be “phenomenally conscious” meaning they
can subjectively experience perceptions and sensations as one entity

 in
his paper “if materialism is true the united states is probably
conscious” philosopher eric schwitzgebel argues that the united states
experiences a consciousness that overrides individual citizens


schwitzgebel posits that through using materialist philosophy it may be
argued that the united states has the characteristics also present in
what materialists consider to be “conscious beings

” in this case we
can take materialism to mean the belief that solely matter rather than
the mind or ideas can be treated as real objects

 in the context of
group consciousness this refers to the controversial debate over
whether a group can function as its own being or if group consciousness
is primarily a metaphor

 schwitzgebel believes in the former

 he states
that the us is selfpreserving goaloriented and can respond
intelligently to threats and opportunities

 the us functions as an
individual entity

 thus the united states can be said to have a
concrete identity through schwitzgebel s interpretation of group
consciousness

8

however philosophers like christian list also posit that group agents
are not necessarily phenomenally conscious

 within his paper what is
it like to be a group agent

 he argues that there is an important
distinction that must be made between consciousness as awareness and as
experience

 list posits that group agents are able to have consciousness
as awareness

 a group agent may share beliefs and act on then but it is
the individuals in this group who are aware of their shared identity
who are performing the action

 group consciousness thus doesn t mean
that a group can act as a true collective singular it only facilitates
collective action

6

group consciousness within feminism

edit

feminist consciousness is defined as politicized gender
identification which is when women link their gender identity and the
societal issues that arise alongside it with a set of political beliefs


based on research regarding women s rights activism personality and
life experiences can be seen as factors that lead to feminist
consciousness

 for instance women who are more politically engaged tend
to embrace feminism and feminist activism than women who are not

 in
addition women with intersectional identities meaning women who
identify with more than one marginalized female identity are also more
likely to be very aware of their group membership and thus develop group
consciousness

 for example lesbians experience discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation and gender they are therefore more likely
to be aware of their oppression and seek solace in group
solidarity

9 viewing feminism as a case study for group
consciousness demonstrates how even within collective action entities
there are outside factors that influence the extent to which members are
willing to participate
