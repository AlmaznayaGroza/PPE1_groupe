from wikipedia the free encyclopedia

this article is about the conscience clause in medicine

 for the
conscience clause in the 19th century english educational system see
conscience clause education



conscience clauses are legal clauses attached to laws in some parts of
the united states and other countries which permit pharmacists
physicians andor other providers of health care not to provide certain
medical services for reasons of religion or conscience

 it can also
involve parents withholding consenting for particular treatments for
their children

1

in many cases the clauses also permit health care providers to refuse
to refer patients to unopposed providers

 those who choose not to refer
or provide services may not be disciplined or discriminated against

 the
provision is most frequently enacted in connection with issues relating
to reproduction such as abortion see conscientious objection to
abortion sterilization contraception and stem cell based treatments
but may include any phase of patient care

history

edit



inside drawer to senator frank church s did senate desk

the earliest national conscience clause law in the united states which
was enacted immediately following the supreme court s decision in roe v


wade applied only to abortion and sterilization

 it was sponsored by
senator frank church of idaho

3 the church amendment of 1973
passed by the senate on a vote of 92–1 exempted private hospitals
receiving federal funds under the hillburton act medicare and medicaid
from any requirement to provide abortions or sterilizations when they
objected on “the basis of religious beliefs or moral convictions

”
nearly every state enacted similar legislation by the end of the
decade—often with the support of legislators who otherwise supported
abortion rights

 supreme court justice harry blackmun the author of the
roe v

 wade majority opinion endorsed such clauses “appropriate
protection” for individual physicians and denominational
hospitals

4

according to nancy berlinger of the bioethics research institute the
hastings center 





conscientious objection in health care always has a
social dimension and 





laws and professional guidelines on
conscientious objection in health care must balance the respect for an
individual s beliefs against the wellbeing of the general
public

1

conscience clauses have been adopted by a number of u

s

 states


including arkansas illinois indiana iowa kansas kentucky
louisiana maine maryland massachusetts michigan mississippi
pennsylvania and south dakota

 there are some recent comprehensive
reviews of federal and state conscience clause laws across the united
states and in select other countries

5

some clauses address local concerns oregon recognizes a physician s
right to refuse to participate in physicianassisted suicide although
it is legal in that state

1

informed consent

edit

an informed consent clause although allowing medical professionals not
to perform procedures against their conscience does not allow
professionals to give fraudulent information to deter a patient from
obtaining such a procedure such as lying about the risks involved in an
abortion to deter one from obtaining one in order to impose one s
belief using deception

 these principles were reaffirmed in the utah
supreme court s decision in wood v

 university of utah medical center
2002

6 commenting on the case bioethicist jacob appel of new
york university wrote that if only a small number of physicians
intentionally or negligently withhold information from their patients
significant damage is done to the medical profession as a whole because
pregnant women will no longer know whether to trust their
doctors

7

right of conscience rule

edit

the right of conscience rule was a set of protections for healthcare
workers enacted by president george w

 bush on december 18 2008
allowing healthcare workers to refuse care based on their personal
beliefs

8 specifically the rule denied federal funding to
institutions that did not allow workers to refuse care that went against
their beliefs

 in february 2011 president barack obama rescinded the
right of conscience rule

910

pharmacists

edit

states have historically provided a conscience clause right allowing
pharmacists to refrain from participating in abortions

11 in april
2005 governor rod blagojevich by emergency executive order required all
pharmacists to provide plan b levonorgestrel

 in september 2012 the
illinois appellate court found the governor s order violated illinois
law

12

in june 2006 the pharmacy board of the washington state department of
health rejected a draft rule proposed by governor christine gregoire to
require all pharmacies to begin carrying plan b

13 governor
gregoire responded by releasing a public statement warning the board
members to reconsider or they could be removed

13 in july 2006 the
washington state human rights commission warned the board members that
they would be personally liable for illegally discriminating against
women if they did not pass the governor s plan b rule

1314 in
april 2007 the board approved a final rule prohibiting pharmacies from
not stocking plan b for religious reasons but allowing exemptions for
“good faith” business reasons

13

when ralph s thriftway a grocery store in olympia washington refused
for religious reasons to carry plan b it was widely boycotted leading
gregoire to cancel the grocer s longstanding account with the washington
governor s mansion

13 the only complaints for violating the plan b
rule were filed against the grocer

13 half of washington s
hospitals are catholic

15 the grocer sued but instead of alleging
violations of the broader constitution of washington its attorneys at
the alliance defending freedom and the becket fund for religious liberty
only filed under the free exercise clause of the united states
constitution

16 the case is known as stormans inc

 v

 wiesman



on november 8 2007 u

s

 district judge ronald b

 leighton granted the
grocer a preliminary injunction blocking the rule

1713 on may 1
2008 united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit judges thomas
g

 nelson and jay bybee denied the state a stay of the injunction
pending appeal over a dissent by judge a

 wallace tashima

1813
however on july 8 2009 circuit judge kim mclane wardlaw joined by
richard clifton and n

 randy smith reversed the preliminary
injunction

1916

on february 22 2012 after four years of discovery and a twelveday
bench trial judge leighton issued a permanent injunction blocking the
plan b rule as unconstitutional

20 on july 23 2015 circuit judge
susan p

 graber joined by judges mary h

 murguia and richard clifton
reversed

2122 the grocer s petition for certiorari from the
supreme court of the united states was denied on june 28
2016

2324 justice samuel alito joined by chief justice john
roberts and justice clarence thomas dissented writing that “the rules
challenged here reflect antipathy towards religious beliefs that do not
accord with the views of those holding the levers of government
power

”2526

in 201427 and 201628 senator cory booker introduced the
“access to birth control act” bill which would require all pharmacists
in the united states to provide emergency contraception



responses

edit

health care providers opposed to abortion or contraception support the
clauses because they believe that disciplinary or legal action for
refusing to perform services obliges providers to supply services which
their moral or religious principles forbid



reproductive rights organizations such as planned parenthood and naral
prochoice america oppose the provision because they maintain that
pharmacists doctors and hospitals have a professional duty to fulfill
patients legal medical needs regardless of their own ethical stances


opponents see conscience clauses as an attempt to limit reproductive
rights in lieu of bans struck down by supreme court rulings such as roe
v

 wade

29 though the case has been overturned by dobbs v

 jackson
women s health organization



as a result the term conscience clause is controversial and primarily
used by those who support these provisions

 those who oppose them often
prefer to use the term refusal clause implying that those who
exercise the clauses are refusing to treat a patient



in 2018 roger severino the thendirector of the office for civil
rights at the united states department of health and human services
criticized those who oppose conscience clauses saying “there s a
movement that tries to squelch dissent on the question of abortion so
that those that stand up for life are being systematically driven out of
the medical profession

” he also stated that “nobody should be fired
from their position as a medical professional because they refuse to
participate in the taking of a human life in abortion

 it s illegal if
you receive federal funds

 you may expect an enforcement action from the
hhs office for civil rights if you do such a thing

”30

catholic doctrine

edit

the conscience clause is widely invoked in catholic universities
hospitals and agencies because the catholic church opposes abortion
contraceptives sterilization and embryonic stem cell treatments


opponents of related foca legislation have interpreted the possible end
of the conscience clause as a demand to either do abortions or
close

31 timothy dolan has said “in effect the president is
saying we have a year to figure out how to violate our
consciences

32 however conscience clauses are sometimes
interpreted differently and their use will often depend on the given
context

33

three members of the department of obstetrics gynecology and
reproductive sciences and the bixby center for global reproductive
health at ucsf have questioned whether conscience clauses are ethical
writing in a journal article that in some catholicowned hospitals the
private patient–physician relationship patient safety and patient
comfort are compromised by religious mandates that require physicians to
act contrary to the current standard of care in miscarriage
management
