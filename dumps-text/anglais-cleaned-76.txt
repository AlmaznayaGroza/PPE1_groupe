class consciousness and false consciousness are concepts introduced by
karl marx that were later expanded by social theorists who came after
him

 marx wrote about the theory in his book capital volume 1 and
again with his frequent collaborator friedrich engels in the
impassioned treatise manifesto of the communist party

 class
consciousness refers to the awareness by a social or economic class of
their position and interests within the structure of the economic order
and social system in which they live

 in contrast false consciousness
is a perception of one s relationships to social and economic systems of
an individual nature and a failure to see oneself as a part of a class
with particular class interests relative to the economic order and
social system



 marx s theory of class consciousness 

according to marxist theory class consciousness is an awareness of
one s social andor economic class relative to others as well as an
understanding of the economic rank of the class to which you belong in
the context of the larger society

 in addition class consciousness
involves an understanding of the defining social and economic
characteristics and collective interests of your own class within the
constructs of the given socioeconomic and political order



class consciousness is a core facet of marx s theory of class conflict
which focuses on the social economic and political relationships
between workers and owners within a capitalist economy

 the precept was
developed in conjunction with his theory on how workers might overthrow
the system of capitalism and then go on to create a new economic
social and political system based on equality rather than inequality
and exploitation



 the proletariat vs

 the bourgeoisie 

marx believed that the capitalist system was rooted in class
conflict—specifically the economic exploitation of the proletariat
workers by the bourgeoisie those who owned and controlled
production

 he reasoned that the system only functioned as long as the
workers did not recognize their unity as a class of laborers their
shared economic and political interests and the power inherent in their
numbers

 marx argued that when workers came to understand the totality
of these factors they would achieve class consciousness and this in
turn would lead to a workers revolution that would overthrow the
exploitative system of capitalism



hungarian social theorist georg lukács who followed in the tradition of
marxist theory expanded the concept by saying that class consciousness
is an achievement that opposes individual consciousness and results from
the group struggle to see the totality of social and economic systems



 the problem of false consciousness 

according to marx before workers developed a class consciousness they
were actually living with a false consciousness

 though marx never used
the actual term he did develop the ideas that it encompasses

 in
essence false consciousness is the opposite of class consciousness


individualistic rather than collective in nature it produces a view of
oneself as a single entity engaged in competition with others of one s
social and economic standing rather than as part of a group with
unified experiences struggles and interests

 according to marx and
other social theorists who followed false consciousness was dangerous
because it encouraged people to think and act in ways that were
counterintuitive to their economic social and political
selfinterests



marx saw false consciousness as a product of an unequal social system
controlled by a powerful minority of elites

 the false consciousness
among workers which prevented them from seeing their collective
interests and power was created by the material relations and
conditions of the capitalist system by the ideology the dominant
worldview and values of those who control the system and by social
institutions and how they function in society



marx cited the phenomenon of commodity fetishism—the way capitalist
production frames relationships between people workers and owners as
relationships between things money and products—with playing a key
role in producing false consciousness among workers

 he believed that
commodity fetishism served to obscure the fact that relations with
regard to production within a capitalist system are actually
relationships between people and that as such they are changeable



building on marx s theory italian scholar writer and activist antonio
gramsci expanded the ideological component of false consciousness by
arguing that a process of cultural hegemony guided by those holding
economic social and cultural power in society produced a common
sense way of thinking that embued the status quo with legitimacy


gramsci noted that by believing in the common sense of one s age a
person actually consents to the conditions of exploitation and
domination that one experiences

 this common sense—the ideology that
produces false consciousness—is actually a misrepresentation and
misunderstanding of the social relationships that define the economic
social and political systems



 false consciousness in a stratified society 

an example of how cultural hegemony works to produce false
consciousness—that is true both historically and today—is the belief
that upward mobility is possible for all people regardless of the
circumstances of their birth as long as they choose to dedicate
themselves to education training and hard work

 in the u

s

 this
belief is encapsulated in the ideal of the american dream

 viewing
society and one s place within it based on the set of assumptions
derived from common sense thinking results in a perception of being an
individual rather than part of a collective

 economic success and
failure rest squarely on the shoulders of the individual and do not take
into account the totality of the social economic and political systems
that shape our lives



at the time marx was writing about class consciousness he perceived
class as the relationship of people to the means of production—the
owners versus the workers

 while the model is still useful we can also
think about the economic stratification of our society into different
classes based on income occupation and social status

 decades worth
of demographic data reveals that the american dream and its promise of
upward mobility is largely a myth

 in truth the economic class a person
is born into is the primary determinant of how he or she will fair
economically as an adult

 however as long as a person believes the
myth he or she will continue to live and operate with a false
consciousness

 without a class consciousness they will fail to
recognize that the stratified economic system in which they re operating
was designed to afford only the bare minimum of money to workers while
funneling huge profits to the owners executives and financiers at the
top
