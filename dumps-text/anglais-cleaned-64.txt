false consciousness in philosophy particularly within critical theory
and other marxist schools and movements the notion that members of the
proletariat unwittingly misperceive their real position in society and
systematically misunderstand their genuine interests within the social
relations of production under capitalism

 false consciousness denotes
people s inability to recognize inequality oppression and exploitation
in a capitalist society because of the prevalence within it of views
that naturalize and legitimize the existence of social classes



despite its close assocation with marxism the term false consciousness
was never used by karl marx

 the first treatment of false consciousness
as a theoretical concept occurred in history and class consciousness
1923 by the hungarian philosopher and literary critic györgy lukács


the concept was further developed in the 20th century by marxist
scholars such as the germanborn american philosopher herbert marcuse
and the french sociologist henri lefebvre

 since the late 20th century
the concept has been utilized outside explicitly marxist theorizing in
studies of oppression on the basis of gender sexual orientation
ethnicity and race
