consciousness

first published fri jun 18 2004 substantive revision tue jan 14 2014

perhaps no aspect of mind is more familiar or more puzzling than
consciousness and our conscious experience of self and world

 the
problem of consciousness is arguably the central issue in current
theorizing about the mind

 despite the lack of any agreed upon theory of
consciousness there is a widespread if less than universal consensus
that an adequate account of mind requires a clear understanding of it
and its place in nature

 we need to understand both what consciousness
is and how it relates to other nonconscious aspects of reality

 history of the issue

questions about the nature of conscious awareness have likely been asked
for as long as there have been humans

 neolithic burial practices appear
to express spiritual beliefs and provide early evidence for at least
minimally reflective thought about the nature of human consciousness
pearson 1999 clark and rielsalvatore 2001

 preliterate cultures have
similarly been found invariably to embrace some form of spiritual or at
least animist view that indicates a degree of reflection about the
nature of conscious awareness



nonetheless some have argued that consciousness as we know it today is
a relatively recent historical development that arose sometime after the
homeric era jaynes 1974

 according to this view earlier humans
including those who fought the trojan war did not experience themselves
as unified internal subjects of their thoughts and actions at least not
in the ways we do today

 others have claimed that even during the
classical period there was no word of ancient greek that corresponds to
“consciousness” wilkes 1984 1988 1995

 though the ancients had much
to say about mental matters it is less clear whether they had any
specific concepts or concerns for what we now think of as consciousness



although the words “conscious” and “conscience” are used quite
differently today it is likely that the reformation emphasis on the
latter as an inner source of truth played some role in the inward turn
so characteristic of the modern reflective view of self

 the hamlet who
walked the stage in 1600 already saw his world and self with profoundly
modern eyes



by the beginning of the early modern era in the seventeenth century
consciousness had come full center in thinking about the mind

 indeed
from the mid17th through the late 19th century consciousness was
widely regarded as essential or definitive of the mental

 rené descartes
defined the very notion of thought pensée in terms of reflexive
consciousness or selfawareness

 in the principles of philosophy 1640
he wrote

 by the word thought pensée i understand all that of which we are
 conscious as operating in us



later toward the end of the 17th century john locke offered a similar
if slightly more qualified claim in an essay on human understanding
1688

 i do not say there is no soul in man because he is not sensible of it
 in his sleep

 but i do say he can not think at any time waking or
 sleeping without being sensible of it

 our being sensible of it is
 not necessary to anything but our thoughts and to them it is and to
 them it always will be necessary



locke explicitly forswore making any hypothesis about the substantial
basis of consciousness and its relation to matter but he clearly
regarded it as essential to thought as well as to personal identity



locke s contemporary g

w

 leibniz drawing possible inspiration from his
mathematical work on differentiation and integration offered a theory
of mind in the discourse on metaphysics 1686 that allowed for
infinitely many degrees of consciousness and perhaps even for some
thoughts that were unconscious the so called “petites perceptions”


leibniz was the first to distinguish explicitly between perception and
apperception i

e

 roughly between awareness and selfawareness

 in the
monadology 1720 he also offered his famous analogy of the mill to
express his belief that consciousness could not arise from mere matter


he asked his reader to imagine someone walking through an expanded brain
as one would walk through a mill and observing all its mechanical
operations which for leibniz exhausted its physical nature

 nowhere he
asserts would such an observer see any conscious thoughts



despite leibniz s recognition of the possibility of unconscious thought
for most of the next two centuries the domains of thought and
consciousness were regarded as more or less the same

 associationist
psychology whether pursued by locke or later in the eighteenth century
by david hume 1739 or in the nineteenth by james mill 1829 aimed to
discover the principles by which conscious thoughts or ideas interacted
or affected each other

 james mill s son john stuart mill continued his
father s work on associationist psychology but he allowed that
combinations of ideas might produce resultants that went beyond their
constituent mental parts thus providing an early model of mental
emergence 1865



the purely associationist approach was critiqued in the late eighteenth
century by immanuel kant 1787 who argued that an adequate account of
experience and phenomenal consciousness required a far richer structure
of mental and intentional organization

 phenomenal consciousness
according to kant could not be a mere succession of associated ideas
but at a minimum had to be the experience of a conscious self situated
in an objective world structured with respect to space time and
causality



within the angloamerican world associationist approaches continued to
be influential in both philosophy and psychology well into the twentieth
century while in the german and european sphere there was a greater
interest in the larger structure of experience that led in part to the
study of phenomenology through the work of edmund husserl 1913 1929
martin heidegger 1927 maurice merleauponty 1945 and others who
expanded the study of consciousness into the realm of the social the
bodily and the interpersonal



at the outset of modern scientific psychology in the midnineteenth
century the mind was still largely equated with consciousness and
introspective methods dominated the field as in the work of wilhelm
wundt 1897 hermann von helmholtz 1897 william james 1890 and
alfred titchener 1901

 however the relation of consciousness to brain
remained very much a mystery as expressed in t

 h

 huxley s famous
remark

 how it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness
 comes about as a result of irritating nervous tissue is just as
 unaccountable as the appearance of the djin when aladdin rubbed his
 lamp 1866



the early twentieth century saw the eclipse of consciousness from
scientific psychology especially in the united states with the rise of
behaviorism watson 1924 skinner 1953 though movements such as gestalt
psychology kept it a matter of ongoing scientific concern in europe
köhler 1929 köffka 1935

 in the 1960s the grip of behaviorism
weakened with the rise of cognitive psychology and its emphasis on
information processing and the modeling of internal mental processes
neisser 1965 gardiner 1985

 however despite the renewed emphasis on
explaining cognitive capacities such as memory perception and language
comprehension consciousness remained a largely neglected topic for
several further decades



in the 1980s and 90s there was a major resurgence of scientific and
philosophical research into the nature and basis of consciousness baars
1988 dennett 1991 penrose 1989 1994 crick 1994 lycan 1987 1996
chalmers 1996

 once consciousness was back under discussion there was
a rapid proliferation of research with a flood of books and articles as
well as the introduction of specialty journals the journal of
consciousness studies consciousness and cognition psyche
professional societies association for the scientific study of
consciousness—assc and annual conferences devoted exclusively to its
investigation “the science of consciousness”

 concepts of consciousness

the words “conscious” and “consciousness” are umbrella terms that cover
a wide variety of mental phenomena

 both are used with a diversity of
meanings and the adjective “conscious” is heterogeneous in its range
being applied both to whole organisms—creature consciousness—and to
particular mental states and processes—state consciousness rosenthal
1986 gennaro 1995 carruthers 2000

1 creature consciousness

an animal person or other cognitive system may be regarded as conscious
in a number of different senses



sentience

 it may be conscious in the generic sense of simply being a
sentient creature one capable of sensing and responding to its world
armstrong 1981

 being conscious in this sense may admit of degrees
and just what sort of sensory capacities are sufficient may not be
sharply defined

 are fish conscious in the relevant respect

 and what of
shrimp or bees



wakefulness

 one might further require that the organism actually be
exercising such a capacity rather than merely having the ability or
disposition to do so

 thus one might count it as conscious only if it
were awake and normally alert

 in that sense organisms would not count
as conscious when asleep or in any of the deeper levels of coma

 again
boundaries may be blurry and intermediate cases may be involved

 for
example is one conscious in the relevant sense when dreaming
hypnotized or in a fugue state



selfconsciousness

 a third and yet more demanding sense might define
conscious creatures as those that are not only aware but also aware that
they are aware thus treating creature consciousness as a form of
selfconsciousness carruthers 2000

 the selfawareness requirement
might get interpreted in a variety of ways and which creatures would
qualify as conscious in the relevant sense will vary accordingly

 if it
is taken to involve explicit conceptual selfawareness many nonhuman
animals and even young children might fail to qualify but if only more
rudimentary implicit forms of selfawareness are required then a wide
range of nonlinguistic creatures might count as selfconscious



what it is like

 thomas nagel s 1974 famous“what it is like” criterion
aims to capture another and perhaps more subjective notion of being a
conscious organism

 according to nagel a being is conscious just if
there is “something that it is like” to be that creature i

e

 some
subjective way the world seems or appears from the creature s mental or
experiential point of view

 in nagel s example bats are conscious
because there is something that it is like for a bat to experience its
world through its echolocatory senses even though we humans from our
human point of view can not emphatically understand what such a mode of
consciousness is like from the bat s own point of view



subject of conscious states

 a fifth alternative would be to define the
notion of a conscious organism in terms of conscious states

 that is
one might first define what makes a mental state a conscious mental
state and then define being a conscious creature in terms of having
such states

 one s concept of a conscious organism would then depend
upon the particular account one gives of conscious states section 2

2



transitive consciousness

 in addition to describing creatures as
conscious in these various senses there are also related senses in
which creatures are described as being conscious of various things

 the
distinction is sometimes marked as that between transitive and
intransitive notions of consciousness with the former involving some
object at which consciousness is directed rosenthal 1986



2

2 state consciousness

the notion of a conscious mental state also has a variety of distinct
though perhaps interrelated meanings

 there are at least six major
options



states one is aware of

 on one common reading a conscious mental state
is simply a mental state one is aware of being in rosenthal 1986
1996

 conscious states in this sense involve a form of metamentality
or metaintentionality in so far as they require mental states that are
themselves about mental states

 to have a conscious desire for a cup of
coffee is to have such a desire and also to be simultaneously and
directly aware that one has such a desire

 unconscious thoughts and
desires in this sense are simply those we have without being aware of
having them whether our lack of selfknowledge results from simple
inattention or more deeply psychoanalytic causes



qualitative states

 states might also be regarded as conscious in a
seemingly quite different and more qualitative sense

 that is one might
count a state as conscious just if it has or involves qualitative or
experiential properties of the sort often referred to as “qualia” or
“raw sensory feels”

 see the entry on qualia

 one s perception of the
merlot one is drinking or of the fabric one is examining counts as a
conscious mental state in this sense because it involves various sensory
qualia e

g

 taste qualia in the wine case and color qualia in one s
visual experience of the cloth

 there is considerable disagreement about
the nature of such qualia churchland 1985 shoemaker 1990 clark 1993
chalmers 1996 and even about their existence

 traditionally qualia have
been regarded as intrinsic private ineffable monadic features of
experience but current theories of qualia often reject at least some of
those commitments dennett 1990



phenomenal states

 such qualia are sometimes referred to as phenomenal
properties and the associated sort of consciousness as phenomenal
consciousness but the latter term is perhaps more properly applied to
the overall structure of experience and involves far more than sensory
qualia

 the phenomenal structure of consciousness also encompasses much
of the spatial temporal and conceptual organization of our experience
of the world and of ourselves as agents in it see section 4

3

 it is
therefore probably best at least initially to distinguish the concept
of phenomenal consciousness from that of qualitative consciousness
though they no doubt overlap



whatitislike states

 consciousness in both those senses links up as
well with thomas nagel s 1974 notion of a conscious creature insofar
as one might count a mental state as conscious in the “what it is like”
sense just if there is something that it is like to be in that state


nagel s criterion might be understood as aiming to provide a
firstperson or internal conception of what makes a state a phenomenal
or qualitative state



access consciousness

 states might be conscious in a seemingly quite
different access sense which has more to do with intramental
relations

 in this respect a state s being conscious is a matter of its
availability to interact with other states and of the access that one
has to its content

 in this more functional sense which corresponds to
what ned block 1995 calls access consciousness a visual state s being
conscious is not so much a matter of whether or not it has a qualitative
“what it s likeness” but of whether or not it and the visual
information that it carries is generally available for use and guidance
by the organism

 in so far as the information in that state is richly
and flexibly available to its containing organism then it counts as a
conscious state in the relevant respect whether or not it has any
qualitative or phenomenal feel in the nagel sense



narrative consciousness

 states might also be regarded as conscious in a
narrative sense that appeals to the notion of the “stream of
consciousness” regarded as an ongoing more or less serial narrative of
episodes from the perspective of an actual or merely virtual self

 the
idea would be to equate the person s conscious mental states with those
that appear in the stream dennett 1991 1992



although these six notions of what makes a state conscious can be
independently specified they are obviously not without potential links
nor do they exhaust the realm of possible options

 drawing connections
one might argue that states appear in the stream of consciousness only
in so far as we are aware of them and thus forge a bond between the
first metamental notion of a conscious state and the stream or
narrative concept

 or one might connect the access with the qualitative
or phenomenal notions of a conscious state by trying to show that states
that represent in those ways make their contents widely available in the
respect required by the access notion



aiming to go beyond the six options one might distinguish conscious
from nonconscious states by appeal to aspects of their intramental
dynamics and interactions other than mere access relations e

g


conscious states might manifest a richer stock of contentsensitive
interactions or a greater degree of flexible purposive guidance of the
sort associated with the selfconscious control of thought


alternatively one might try to define conscious states in terms of
conscious creatures

 that is one might give some account of what it is
to be a conscious creature or perhaps even a conscious self and then
define one s notion of a conscious state in terms of being a state of
such a creature or system which would be the converse of the last
option considered above for defining conscious creatures in terms of
conscious mental states

3 consciousness as an entity

the noun “consciousness” has an equally diverse range of meanings that
largely parallel those of the adjective “conscious”

 distinctions can be
drawn between creature and state consciousness as well as among the
varieties of each

 one can refer specifically to phenomenal
consciousness access consciousness reflexive or metamental
consciousness and narrative consciousness among other varieties



here consciousness itself is not typically treated as a substantive
entity but merely the abstract reification of whatever property or
aspect is attributed by the relevant use of the adjective “conscious”


access consciousness is just the property of having the required sort of
internal access relations and qualitative consciousness is simply the
property that is attributed when “conscious” is applied in the
qualitative sense to mental states

 how much this commits one to the
ontological status of consciousness per se will depend on how much of a
platonist one is about universals in general

 see the entry on the
medieval problem of universals

 it need not commit one to consciousness
as a distinct entity any more than one s use of “square” “red” or
“gentle” commits one to the existence of squareness redness or
gentleness as distinct entities



though it is not the norm one could nonetheless take a more robustly
realist view of consciousness as a component of reality

 that is one
could think of consciousness as more on a par with electromagnetic
fields than with life



since the demise of vitalism we do not think of life per se as
something distinct from living things

 there are living things including
organisms states properties and parts of organisms communities and
evolutionary lineages of organisms but life is not itself a further
thing an additional component of reality some vital force that gets
added into living things

 we apply the adjectives “living” and “alive”
correctly to many things and in doing so we might be said to be
attributing life to them but with no meaning or reality other than that
involved in their being living things



electromagnetic fields by contrast are regarded as real and independent
parts of our physical world

 even though one may sometimes be able to
specify the values of such a field by appeal to the behavior of
particles in it the fields themselves are regarded as concrete
constituents of reality and not merely as abstractions or sets of
relations among particles



similarly one could regard “consciousness” as referring to a component
or aspect of reality that manifests itself in conscious states and
creatures but is more than merely the abstract nominalization of the
adjective “conscious” we apply to them

 though such strongly realist
views are not very common at present they should be included within the
logical space of options



there are thus many concepts of consciousness and both “conscious” and
“consciousness” are used in a wide range of ways with no privileged or
canonical meaning

 however this may be less of an embarrassment than an
embarrassment of riches

 consciousness is a complex feature of the
world and understanding it will require a diversity of conceptual tools
for dealing with its many differing aspects

 conceptual plurality is
thus just what one would hope for

 as long as one avoids confusion by
being clear about one s meanings there is great value in having a
variety of concepts by which we can access and grasp consciousness in
all its rich complexity

 however one should not assume that conceptual
plurality implies referential divergence

 our multiple concepts of
consciousness may in fact pick out varying aspects of a single unified
underlying mental phenomenon

 whether and to what extent they do so
remains an open question



3

 problems of consciousness

the task of understanding consciousness is an equally diverse project


not only do many different aspects of mind count as conscious in some
sense each is also open to various respects in which it might be
explained or modeled

 understanding consciousness involves a
multiplicity not only of explananda but also of questions that they pose
and the sorts of answers they require

 at the risk of oversimplifying
the relevant questions can be gathered under three crude rubrics as the
what how and why questions

 the descriptive question what is consciousness

 what are its
 principal features

 and by what means can they be best discovered
 described and modeled


 the explanatory question how does consciousness of the relevant
 sort come to exist

 is it a primitive aspect of reality and if not
 how does or could consciousness in the relevant respect arise from
 or be caused by nonconscious entities or processes


 the functional question why does consciousness of the relevant sort
 exist

 does it have a function and if so what is it

 does it act
 causally and if so with what sorts of effects

 does it make a
 difference to the operation of systems in which it is present and
 if so why and how



the three questions focus respectively on describing the features of
consciousness explaining its underlying basis or cause and explicating
its role or value

 the divisions among the three are of course somewhat
artificial and in practice the answers one gives to each will depend in
part on what one says about the others

 one can not for example
adequately answer the what question and describe the main features of
consciousness without addressing the why issue of its functional role
within systems whose operations it affects

 nor could one explain how
the relevant sort of consciousness might arise from nonconscious
processes unless one had a clear account of just what features had to be
caused or realized to count as producing it

 those caveats
notwithstanding the threeway division of questions provides a useful
structure for articulating the overall explanatory project and for
assessing the adequacy of particular theories or models of
consciousness



4

 the descriptive question what are the features of consciousness



the what question asks us to describe and model the principal features
of consciousness but just which features are relevant will vary with
the sort of consciousness we aim to capture

 the main properties of
access consciousness may be quite unlike those of qualitative or
phenomenal consciousness and those of reflexive consciousness or
narrative consciousness may differ from both

 however by building up
detailed theories of each type we may hope to find important links
between them and perhaps even to discover that they coincide in at least
some key respects

1 firstperson and thirdperson data

the general descriptive project will require a variety of
investigational methods flanagan 1992

 though one might naively regard
the facts of consciousness as too selfevident to require any systematic
methods of gathering data the epistemic task is in reality far from
trivial husserl 1913



firstperson introspective access provides a rich and essential source
of insight into our conscious mental life but it is neither sufficient
in itself nor even especially helpful unless used in a trained and
disciplined way

 gathering the needed evidence about the structure of
experience requires us both to become phenomenologically sophisticated
selfobservers and to complement our introspective results with many
types of thirdperson data available to external observers searle 1992
varela 1995 siewert 1998

as phenomenologists have known for more than a century discovering the
structure of conscious experience demands a rigorous innerdirected
stance that is quite unlike our everyday form of selfawareness husserl
1929 merleauponty 1945

 skilled observation of the needed sort
requires training effort and the ability to adopt alternative
perspectives on one s experience



the need for thirdperson empirical data gathered by external observers
is perhaps most obvious with regard to the more clearly functional types
of consciousness such as access consciousness but it is required even
with regard to phenomenal and qualitative consciousness

 for example
deficit studies that correlate various neural and functional sites of
damage with abnormalities of conscious experience can make us aware of
aspects of phenomenal structure that escape our normal introspective
awareness

 as such case studies show things can come apart in
experience that seem inseparably unified or singular from our normal
firstperson point of view sacks 1985 shallice 1988 farah 1995



or to pick another example thirdperson data can make us aware of how
our experiences of acting and our experiences of eventtiming affect
each other in ways that we could never discern through mere
introspection libet 1985 wegner 2002

 nor are the facts gathered by
these third person methods merely about the causes or bases of
consciousness they often concern the very structure of phenomenal
consciousness itself

 firstperson thirdperson and perhaps even
secondperson varela 1995 interactive methods will all be needed to
collect the requisite evidence



using all these sources of data we will hopefully be able to construct
detailed descriptive models of the various sorts of consciousness


though the specific features of most importance may vary among the
different types our overall descriptive project will need to address at
least the following seven general aspects of consciousness sections

2 qualitative character

qualitative character is often equated with so called “raw feels” and
illustrated by the redness one experiences when one looks at ripe
tomatoes or the specific sweet savor one encounters when one tastes an
equally ripe pineapple locke 1688

 the relevant sort of qualitative
character is not restricted to sensory states but is typically taken to
be present as an aspect of experiential states in general such as
experienced thoughts or desires siewert 1998



the existence of such feels may seem to some to mark the threshold for
states or creatures that are really conscious

 if an organism senses and
responds in apt ways to its world but lacks such qualia then it might
count as conscious at best in a loose and less than literal sense

 or so
at least it would seem to those who take qualitative consciousness in
the “what it is like” sense to be philosophically and scientifically
central nagel 1974 chalmers 1996



qualia problems in many forms—can there be inverted qualia

 block 1980a
1980b shoemaker 1981 1982 are qualia epiphenomenal

 jackson 1982
chalmers 1996 how could neural states give rise to qualia

 levine
1983 mcginn 1991—have loomed large in the recent past

 but the what
question raises a more basic problem of qualia namely that of giving a
clear and articulated description of our qualia space and the status of
specific qualia within it



absent such a model factual or descriptive errors are all too likely


for example claims about the unintelligibility of the link between
experienced red and any possible neural substrate of such an experience
sometimes treat the relevant color quale as a simple and sui generis
property levine 1983 but phenomenal redness in fact exists within a
complex color space with multiple systematic dimensions and similarity
relations hardin 1992

 understanding the specific color quale relative
to that larger relational structure not only gives us a better
descriptive grasp of its qualitative nature it may also provide some
“hooks” to which one might attach intelligible psychophysical links



color may be the exception in terms of our having a specific and well
developed formal understanding of the relevant qualitative space but it
is not likely an exception with regard to the importance of such spaces
to our understanding of qualitative properties in general clark 1993

m

 churchland 1995

 see the entry on qualia

3 phenomenal structure

phenomenal structure should not be conflated with qualitative structure
despite the sometimes interchangeable use of “qualia” and “phenomenal
properties” in the literature

 “phenomenal organization” covers all the
various kinds of order and structure found within the domain of
experience i

e

 within the domain of the world as it appears to us


there are obviously important links between the phenomenal and the
qualitative

 indeed qualia might be best understood as properties of
phenomenal or experienced objects but there is in fact far more to the
phenomenal than raw feels

 as kant 1787 husserl 1913 and
generations of phenomenologists have shown the phenomenal structure of
experience is richly intentional and involves not only sensory ideas and
qualities but complex representations of time space cause body self
world and the organized structure of lived reality in all its conceptual
and nonconceptual forms



since many nonconscious states also have intentional and
representational aspects it may be best to consider phenomenal
structure as involving a special kind of intentional and
representational organization and content the kind distinctively
associated with consciousness siewert 1998

 see the entry on
representational theories of consciousness



answering the what question requires a careful account of the coherent
and densely organized representational framework within which particular
experiences are embedded

 since most of that structure is only implicit
in the organization of experience it can not just be read off by
introspection

 articulating the structure of the phenomenal domain in a
clear and intelligible way is a long and difficult process of inference
and model building husserl 1929

 introspection can aid it but a lot
of theory construction and ingenuity are also needed



there has been recent philosophical debate about the range of properties
that are phenomenally present or manifest in conscious experience in
particular with respect to cognitive states such as believing or
thinking

 some have argued for a so called “thin” view according to
which phenomenal properties are limited to qualia representing basic
sensory properties such as colors shapes tones and feels

 according
to such theorists there is no distinctive “whatitislikeness”
involved in believing that paris is the capital of france or that 17 is
a prime number tye prinz 2012

 some imagery e

g

 of the eiffel
tower may accompany our having such a thought but that is incidental
to it and the cognitive state itself has no phenomenal feel

 on the thin
view the phenomenal aspect of perceptual states as well is limited to
basic sensory features when one sees an image of winston churchill
one s perceptual phenomenology is limited only to the spatial aspects of
his face



others holds a “thick” view according to which the phenomenology of
perception includes a much wider range of features and cognitive states
have a distinctive phenomenology as well strawson 2003 pitt 2004
seigel 2010

 on the thick view the whatitislikeness of perceiving
an image of marilyn monroe includes one s recognition of her history as
part of the felt aspect of the experience and beliefs and thoughts as
well can and typically do have a distinctive nonsensory phenomenology


both sides of the debate are well represented in the volume cognitive
phenomenology bayne and montague 2010

4 subjectivity

subjectivity is another notion sometimes equated with the qualitative or
the phenomenal aspects of consciousness in the literature but again
there are good reason to recognize it at least in some of its forms as
a distinct feature of consciousness—related to the qualitative and the
phenomenal but different from each

 in particular the epistemic form of
subjectivity concerns apparent limits on the knowability or even the
understandability of various facts about conscious experience nagel
1974 van gulick 1985 lycan 1996



on thomas nagel s 1974 account facts about what it is like to be a
bat are subjective in the relevant sense because they can be fully
understood only from the battype point of view

 only creatures capable
of having or undergoing similar such experiences can understand their
whatit slikeness in the requisite empathetic sense

 facts about
conscious experience can be at best incompletely understood from an
outside third person point of view such as those associated with
objective physical science

 a similar view about the limits of
thirdperson theory seems to lie behind claims regarding what frank
jackson s 1982 hypothetical mary the super color scientist could not
understand about experiencing red because of her own impoverished
history of achromatic visual experience



whether facts about experience are indeed epistemically limited in this
way is open to debate lycan 1996 but the claim that understanding
consciousness requires special forms of knowing and access from the
inside point of view is intuitively plausible and has a long history
locke 1688

 thus any adequate answer to the what question must address
the epistemic status of consciousness both our abilities to understand
it and their limits papineau 2002 chalmers 2003

5 selfperspectival organization

the perspectival structure of consciousness is one aspect of its overall
phenomenal organization but it is important enough to merit discussion
in its own right

 insofar as the key perspective is that of the
conscious self the specific feature might be called
selfperspectuality

 conscious experiences do not exist as isolated
mental atoms but as modes or states of a conscious self or subject
descartes 1644 searle 1992 though pace hume 1739

 a visual
experience of a blue sphere is always a matter of there being some self
or subject who is appeared to in that way

 a sharp and stabbing pain is
always a pain felt or experienced by some conscious subject

 the self
need not appear as an explicit element in our experiences but as kant
1787 noted the “i think” must at least potentially accompany each of
them



the self might be taken as the perspectival point from which the world
of objects is present to experience wittgenstein 1921

 it provides not
only a spatial and temporal perspective for our experience of the world
but one of meaning and intelligibility as well

 the intentional
coherence of the experiential domain relies upon the dual
interdependence between self and world the self as perspective from
which objects are known and the world as the integrated structure of
objects and events whose possibilities of being experienced implicitly
define the nature and location of the self kant 1787 husserl 1929



conscious organisms obviously differ in the extent to which they
constitute a unified and coherent self and they likely differ
accordingly in the sort or degree of perspectival focus they embody in
their respective forms of experience lorenz 1977

 consciousness may
not require a distinct or substantial self of the traditional cartesian
sort but at least some degree of perspectivally selflike organization
seems essential for the existence of anything that might count as
conscious experience

 experiences seem no more able to exist without a
self or subject to undergo them than could ocean waves exist without the
sea through which they move

 the descriptive question thus requires some
account of the selfperspectival aspect of experience and the selflike
organization of conscious minds on which it depends even if the
relevant account treats the self in a relatively deflationary and
virtual way dennett 1991 1992



4

6 unity

unity is closely linked with the selfperspective but it merits
specific mention on its own as a key aspect of the organization of
consciousness

 conscious systems and conscious mental states both
involve many diverse forms of unity

 some are causal unities associated
with the integration of action and control into a unified focus of
agency

 others are more representational and intentional forms of unity
involving the integration of diverse items of content at many scales and
levels of binding cleeremans 2003



some such integrations are relatively local as when diverse features
detected within a single sense modality are combined into a
representation of external objects bearing those features e

g

 when one
has a conscious visual experience of a moving red soup can passing above
a green striped napkin triesman and gelade 1980



other forms of intentional unity encompass a far wider range of
contents

 the content of one s present experience of the room in which
one sits depends in part upon its location within a far larger structure
associated with one s awareness of one s existence as an ongoing
temporally extended observer within a world of spatially connected
independently existing objects kant 1787 husserl 1913

 the individual
experience can have the content that it does only because it resides
within that larger unified structure of representation

 see the entry
on unity of consciousness



particular attention has been paid recently to the notion of phenomenal
unity bayne 2010 and its relation to other forms of conscious unity
such as those involving representational functional or neural
integration

 some have argued that phenomenal unity can be reduced to
representational unity tye 2005 while others have denied the
possibility of any such reduction bayne 2010

7 intentionality and transparency

conscious mental states are typically regarded as having a
representational or intentional aspect in so far as they are about
things refer to things or have satisfaction conditions

 one s conscious
visual experience correctly represents the world if there are lilacs in
a white vase on the table pace travis 2004 one s conscious memory is
of the attack on the world trade center and one s conscious desire is
for a glass of cold water

 however nonconscious states can also exhibit
intentionality in such ways and it is important to understand the ways
in which the representational aspects of conscious states resemble and
differ from those of nonconscious states carruthers 2000

 searle
1990 offers a contrary view according to which only conscious states
and dispositions to have conscious states can be genuinely intentional
but most theorists regard intentionality as extending widely into the
unconscious domain

 see the entry on consciousness and intentionality



one potentially important dimension of difference concerns so called
transparency which is an important feature of consciousness in two
interrelated metaphoric senses each of which has an intentional an
experiential and a functional aspect



conscious perceptual experience is often said to be transparent or in
g

e

 moore s 1922 phrase “diaphanous”

 we transparently “look through”
our sensory experience in so far as we seem directly aware of external
objects and events present to us rather than being aware of any
properties of experience by which it presents or represents such objects
to us

 when i look out at the windblown meadow it is the undulating
green grass of which i am aware not of any green property of my visual
experience

 see the entry on representational theories of
consciousness

 moore himself believed we could become aware of those
latter qualities with effort and redirection of attention though some
contemporary transparency advocates deny it harman 1990 tye 1995 kind
2003



conscious thoughts and experiences are also transparent in a semantic
sense in that their meanings seem immediately known to us in the very
act of thinking them van gulick 1992

 in that sense we might be said
to think right through them to what they mean or represent


transparency in this semantic sense may correspond at least partly with
what john searle calls the “intrinsic intentionality” of consciousness
searle 1992



our conscious mental states seem to have their meanings intrinsically or
from the inside just by being what they are in themselves by contrast
with many externalist theories of mental content that ground meaning in
causal counterfactual or informational relations between bearers of
intentionality and their semantic or referential objects



the view of conscious content as intrinsically determined and internally
selfevident is sometimes supported by appeals to brain in the vat
intuitions which make it seem that the envatted brain s conscious
mental states would keep all their normal intentional contents despite
the loss of all their normal causal and informational links to the world
horgan and tienson 2002

 there is continued controversy about such
cases and about competing internalist searle 1992 and externalist
views dretske 1995 of conscious intentionality



though semantic transparency and intrinsic intentionality have some
affinities they should not be simply equated since it may be possible
to accommodate the former notion within a more externalist account of
content and meaning

 both semantic and sensory transparency obviously
concern the representational or intentional aspects of consciousness
but they are also experiential aspects of our conscious life

 they are
part of what it s like or how it feels phenomenally to be conscious


they also both have functional aspects in so far as conscious
experiences interact with each other in richly contentappropriate ways
that manifest our transparent understanding of their contents



4

8 dynamic flow

the dynamics of consciousness are evident in the coherent order of its
ever changing process of flow and selftransformation what william
james 1890 called the “stream of consciousness

” some temporal
sequences of experience are generated by purely internal factors as when
one thinks through a puzzle and others depend in part upon external
causes as when one chases a fly ball but even the latter sequences are
shaped in large part by how consciousness transforms itself



whether partly in response to outer influences or entirely from within
each moment to moment sequence of experience grows coherently out of
those that preceded it constrained and enabled by the global structure
of links and limits embodied in its underlying prior organization
husserl 1913

 in that respect consciousness is an autopoietic system
i

e

 a selfcreating and selforganizing system varela and maturana
1980



as a conscious mental agent i can do many things such as scan my room
scan a mental image of it review in memory the courses of a recent
restaurant meal along with many of its tastes and scents reason my way
through a complex problem or plan a grocery shopping trip and execute
that plan when i arrive at the market

 these are all routine and common
activities but each involves the directed generation of experiences in
ways that manifest an implicit practical understanding of their
intentional properties and interconnected contents van gulick 2000



consciousness is a dynamic process and thus an adequate descriptive
answer to the what question must deal with more than just its static or
momentary properties

 in particular it must give some account of the
temporal dynamics of consciousness and the ways in which its
selftransforming flow reflects both its intentional coherence and the
semantic selfunderstanding embodied in the organized controls through
which conscious minds continually remake themselves as autopoietic
systems engaged with their worlds



a comprehensive descriptive account of consciousness would need to deal
with more than just these seven features but having a clear account of
each of them would take us a long way toward answering the “what is
consciousness

” question



5

 the explanatory question how can consciousness exist



the how question focuses on explanation rather than description

 it asks
us to explain the basic status of consciousness and its place in nature


is it a fundamental feature of reality in its own right or does its
existence depend upon other nonconscious items be they physical
biological neural or computational

 and if the latter can we explain
or understand how the relevant nonconscious items could cause or realize
consciousness

 put simply can we explain how to make something
conscious out of things that are not conscious



5

1 diversity of explanatory projects

the how question is not a single question but rather a general family
of more specific questions van gulick 1995

 they all concern the
possibility of explaining some sort or aspect of consciousness but they
vary in their particular explananda the restrictions on their
explanans and their criteria for successful explanation

 for example
one might ask whether we can explain access consciousness
computationally by mimicking the requisite access relations in a
computational model

 or one might be concerned instead with whether the
phenomenal and qualitative properties of a conscious creature s mind can
be a priori deduced from a description of the neural properties of its
brain processes

 both are versions of the how question but they ask
about the prospects of very different explanatory projects and thus may
differ in their answers lycan 1996

 it would be impractical if not
impossible to catalog all the possible versions of the how question
but some of the main options can be listed



explananda

 possible explananda would include the various sorts of state
and creature consciousness distinguished above as well as the seven
features of consciousness listed in response to the what question

 those
two types of explananda overlap and intersect

 we might for example aim
to explain the dynamic aspect either of phenomenal or of access
consciousness

 or we could try to explain the subjectivity of either
qualitative or metamental consciousness

 not every feature applies to
every sort of consciousness but all apply to several

 how one explains
a given feature in relation to one sort of consciousness may not
correspond with what is needed to explain it relative to another



explanans

 the range of possible explanans is also diverse

 in perhaps
its broadest form the how question asks how consciousness of the
relevant sort could be caused or realized by nonconscious items but we
can generate a wealth of more specific questions by further restricting
the range of the relevant explanans

 one might seek to explain how a
given feature of consciousness is caused or realized by underlying
neural processes biological structures physical mechanisms functional
or teleofunctional relations computational organization or even by
nonconscious mental states

 the prospects for explanatory success will
vary accordingly

 in general the more limited and elementary the range
of the explanans the more difficult the problem of explaining how could
it suffice to produce consciousness van gulick 1995



criteria of explanation

 the third key parameter is how one defines the
criterion for a successful explanation

 one might require that the
explanandum be a priori deducible from the explanans although it is
controversial whether this is either a necessary or a sufficient
criterion for explaining consciousness jackson 1993

 its sufficiency
will depend in part on the nature of the premises from which the
deduction proceeds

 as a matter of logic one will need some bridge
principles to connect propositions or sentences about consciousness with
those that do not mention it

 if one s premises concern physical or
neural facts then one will need some bridge principles or links that
connect such facts with facts about consciousness kim 1998

 brute
links whether nomic or merely well confirmed correlations could
provide a logically sufficient bridge to infer conclusions about
consciousness

 but they would probably not allow us to see how or why
those connections hold and thus they would fall short of fully
explaining how consciousness exists levine 1983 1993 mcginn 1991



one could legitimately ask for more in particular for some account that
made intelligible why those links hold and perhaps why they could not
fail to do so

 a familiar twostage model for explaining
macroproperties in terms of microsubstrates is often invoked

 in the
first step one analyzes the macroproperty in terms of functional
conditions and then in the second stage one shows that the
microstructures obeying the laws of their own level nomically suffice
to guarantee the satisfaction of the relevant functional conditions
armstrong 1968 lewis 1972



the microproperties of collections of h2o molecules at 20°c suffice to
satisfy the conditions for the liquidity of the water they compose


moreover the model makes intelligible how the liquidity is produced by
the microproperties

 a satisfactory explanation of how consciousness is
produced might seem to require a similar two stage story

 without it
even a priori deducibility might seem explanatorily less than
sufficient though the need for such a story remains a matter of
controversy block and stalnaker 1999 chalmers and jackson 2001



5

2 the explanatory gap

our current inability to supply a suitably intelligible link is
sometimes described following joseph levine 1983 as the existence of
an explanatory gap and as indicating our incomplete understanding of
how consciousness might depend upon a nonconscious substrate especially
a physical substrate

 the basic gap claim admits of many variations in
generality and thus in strength



in perhaps its weakest form it asserts a practical limit on our present
explanatory abilities given our current theories and models we can not
now articulate an intelligible link

 a stronger version makes an in
principle claim about our human capacities and thus asserts that given
our human cognitive limits we will never be able to bridge the gap

 to
us or creatures cognitively like us it must remain a residual mystery
mcginn 1991

 colin mcginn 1995 has argued that given the inherently
spatial nature of both our human perceptual concepts and the scientific
concepts we derive from them we humans are not conceptually suited for
understanding the nature of the psychophysical link

 facts about that
link are as cognitively closed to us as are facts about multiplication
or square roots to armadillos

 they do not fall within our conceptual
and cognitive repertoire

 an even stronger version of the gap claim
removes the restriction to our cognitive nature and denies in principle
that the gap can be closed by any cognitive agents



those who assert gap claims disagree among themselves about what
metaphysical conclusions if any follow from our supposed epistemic
limits

 levine himself has been reluctant to draw any antiphysicalist
ontological conclusions levine 1993 2001

 on the other hand some
neodualists have tried to use the existence of the gap to refute
physicalism foster 1996 chalmers 1996

 the stronger one s
epistemological premise the better the hope of deriving a metaphysical
conclusion

 thus unsurprisingly dualist conclusions are often supported
by appeals to the supposed impossibility in principle of closing the
gap



if one could see on a priori grounds that there is no way in which
consciousness could be intelligibly explained as arising from the
physical it would not be a big step to concluding that it in fact does
not do so chalmers 1996

 however the very strength of such an
epistemological claim makes it difficult to assume with begging the
metaphysical result in question

 thus those who wish to use a strong in
principle gap claim to refute physicalism must find independent grounds
to support it

 some have appealed to conceivability arguments for
support such as the alleged conceivability of zombies molecularly
identical with conscious humans but devoid of all phenomenal
consciousness campbell 1970 kirk 1974 chalmers 1996

 other
supporting arguments invoke the supposed nonfunctional nature of
consciousness and thus its alleged resistance to the standard scientific
method of explaining complex properties e

g

 genetic dominance in
terms of physically realized functional conditions block 1980a
chalmers 1996

 such arguments avoid begging the antiphysicalist
question but they themselves rely upon claims and intuitions that are
controversial and not completely independent of one s basic view about
physicalism

 discussion on the topic remains active and ongoing



our present inability to see any way of closing the gap may exert some
pull on our intuitions but it may simply reflect the limits of our
current theorizing rather than an unbridgeable in principle barrier
dennett 1991

 moreover some physicalists have argued that explanatory
gaps are to be expected and are even entailed by plausible versions of
ontological physicalism ones that treat human agents as physically
realized cognitive systems with inherent limits that derive from their
evolutionary origin and situated contextual mode of understanding van
gulick 1985 2003 mcginn 1991 papineau 1995 2002

 on this view
rather than refuting physicalism the existence of explanatory gaps may
confirm it

 discussion and disagreement on these topics remains active
and ongoing



5

3 reductive and nonreductive explanation

as the need for intelligible linkage has shown a priori deducibility is
not in itself obviously sufficient for successful explanation kim
1980 nor is it clearly necessary

 some weaker logical link might
suffice in many explanatory contexts

 we can sometimes tell enough of a
story about how facts of one sort depend upon those of another to
satisfy ourselves that the latter do in fact cause or realize the former
even if we can not strictly deduce all the former facts from the latter



strict intertheoretical deduction was taken as the reductive norm by the
logical empiricist account of the unity of science putnam and oppenheim
1958 but in more recent decades a looser nonreductive picture of
relations among the various sciences has gained favor

 in particular
nonreductive materialists have argued for the so called “autonomy of the
special sciences” fodor 1974 and for the view that understanding the
natural world requires us to use a diversity of conceptual and
representational systems that may not be strictly intertranslatable or
capable of being put into the tight correspondence required by the older
deductive paradigm of interlevel relations putnam 1975



economics is often cited as an example fodor 1974 searle 1992


economic facts may be realized by underlying physical processes but no
one seriously demands that we be able to deduce the relevant economic
facts from detailed descriptions of their underlying physical bases or
that we be able to put the concepts and vocabulary of economics in tight
correspondence with those of the physical sciences



nonetheless our deductive inability is not seen as cause for ontological
misgivings there is no “moneymatter” problem

 all that we require is
some general and less than deductive understanding of how economic
properties and relations might be underlain by physical ones

 thus one
might opt for a similar criterion for interpreting the how question and
for what counts as explaining how consciousness might be caused or
realized by nonconscious items

 however some critics such as kim
1987 have challenged the coherence of any view that aims to be both
nonreductive and physicalist though supporters of such views have
replied in turn van gulick 1993



others have argued that consciousness is especially resistant to
explanation in physical terms because of the inherent differences
between our subjective and objective modes of understanding

 thomas
nagel famously argued 1974 that there are unavoidable limits placed on
our ability to understand the phenomenology of bat experience by our
inability to empathetically take on an experiential perspective like
that which characterizes the bat s echolocatory auditory experience of
its world

 given our inability to undergo similar experience we can
have at best partial understanding of the nature of such experience

 no
amount of knowledge gleaned from the external objective thirdperson
perspective of the natural sciences will supposedly suffice to allow us
to understand what the bat can understand of its own experience from its
internal firstperson subjective point of view



5

4 prospects of explanatory success

the how question thus subdivides into a diverse family of more specific
questions depending upon the specific sort or feature of consciousness
one aims to explain the specific restrictions one places on the range
of the explanans and the criterion one uses to define explanatory
success

 some of the resulting variants seem easier to answer than
others

 progress may seem likely on some of the so called “easy
problems” of consciousness such as explaining the dynamics of access
consciousness in terms of the functional or computational organization
of the brain baars 1988

 others may seem less tractable especially
the socalled “hard problem” chalmers 1995 which is more or less that
of giving an intelligible account that lets us see in an intuitively
satisfying way how phenomenal or “what it s like” consciousness might
arise from physical or neural processes in the brain



positive answers to some versions of the how questions seem near at
hand but others appear to remain deeply baffling

 nor should we assume
that every version has a positive answer

 if dualism is true then
consciousness in at least some of its types may be basic and
fundamental

 if sowe will not be able to explain how it arises from
nonconscious items since it simply does not do so



one s view of the prospects for explaining consciousness will typically
depend upon one s perspective

 optimistic physicalists will likely see
current explanatory lapses as merely the reflection of the early stage
of inquiry and sure to be remedied in the not too distant future
dennett 1991 searle 1992 p

 m

churchland 1995

 to dualists those
same impasses will signify the bankruptcy of the physicalist program and
the need to recognize consciousness as a fundamental constituent of
reality in its own right robinson 1982 foster 1989 1996 chalmers
1996

 what one sees depends in part on where one stands and the
ongoing project of explaining consciousness will be accompanied by
continuing debate about its status and prospects for success



6

 the functional question why does consciousness exist



the functional or why question asks about the value or role or
consciousness and thus indirectly about its origin

 does it have a
function and if so what is it

 does it make a difference to the
operation of systems in which it is present and if so why and how

 if
consciousness exists as a complex feature of biological systems then
its adaptive value is likely relevant to explaining its evolutionary
origin though of course its present function if it has one need not
be the same as that it may have had when it first arose

 adaptive
functions often change over biological time

 questions about the value
of consciousness also have a moral dimension in at least two ways

 we
are inclined to regard an organism s moral status as at least partly
determined by the nature and extent to which it is conscious and
conscious states especially conscious affective states such as
pleasures and pains play a major role in many of the accounts of value
that underlie moral theory singer 1975



as with the what and how questions the why question poses a general
problem that subdivides into a diversity of more specific inquiries

 in
so far as the various sorts of consciousness e

g

 access phenomenal
metamental are distinct and separable—which remains an open
question—they likely also differ in their specific roles and values


thus the why question may well not have a single or uniform answer



6

1 causal status of consciousness

perhaps the most basic issue posed by any version of the why question is
whether or not consciousness of the relevant sort has any causal impact
at all

 if it has no effects and makes no causal difference whatsoever
then it would seem unable to play any significant role in the systems or
organisms in which it is present thus undercutting at the outset most
inquiries about its possible value

 nor can the threat of epiphenomenal
irrelevance be simply dismissed as an obvious nonoption since at least
some forms of consciousness have been seriously alleged in the recent
literature to lack causal status

 see the entry on epiphenomenalism


such worries have been raised especially with regard to qualia and
qualitative consciousness huxley 1874 jackson 1982 chalmers 1996
but challenges have also been leveled against the causal status of other
sorts including metamental consciousness velmans 1991



both metaphysical and empirical arguments have been given in support of
such claims

 among the former are those that appeal to intuitions about
the conceivability and logical possibility of zombies i

e

 of beings
whose behavior functional organization and physical structure down to
the molecular level are identical to those of normal human agents but
who lack any qualia or qualitative consciousness

 some kirk 1970
chalmers 1996 assert such beings are possible in worlds that share all
our physical laws but others deny it dennett 1991 levine 2001

 if
they are possible in such worlds then it would seem to follow that even
in our world qualia do not affect the course of physical events
including those that constitute our human behaviors

 if those events
unfold in the same way whether or not qualia are present then qualia
appear to be inert or epiphenomenal at least with respect to events in
the physical world

 however such arguments and the zombie intuitions on
which they rely are controversial and their soundness remains in dispute
searle 1992 yablo 1998 balog 1999



arguments of a far more empirical sort have challenged the causal status
of metamental consciousness at least in so far as its presence can be
measured by the ability to report on one s mental state

 scientific
evidence is claimed to show that consciousness of that sort is neither
necessary for any type of mental ability nor does it occur early enough
to act as a cause of the acts or processes typically thought to be its
effects velmans 1991

 according to those who make such arguments the
sorts of mental abilities that are typically thought to require
consciousness can all be realized unconsciously in the absence of the
supposedly required selfawareness



moreover even when conscious selfawareness is present it allegedly
occurs too late to be the cause of the relevant actions rather than
their result or at best a joint effect of some shared prior cause libet
1985

 selfawareness or metamental consciousness according to these
arguments turns out to be a psychological aftereffect rather than an
initiating cause more like a post facto printout or the result
displayed on one s computer screen than like the actual processor
operations that produce both the computer s response and its display



once again the arguments are controversial and both the supposed data
and their interpretation are subjects of lively disagreement see
flanagan 1992 and commentaries accompanying velmans 1991

 though the
empirical arguments like the zombie claims require one to consider
seriously whether some forms of consciousness may be less causally
potent than is typically assumed many theorists regard the empirical
data as no real threat to the causal status of consciousness



if the epiphenomenalists are wrong and consciousness in its various
forms is indeed causal what sorts of effects does it have and what
differences does it make

 how do mental processes that involve the
relevant sort of consciousness differ form those that lack it

 what
functions might consciousness play

 the following six sections
6

2–6

7 discuss some of the more commonly given answers

 though the
various functions overlap to some degree each is distinct and they
differ as well in the sorts of consciousness with which each is most
aptly linked



6

2 flexible control

increased flexibility and sophistication of control

 conscious mental
processes appear to provide highly flexible and adaptive forms of
control

 though unconscious automatic processes can be extremely
efficient and rapid they typically operate in ways that are more fixed
and predetermined than those which involve conscious selfawareness
anderson 1983

 conscious awareness is thus of most importance when one
is dealing with novel situations and previously unencountered problems
or demands penfield 1975 armstrong 1981



standard accounts of skill acquisition stress the importance of
conscious awareness during the initial learning phase which gradually
gives way to more automatic processes of the sort that require little
attention or conscious oversight schneider and shiffrin 1977


conscious processing allows for the construction or compilation of
specifically tailored routines out of elementary units as well as for
the deliberate control of their execution



there is a familiar tradeoff between flexibility and speed controlled
conscious processes purchase their customized versatility at the price
of being slow and effortful in contrast to the fluid rapidity of
automatic unconscious mental operations anderson 1983

 the relevant
increases in flexibility would seem most closely connected with the
metamental or higherorder form of consciousness in so far as the
enhanced ability to control processes depends upon greater
selfawareness

 however flexibility and sophisticated modes of control
may be associated as well with the phenomenal and access forms of
consciousness



6

3 social coordination

enhanced capacity for social coordination

 consciousness of the
metamental sort may well involve not only an increase in selfawareness
but also an enhanced understanding of the mental states of other minded
creatures especially those of other members of one s social group
humphreys 1982

 creatures that are conscious in the relevant
metamental sense not only have beliefs motives perceptions and
intentions but understand what it is to have such states and are aware
of both themselves and others as having them



this increase in mutually shared knowledge of each other s minds
enables the relevant organisms to interact cooperate and communicate in
more advanced and adaptive ways

 although metamental consciousness is
the sort most obviously linked to such a socially coordinative role
narrative consciousness of the kind associated with the stream of
consciousness is also clearly relevant in so far as it involves the
application to one s own case of the interpretative abilities that
derive in part from their social application ryle 1949 dennett 1978
1992

4 integrated representation

more unified and densely integrated representation of reality

 conscious
experience presents us with a world of objects independently existing in
space and time

 those objects are typically present to us in a
multimodal fashion that involves the integration of information from
various sensory channels as well as from background knowledge and
memory

 conscious experience presents us not with isolated properties or
features but with objects and events situated in an ongoing independent
world and it does so by embodying in its experiential organization and
dynamics the dense network of relations and interconnections that
collectively constitute the meaningful structure of a world of objects
kant 1787 husserl 1913 campbell 1997



of course not all sensory information need be experienced to have an
adaptive effect on behavior

 adaptive nonexperiential sensorymotor
links can be found both in simple organisms as well as in some of the
more direct and reflexive processes of higher organisms

 but when
experience is present it provides a more unified and integrated
representation of reality one that typically allows for more openended
avenues of response lorenz 1977

 consider for example the
representation of space in an organism whose sensory input channels are
simply linked to movement or to the orientation of a few fixed
mechanisms such as those for feeding or grabbing prey and compare it
with that in an organism capable of using its spatial information for
flexible navigation of its environment and for whatever other spatially
relevant aims or goals it may have as when a person visually scans her
office or her kitchen gallistel 1990



it is representation of this latter sort that is typically made
available by the integrated mode of presentation associated with
conscious experience

 the unity of experienced space is just one example
of the sort of integration associated with our conscious awareness of an
objective world

 see the entry on unity of consciousness



this integrative role or value is most directly associated with access
consciousness but also clearly with the larger phenomenal and
intentional structure of experience

 it is relevant even to the
qualitative aspect of consciousness in so far as qualia play an
important role in our experience of unified objects in a unified space
or scene

 it is intimately tied as well to the transparency of
experience described in response to the what question especially to
semantic transparency van gulick 1993

 integration of information
plays a major role in several current neurocognitive theories of
consciousness especially global workspace theories see section 9

giulio tononi s integrated information theory section 9

5 informational access

more global informational access

 the information carried in conscious
mental states is typically available for use by a diversity of mental
subsystems and for application to a wide range of potential situations
and actions baars 1988

 nonconscious information is more likely to be
encapsulated within particular mental modules and available for use only
with respect to the applications directly connected to that subsystem s
operation fodor 1983

 making information conscious typically widens
the sphere of its influence and the range of ways it which it can be
used to adaptively guide or shape both inner and outer behavior

 a
state s being conscious may be in part a matter of what dennett calls
“cerebral celebrity” i

e

 of its ability to have a contentappropriate
impact on other mental states



this particular role is most directly and definitionally tied to the
notion of access consciousness block 1995 but metamental
consciousness as well as the phenomenal and qualitative forms all seem
plausibly linked to such increases in the availability of information
armstrong 1981 tye 1985

 diverse cognitive and neurocognitive
theories incorporate access as a central feature of consciousness and
conscious processing

 global workspace theories prinz s attendend
intermediate representation air prinz 2012 and tononi s integrated
information theory iit all distinguish conscious states and processes
at least partly in terms of enhanced wide spread access to the state s
content see section 9

6 freedom of will

increased freedom of choice or free will

 the issue of free will remains
a perennial philosophical problem not only with regard to whether or
not it exists but even as to what it might or should consist in dennett
1984 van inwagen 1983 hasker 1999 wegner 2002

 see the entry on
free will

 the notion of free will may itself remain too murky and
contentious to shed any clear light on the role of consciousness but
there is a traditional intuition that the two are deeply linked



consciousness has been thought to open a realm of possibilities a
sphere of options within which the conscious self might choose or act
freely

 at a minimum consciousness might seem a necessary precondition
for any such freedom or selfdetermination hasker 1999

 how could one
engage in the requisite sort of free choice while remaining solely
within the unconscious domain

 how can one determine one s own will
without being conscious of it and of the options one has to shape it



the freedom to chose one s actions and the ability to determine one s
own nature and future development may admit of many interesting
variations and degrees rather than being a simple all or nothing matter
and various forms or levels of consciousness might be correlated with
corresponding degrees or types of freedom and selfdetermination
dennett 1984 2003

 the link with freedom seems strongest for the
metamental form of consciousness given its emphasis on selfawareness
but potential connections also seem possible for most of the other sorts
as well

7 intrinsic motivation

intrinsically motivating states

 at least some conscious states appear
to have the motive force they do intrinsically

 in particular the
functional and motivational roles of conscious affective states such as
pleasures and pains seem intrinsic to their experiential character and
inseparable from their qualitative and phenomenal properties though the
view has been challenged nelkin 1989 rosenthal 1991

 the attractive
positive motivational aspect of a pleasure seems a part of its directly
experienced phenomenal feel as does the negative affective character of
a pain at least in the case of normal nonpathological experience



there is considerable disagreement about the extent to which the feel
and motive force of pain can dissociate in abnormal cases and some have
denied the existence of such intrinsically motivating aspects altogether
dennett 1991

 however at least in the normal case the negative
motivational force of pain seems built right into the feel of the
experience itself



just how this might be so remains less than clear and perhaps the
appearance of intrinsic and directly experienced motivational force is
illusory

 but if it is real then it may be one of the most important
and evolutionarily oldest respects in which consciousness makes a
difference to the mental systems and processes in which it is present
humphreys 1992



other suggestions have been made about the possible roles and value of
consciousness and these six surely do not exhaust the options


nonetheless they are among the most prominent recent hypotheses and
they provide a fair survey of the sorts of answers that have been
offered to the why question by those who believe consciousness does
indeed make a difference



6

8 constitutive and contingent roles

one further point requires clarification about the various respects in
which the proposed functions might answer the why question

 in
particular one should distinguish between constitutive cases and cases
of contingent realization

 in the former fulfilling the role
constitutes being conscious in the relevant sense while in the latter
case consciousness of a given sort is just one way among several in
which the requisite role might be realized van gulick 1993



for example making information globally available for use by a wide
variety of subsystems and behavioral applications may constitute its
being conscious in the access sense

 by contrast even if the
qualitative and phenomenal forms of consciousness involve a highly
unified and densely integrated representation of objective reality it
may be possible to produce representations having those functional
characteristics but which are not qualitative or phenomenal in nature



the fact that in us the modes of representation with those
characteristics also have qualitative and phenomenal properties may
reflect contingent historical facts about the particular design solution
that happened to arise in our evolutionary ancestry

 if so there may be
quite other means of achieving a comparable result without qualitative
or phenomenal consciousness

 whether this is the right way to think
about phenomenal and qualitative conscious is unclear perhaps the tie
to unified and densely integrated representation is in fact as intimate
and constitutive as it seems to be in the case of access consciousness
carruthers 2000

 regardless of how that issue gets resolved it is
important to not to conflate constitution accounts with contingent
realization accounts when addressing the function of consciousness and
answering the question of why it exists chalmers 1996

 theories of consciousness

in response to the what how and why questions many theories of
consciousness have been proposed in recent years

 however not all
theories of consciousness are theories of the same thing

 they vary not
only in the specific sorts of consciousness they take as their object
but also in their theoretical aims



perhaps the largest division is between general metaphysical theories
that aim to locate consciousness in the overall ontological scheme of
reality and more specific theories that offer detailed accounts of its
nature features and role

 the line between the two sorts of theories
blurs a bit especially in so far as many specific theories carry at
least some implicit commitments on the more general metaphysical issues


nonetheless it is useful to keep the division in mind when surveying
the range of current theoretical offerings



8

 metaphysical theories of consciousness

general metaphysical theories offer answers to the conscious version of
the mindbody problem “what is the ontological status of consciousness
relative to the world of physical reality

” the available responses
largely parallel the standard mindbody options including the main
versions of dualism and physicalism



8

1 dualist theories

dualist theories regard at least some aspects of consciousness as
falling outside the realm of the physicalbut specific forms of dualism
differ in just which aspects those are

 see the entry on dualism



substance dualism such as traditional cartesian dualism descartes
1644 asserts the existence of both physical and nonphysical
substances

 such theories entail the existence of nonphysical minds or
selves as entities in which consciousness inheres

 though substance
dualism is at present largely out of favor it does have some
contemporary proponents swinburne 1986 foster 1989 1996



property dualism in its several versions enjoys a greater level of
current support

 all such theories assert the existence of conscious
properties that are neither identical with nor reducible to physical
properties but which may nonetheless be instantiated by the very same
things that instantiate physical properties

 in that respect they might
be classified as dual aspect theories

 they take some parts of
reality—organisms brains neural states or processes—to instantiate
properties of two distinct and disjoint sorts physical ones and
conscious phenomenal or qualitative ones

 dual aspect or property
dualist theories can be of at least three different types



fundamental property dualism regards conscious mental properties as
basic constituents of reality on a par with fundamental physical
properties such as electromagnetic charge

 they may interact in causal
and lawlike ways with other fundamental properties such as those of
physics but ontologically their existence is not dependent upon nor
derivative from any other properties chalmers 1996



emergent property dualism treats conscious properties as arising from
complex organizations of physical constituents but as doing so in a
radical way such that the emergent result is something over and above
its physical causes and is not a priori predictable from nor explicable
in terms of their strictly physical natures

 the coherence of such
emergent views has been challenged kim 1998 but they have supporters
hasker 1999



neutral monist property dualism treats both conscious mental properties
and physical properties as in some way dependent upon and derivative
from a more basic level of reality that in itself is neither mental nor
physical russell 1927 strawson 1994

 however if one takes dualism to
be a claim about there being two distinct realms of fundamental entities
or properties then perhaps neutral monism should not be classified as a
version of property dualism in so far as it does not regard either
mental or physical properties as ultimate or fundamental



panpsychism might be regarded as a fourth type of property dualism in
that it regards all the constituents of reality as having some psychic
or at least protopsychic properties distinct from whatever physical
properties they may have nagel 1979

 indeed neutral monism might be
consistently combined with some version of panprotopsychism chalmers
1996 according to which the protomental aspects of microconstituents
can give rise under suitable conditions of combination to full blown
consciousness

 see the entry on panpsychism



the nature of the relevant protopsychic aspect remains unclear and
such theories face a dilemma if offered in hope of answering the hard
problem

 either the protopsychic properties involve the sort of
qualitative phenomenal feel that generates the hard problem or they do
not

 if they do it is difficult to understand how they could possibly
occur as ubiquitous properties of reality

 how could an electron or a
quark have any such experiential feel

 however if the protopsychic
properties do not involve any such feel it is not clear how they are
any better able than physical properties to account for qualitative
consciousness in solving the hard problem



a more modest form of panpsychism has been advocated by the
neuroscientist giulio tononi 2008 and endorsed by other
neuroscientists including christof koch 2012

 this version derives
from tononi s integrated information theory iit of consciousness that
identifies consciousness with integrated information which can exist in
many degrees see section 9

6 below

 according to iit even a simple
indicator device such as a single photo diode possesses some degree of
integrated information and thus some limited degree of consciousness a
consequence which both tononi and koch embrace as a form of panpsychism



a variety of arguments have been given in favor of dualist and other
antiphysicalist theories of consciousness

 some are largelya priori in
nature such as those that appeal to the supposed conceivability of
zombies kirk 1970 chalmers 1996 or versions of the knowledge argument
jackson 1982 1986 which aim to reach an antiphysicalist conclusion
about the ontology of consciousness from the apparent limits on our
ability to fully understand the qualitative aspects of conscious
experience through thirdperson physical accounts of the brain
processes

 see jackson 1998 2004 for a contrary view see also entries
on zombies and qualia the knowledge argument

 other arguments for
dualism are made on more empirical grounds such as those that appeal to
supposed causal gaps in the chains of physical causation in the brain
eccles and popper 1977 or those based on alleged anomalies in the
temporal order of conscious awareness libet 1982 1985

 dualist
arguments of both sorts have been much disputed by physicalists p

s


churchland 1981 dennett and kinsbourne 1992



8

2 physicalist theories

most other metaphysical theories of consciousness are versions of
physicalism of one familiar sort or another



eliminativist theories reductively deny the existence of consciousness
or at least the existence of some of its commonly accepted sorts or
features

 see the entry on eliminative materialism

 the radical
eliminativists reject the very notion of consciousness as muddled or
wrong headed and claim that the consciousnonconscious distinction fails
to cut mental reality at its joints wilkes 1984 1988

 they regard the
idea of consciousness as sufficiently off target to merit elimination
and replacement by other concepts and distinctions more reflective of
the true nature of mind p

 s

 churchland 1983



most eliminativists are more qualified in their negative assessment


rather than rejecting the notion outright they take issue only with
some of the prominent features that it is commonly thought to involve
such as qualia dennett 1990 carruthers 2000 the conscious self
dennett 1992 or the so called “cartesian theater” where the temporal
sequence of conscious experience gets internally projected dennett and
kinsbourne 1992

 more modest eliminativists like dennett thus
typically combine their qualified denials with a positive theory of
those aspects of consciousness they take as real such as the multiple
drafts model section 9

3 below



identity theory at least strict psychophysical typetype identity
theory offers another strongly reductive option by identifying
conscious mental properties states and processes with physical ones
most typically of a neural or neurophysiological nature

 if having a
qualitative conscious experience of phenomenal red just is being in a
brain state with the relevant neurophysiological properties then such
experiential properties are real but their reality is a straight
forwardly physical reality



typetype identity theory is so called because it identifies mental and
physical types or properties on a par with identifying the property of
being water with the property of being composed of h₂o molecules

 after
a brief period of popularity in the early days of contemporary
physicalism during the 1950s and 60s place 1956 smart 1959 it has
been far less widely held because of problems such as the multiple
realization objection according to which mental properties are more
abstract and thus capable of being realized by many diverse underlying
structural or chemical substrates fodor 1974 hellman and thompson
1975

 if one and the same conscious property can be realized by
different neurophysiological or even nonneurophysiological properties
in different organisms then the two properties can not be strictly
identical



nonetheless the typetype identity theory has enjoyed a recent if modest
resurgence at least with respect to qualia or qualitative conscious
properties

 this has been in part because treating the relevant
psychophysical link as an identity is thought by some to offer a way of
dissolving the explanatory gap problem hill and mclaughlin 1998
papineau 1995 2003

 they argue that if the conscious qualitative
property and the neural property are identical then there is no need to
explain how the latter causes or gives rise to the former

 it does not
cause it it is it

 and thus there is no gap to bridge and no further
explanation is needed

 identities are not the sort of thing that can be
explained since nothing is identical with anything but itself and it
makes no sense to ask why something is identical with itself



however others contend that the appeal to typetype identity does not
so obviously void the need for explanation levine 2001

 even if two
descriptions or concepts in fact refer to one and the same property one
may still reasonably expect some explanation of that convergence some
account of how they pick out one and the same thing despite not
initially or intuitively seeming to do so

 in other cases of empirically
discovered property identities such as that of heat and kinetic energy
there is a story to be told that explains the coreferential
convergence and it seems fair to expect the same in the psychophysical
case

 thus appealing to typetype identities may not in itself suffice
to dissolve the explanatory gap problem



most physicalist theories of consciousness are neither eliminativist nor
based on strict typetype identities

 they acknowledge the reality of
consciousness but aim to locate it within the physical world on the
basis of some psychophysical relation short of strict property
identity



among the common variants are those that take conscious reality to
supervene on the physical be composed of the physical or be realized
by the physical



functionalist theories in particular rely heavily on the notion of
realization to explicate the relation between consciousness and the
physical

 according to functionalism a state or process counts as being
of a given mental or conscious type in virtue of the functional role it
plays within a suitably organized system block 1980a

 a given physical
state realizes the relevant conscious mental type by playing the
appropriate role within the larger physical system that contains it


see the entry on functionalism

 the functionalist often appeals to
analogies with other interlevel relations as between the biological
and biochemical or the chemical and the atomic

 in each case properties
or facts at one level are realized by complex interactions between items
at an underlying level



critics of functionalism often deny that consciousness can be adequately
explicated in functional terms block 1980a 1980b levine 1983
chalmers 1996

 according to such critics consciousness may have
interesting functional characteristics but its nature is not essentially
functional

 such claims are sometimes supported by appeal to the
supposed possibility of absent or inverted qualia i

e

 the possibility
of beings who are functionally equivalent to normal humans but who have
reversed qualia or none at all

 the status of such possibilities is
controversial shoemaker 1981 dennett 1990 carruthers 2000 but if
accepted they would seem to pose a problem for the functionalist

 see
the entry on qualia



those who ground ontological physicalism on the realization relation
often combine it with a nonreductive view at the conceptual or
representational level that stresses the autonomy of the special
sciences and the distinct modes of description and cognitive access they
provide



nonreductive physicalism of this sort denies that the theoretical and
conceptual resources appropriate and adequate for dealing with facts at
the level of the underlying substrate or realization level must be
adequate as well for dealing with those at the realized level putnam
1975 boyd 1980

 as noted above in response to the how question one
can believe that all economic facts are physically realized without
thinking that the resources of the physical sciences provide all the
cognitive and conceptual tools we need for doing economics fodor 1974



nonreductive physicalism has been challenged for its alleged failure to
“pay its physicalist dues” in reductive coin

 it is faulted for
supposedly not giving an adequate account of how conscious properties
are or could be realized by underlying neural physical or functional
structures or processes kim 1987 1998

 indeed it has been charged
with incoherence because of its attempt to combine a claim of physical
realization with the denial of the ability to spell out that relation in
a strict and a priori intelligible way jackson 2004



however as noted above in discussion of the how question nonreductive
physicalists reply by agreeing that some account of psychophysical
realization is indeed needed but adding that the relevant account may
fall far short of a priori deducibility yet still suffice to satisfy
our legitimate explanatory demands mcginn 1991 van gulick 1985

 the
issue remains under debate

 specific theories of consciousness

although there are many general metaphysicalontological theories of
consciousness the list of specific detailed theories about its nature
is even longer and more diverse

 no brief survey could be close to
comprehensive but seven main types of theories may help to indicate the
basic range of options higherorder theories representational
theories interpretative narrative theories cognitive theories neural
theories quantum theories and nonphysical theories

 the categories are
not mutually exclusive for example many cognitive theories also
propose a neural substrate for the relevant cognitive processes


nonetheless grouping them in the seven classes provides a basic
overview

1 higherorder theories

higherorder ho theories analyze the notion of a conscious mental
state in terms of reflexive metamental selfawareness

 the core idea is
that what makes a mental state m a conscious mental state is the fact
that it is accompanied by a simultaneous and noninferential
higherorder i

e

 metamental state whose content is that one is now
in m

 having a conscious desire for some chocolate involves being in two
mental states one must have both a desire for some chocolate and also a
higherorder state whose content is that one is now having just such a
desire

 unconscious mental states are unconscious precisely in that we
lack the relevant higherorder states about them

 their being
unconscious consists in the fact that we are not reflexively and
directly aware of being in them

 see the entry on higherorder theories
of consciousness



higherorder theories come in two main variants that differ concerning
the psychological mode of the relevant consciousmaking metamental
states

 higherorder thought hot theories take the required
higherorder state to be an assertoric thoughtlike metastate
rosenthal 1986 1993

 higherorder perception hop theories take them
to be more perceptionlike and associated with a kind of inner sense and
intramental monitoring systems of some sort armstrong 1981 lycan
1987 1996



each has its relative strengths and problems

 hot theorists note that we
have no organs of inner sense and claim that we experience no sensory
qualities other than those presented to us by outer directed perception


hop theorists on the other hand can argue that their view explains some
of the additional conditions required by ho accounts as natural
consequences of the perceptionlike nature of the relevant higherorder
states

 in particular the demands that the consciousmaking metastate
be noninferential and simultaneous with its lower level mental object
might be explained by the parallel conditions that typically apply to
perception

 we perceive what is happening now and we do so in a way
that involves no inferences at least not any explicit personallevel
inferences

 those conditions are no less necessary on the hot view but
are left unexplained by it which might seem to give some explanatory
advantage to the hop model lycan 2004 van gulick 2000 though some
hot theorists argue otherwise carruthers 2000



whatever their respective merits both hop and hot theories face some
common challenges including what might be called thegenerality problem


having a thought or perception of a given item x—be it a rock a pen or
a potato—does not in general make x a conscious x

 seeing or thinking of
the potato on the counter does not make it a conscious potato

 why then
should having a thought or perception of a given desire or a memory make
it a conscious desire or memory dretske 1995 byrne 1997

 nor will it
suffice to note that we do not apply the term “conscious” to rocks or
pens that we perceive or think of but only to mental states that we
perceive or think of lycan 1997 rosenthal 1997

 that may be true but
what is needed is some account of why it is appropriate to do so



the higherorder view is most obviously relevant to the metamental
forms of consciousness but some of its supporters take it to explain
other types of consciousness as well including the more subjective what
it s like and qualitative types

 one common strategy is to analyze
qualia as mental features that are capable of occurring unconsciously
for example they might be explained as properties of inner states whose
structured similarity relations given rise to beliefs about objective
similarities in the world shoemaker 1975 1990

 though unconscious
qualia can play that functional role there need be nothing that it is
like to be in a state that has them nelkin 1989 rosenthal 1991 1997


according to the ho theorist whatit slikeness enters only when we
become aware of that firstorder state and its qualitative properties by
having an appropriate metastate directed at it



critics of the ho view have disputed that account and some have argued
that the notion of unconscious qualia on which it relies is incoherent
papineau 2002

 whether or not such proposed ho accounts of qualia are
successful it is important to note that most ho advocates take
themselves to be offering a comprehensive theory of consciousness or at
least the core of such a general theory rather than merely one limited
to some special metamental forms of it



other variants of ho theory go beyond the standard hot and hop versions
including some that analyze consciousness in terms of dispositional
rather than occurrent higherorder thoughts carruthers 2000

 others
appeal to implicit rather than explicit higherorder understanding and
weaken or remove the standard assumption that the metastate must be
distinct and separate from its lowerorder object gennaro 1995 van
gulick 2000 2004 with such views overlapping with so called reflexive
theories discussed in the section

 other variants of ho theory continue
to be offered and debate between supporters and critics of the basic
approach remains active

 see the recent papers in gennaro 2004



9

2 reflexive theories

reflexive theories like higherorder theories imply a strong link
between consciousness and selfawareness

 they differ in that they
locate the aspect of selfawareness directly within the conscious state
itself rather than in a distinct metastate directed at it

 the idea
that conscious states involve a double intentionality goes back at least
to brentano 1874 in the 19th century

 the conscious state is
intentionally directed at an object outside itself—such as a tree or
chair in the case of a conscious perception—as well as intentionally
directed at itself

 one and the same state is both an outerdirected
awareness and an awareness of itself

 several recent theories have
claimed that such reflexive awareness is a central feature of conscious
mental states

 some view themselves as variants of higherorder theory
gennaro 2004 2012 while others reject the higherorder category and
describe their theories as presenting a “sameorder” account of
consciousness as selfawareness kriegel 2009

 yet others challenge the
level distinction by analyzing the metaintentional content as implicit
in the phenomenal firstorder content of conscious states as in so
called higherorder global state models hogs van gulick 20042006

 a
sample of papers some supporting and some attacking the reflexive view
can be found in krigel and williford 2006

3 representationalist theories

almost all theories of consciousness regard it as having
representational features but so called representationalist theories
are defined by the stronger view that its representational features
exhaust its mental features harman 1990 tye 1995 2000

 according to
the representationalist conscious mental states have no mental
properties other than their representational properties

 thus two
conscious or experiential states that share all their representational
properties will not differ in any mental respect



the exact force of the claim depends on how one interprets the idea of
being “representationally the same” for which there are many plausible
alternative criteria

 one could define it coarsely in terms of
satisfaction or truth conditions but understood in that way the
representationalist thesis seems clearly false

 there are too many ways
in which states might share their satisfaction or truth conditions yet
differ mentally including those that concern their mode of
conceptualizing or presenting those conditions



at the opposite extreme one could count two states as
representationally distinct if they differed in any features that played
a role in their representational function or operation

 on such a
liberal reading any differences in the bearers of content would count as
representational differences even if they bore the same intentional or
representational content they might differ only in their means or mode
of representation not their content



such a reading would of course increase the plausibility of the claim
that a conscious state s representational properties exhaust its mental
properties but at the cost of significantly weakening or even
trivializing the thesis

 thus the representationalist seems to need an
interpretation of representational sameness that goes beyond mere
satisfaction conditions and reflects all the intentional or contentful
aspects of representation without being sensitive to mere differences in
underlying noncontentful features of the processes at the realization
level

 thus most representationalists provide conditions for conscious
experience that include both a content condition plus some further
causal role or format requirements tye 1995 dretske 1995 carruthers
2000

 other representationalists accept the existence of qualia but
treat them as objective properties that external objects are represented
as having i

e

 they treat them as represented properties rather than
as properties of representations or mental states dretske 1995 lycan
1996



representationalism can be understood as a qualified form of
eliminativism insofar as it denies the existence of properties of a sort
that conscious mental states are commonly thought to have—or at least
seem to have—namely those that are mental but not representational


qualia at least if understood as intrinsic monadic properties of
conscious states accessible to introspection would seem to be the most
obvious targets for such elimination

 indeed part of the motivation for
representationalism is to show that one can accommodate all the facts
about consciousness perhaps within a physicalist framework without
needing to find room for qualia or any other apparently
nonrepresentational mental properties dennett 1990 lycan 1996
carruthers 2000



representationalism has been quite popular in recent years and had many
defenders but it remains highly controversial and intuitions clash
about key cases and thought experiments block 1996

 in particular the
possibility of inverted qualia provides a crucial test case

 to
antirepresentationalists the mere logical possibility of inverted
qualia shows that conscious states can differ in a significant mental
respect while coinciding representationally

 representationalists in
reply deny either the possibility of such inversion or its alleged
import dretske 1995 tye 2000



many other arguments have been made for and against representationalism
such as those concerning perceptions in different sense modalities of
one and the same state of affairs—seeing and feeling the same cube—which
might seem to involve mental differences distinct from how the relevant
states represent the world to be peacocke 1983 tye 2003

 in each
case both sides can muster strong intuitions and argumentative
ingenuity

 lively debate continues

4 narrative interpretative theories

some theories of consciousness stress the interpretative nature of facts
about consciousness

 according to such views what is or is not
conscious is not always a determinate fact or at least not so
independent of a larger context of interpretative judgments

 the most
prominent philosophical example is the multiple drafts model mdm of
consciousness advanced by daniel dennett 1991

 it combines elements
of both representationalism and higherorder theory but does so in a way
that varies interestingly from the more standard versions of either
providing a more interpretational and less strongly realist view of
consciousness



the mdm includes many distinct but interrelated features

 its name
reflects the fact that at any given moment content fixations of many
sorts are occurring throughout the brain

 what makes some of these
contents conscious is not that they occur in a privileged spatial or
functional location—the so called “cartesian theater”—nor in a special
mode or format all of which the mdm denies

 rather it a matter of what
dennett calls “cerebral celebrity” i

e

 the degree to which a given
content influences the future development of other contents throughout
the brain especially with regard to how those effects are manifest in
the reports and behaviors that the person makes in response to various
probes that might indicate her conscious state

 one of the mdm s key
claims is that different probes e

 g

 being asked different questions
or being in different contexts that make differing behavioral demands
may elicit different answers about the person s conscious state


moreover according to the mdm there may be no probeindependent fact of
the matter about what the person s conscious state really was

 hence the
“multiple” of the multiple drafts model



the mdm is representationalist in that it analyzes consciousness in
terms of content relations

 it also denies the existence of qualia and
thus rejects any attempt to distinguish conscious states from
nonconscious states by their presence

 it rejects as well the notion of
the self as an inner observer whether located in the cartesian theater
or elsewhere

 the mdm treats the self as an emergent or virtual aspect
of the coherent roughly serially narrative that is constructed through
the interactive play of contents in the system

 many of those contents
are bound together at the intentional level as perceptions or fixations
from a relatively unified and temporally extended point of view i

e


they cohere in their contents as if they were the experiences of a
ongoing self

 but it is the order of dependence that is crucial to the
mdm account

 the relevant contents are not unified because they are all
observed by a single self but just the converse

 it is because they are
unified and coherent at the level of content that they count as the
experiences of a single self at least of a single virtual self



it is in this respect that the mdm shares some elements with
higherorder theories

 the contents that compose the serial narrative
are at least implicitly those of an ongoing if virtual self and it is
they that are most likely to be expressed in the reports the person
makes of her conscious state in response to various probes

 they thus
involve a certain degree of reflexivity or selfawareness of the sort
that is central to higherorder theories but the higherorder aspect is
more an implicit feature of the stream of contents rather than present
in distinct explicit higherorder states of the sort found in standard
ho theories



dennett s mdm has been highly influential but has also drawn criticism
especially from those who find it insufficiently realist in its view of
consciousness and at best incomplete in achieving its stated goal to
fully explain it block 1994 dretske 1994 levine 1994

 many of its
critics acknowledge the insight and value of the mdm but deny that
there are no real facts of consciousness other than those captured by it
rosenthal 1994 van gulick 1994 akins 1996



from a more empirical perspective the neuroscientist michael gazzaniga
2011 has introduced the idea of an “interpreter module” based in the
left hemisphere that makes sense of our actions in any inferential way
and constructs an ongoing narrative of our actions and experience


though the theory is not intended as a complete theory of consciousness
it accords a major role to such interpretative narrative activity

5 cognitive theories

a number theories of consciousness associate it with a distinct
cognitive architecture or with a special pattern of activity with that
structure



global workspace

 a major psychological example of the cognitive
approach is the global workspace theory

 as initially developed by
bernard baars 1988 global workspace theory describes consciousness in
terms of a competition among processors and outputs for a limited
capacity resource that “broadcasts” information for widespread access
and use

 being available in that way to the global workspace makes
information conscious at least in the access sense

 it is available for
report and the flexible control of behavior

 much like dennett s
“cerebral celebrity” being broadcast in the workspace makes contents
more accessible and influential with respect to other contents and other
processors

 at the same time the original content is strengthened by
recurrent support back from the workspace and from other contents with
which it coheres

 the capacity limits on the workspace correspond to the
limits typically placed on focal attention or working memory in many
cognitive models



the model has been further developed with proposed connections to
particular neural and functional brain systems by stanislas dehaene and
others 2000

 of special importance is the claim that consciousness in
both the access and phenomenal sense occurs when and only when the
relevant content enters the larger global network involving both primary
sensory areas as well as many other areas including frontal and parietal
areas associated with attention

 dehaene claims that conscious
perception begins only with the “ignition” of that larger global
network activity in the primary sensory areas will not suffice no
matter how intense or recurrent though see the contrary view of victor
lamme in section 9

attended intermediate representation

 another cognitive theory is jesse
prinz s 2012 attended intermediate level representation theory air


the theory is a neurocognitive hybrid account of conscious

 according
to air theory a conscious perception must meet both cognitive and
neural conditions

 it must be a representation of a perceptually
intermediate property which prinz argues are the only properties of
which we are aware in conscious experience—we experience only basic
features of external objects such as colors shapes tones and feels


according to prinz our awareness of higher level properties—such as
being a pine tree or my car keys—is wholly a matter of judging and not
of conscious experience

 hence the intermediate representational ir
aspect of air

 to be conscious such a represented content must also be
attended the a aspect of air

 prinz proposes a particular neural
substrate for each component

 he identifies the intermediate level
representations with gamma 40–80hz vector activity in sensory cortex
and the attentional component with synchronized oscillations that can
incorporate that gamma vector activity



9

6 information integration theory

the integration of information from many sources is an important feature
of consciousness and as noted above section 6

4 is often cited as
one of its major functions

 content integration plays an important role
in various theories especially global workspace theory section 9

3


however a proposal by the neuroscientist giulio tononi 2008 goes
further in identifying consciousness with integrated information and
asserting that information integration of the relevant sort is both
necessary and sufficient for consciousness regardless of the substrate
in which it is realized which need not be neural or biological


according to tononi s integrated information theory iit consciousness
is a purely informationtheoretic property of systems

 he proposes a
mathematical measure φ that aims to measure not merely the information
in the parts of a given system but also the information contained in the
organization of the system over and above that in its parts

 φ thus
corresponds to the system s degree of informational integration

 such a
system can contain many overlapping complexes and the complex with the
highest φ value will be conscious according to iit



according to iit consciousness varies in quantity and comes in many
degrees which correspond to φ values

 thus even a simple system such a
single photo diode will be conscious to some degree if it is not
contained within a larger complex

 in that sense iit implies a form of
panpsychism that tononi explicitly endorses

 according to iit the
quality of the relevant consciousness is determined by the totality of
informational relations within the relevant integrated complex

 thus iit
aims to explain both the quantity and quality of phenomenal
consciousness

 other neuroscientists notably christof koch have also
endorsed the iit approach koch 2012

7 neural theories

neural theories of consciousness come in many forms though most in some
way concern the so called “neural correlates of consciousness” or nccs


unless one is a dualist or other nonphysicalist more than mere
correlation is required at least some nccs must be the essential
substrates of consciousness

 an explanatory neural theory needs to
explain why or how the relevant correlations exist and if the theory is
committed to physicalism that will require showing how the underlying
neural substrates could be identical with their neural correlates or at
least realize them by satisfying the required roles or conditions
metzinger 2000



such theories are diverse not only in the neural processes or properties
to which they appeal but also in the aspects of consciousness they take
as their respective explananda

 some are based on highlevel systemic
features of the brain but others focus on more specific physiological
or structural properties with corresponding differences in their
intended explanatory targets

 most in some way aim to connect with
theories of consciousness at other levels of description such as
cognitive representational or higherorder theories



a sampling of recent neural theories might include models that appeal to
global integrated fields kinsbourne binding through synchronous
oscillation singer 1999 crick and koch 1990 nmdamediated transient
neural assemblies flohr 1995 thalamically modulated patterns of
cortical activation llinas 2001 reentrant cortical loops edelman
1989 comparator mechanisms that engage in continuous
actionpredictionassessment loops between frontal and midbrain areas
gray 1995 left hemisphere based interpretative processes gazzaniga
1988 and emotive somatosensory hemostatic processes based in the
frontallimbic nexus damasio 1999 or in the periaqueductal gray
panksepp 1998



in each case the aim is to explain how organization and activity at the
relevant neural level could underlie one or another major type or
feature of consciousness

 global fields or transient synchronous
assemblies could underlie the intentional unity of phenomenal
consciousness

 nmdabased plasticity specific thalamic projections into
the cortex or regular oscillatory waves could all contribute to the
formation of short term but widespread neural patterns or regularities
needed to knit integrated conscious experience out of the local activity
in diverse specialized brain modules

 left hemisphere interpretative
processes could provide a basis for narrative forms of conscious
selfawareness

 thus it is possible for multiple distinct neural
theories to all be true with each contributing some partial
understanding of the links between conscious mentality in its diverse
forms and the active brain at its many levels of complex organization
and structure



one particular recent controversy has concerned the issue of whether
global or merely local recurrent activity is sufficient for phenomenal
consciousness

 supporters of the global neuronal workspace model
dehaene 2000 have argued that consciousness of any sort can occur only
when contents are activated with a large scale pattern of recurrent
activity involving frontal and parietal areas as well as primary sensory
areas of cortex

 others in particular the psychologist victor lamme
2006 and the philosopher ned block 2007 have argued that local
recurrent activity between higher and lower areas within sensory cortex
e

g

 with visual cortex can suffice for phenomenal consciousness even
in the absence of verbal reportability and other indicators of access
consciousness

8 quantum theories

other physical theories have gone beyond the neural and placed the
natural locus of consciousness at a far more fundamental level in
particular at the microphysical level of quantum phenomena

 according
to such theories the nature and basis of consciousness can not be
adequately understood within the framework of classical physics but must
be sought within the alternative picture of physical reality provided by
quantum mechanics

 the proponents of the quantum consciousness approach
regard the radically alternative and often counterintuitive nature of
quantum physics as just what is needed to overcome the supposed
explanatory obstacles that confront more standard attempts to bridge the
psychophysical gap



again there are a wide range of specific theories and models that have
been proposed appealing to a variety of quantum phenomena to explain a
diversity of features of consciousness

 it would be impossible to
catalog them here or even explain in any substantial way the key
features of quantum mechanics to which they appeal

 however a brief
selective survey may provide a sense however partial and obscure of
the options that have been proposed



the physicist roger penrose 1989 1994 and the anesthesiologist stuart
hameroff 1998 have championed a model according to which consciousness
arises through quantum effects occurring within subcellular structures
internal to neurons known as microtubules

 the model posits so called
“objective collapses” which involve the quantum system moving from a
superposition of multiple possible states to a single definite state
but without the intervention of an observer or measurement as in most
quantum mechanical models

 according to the penrose and hameroff the
environment internal to the microtubules is especially suitable for such
objective collapses and the resulting selfcollapses produce a coherent
flow regulating neuronal activity and making nonalgorithmic mental
processes possible



the psychiatrist ian marshall has offered a model that aims to explain
the coherent unity of consciousness by appeal to the production within
the brain of a physical state akin to that of a boseeinstein
condensate

 the latter is a quantum phenomenon in which a collection of
atoms acts as a single coherent entity and the distinction between
discrete atoms is lost

 while brain states are not literally examples of
boseeinstein condensates reasons have been offered to show why brains
are likely to give rise to states that are capable of exhibiting a
similar coherence marshall and zohar 1990



a basis for consciousness has also been sought in the holistic nature of
quantum mechanics and the phenomenon of entanglement according to which
particles that have interacted continue to have their natures depend
upon each other even after their separation

 unsurprisingly these models
have been targeted especially at explaining the coherence of
consciousness but they have also been invoked as a more general
challenge to the atomistic conception of traditional physics according
to which the properties of wholes are to be explained by appeal to the
properties of their parts plus their mode of combination a method of
explanation that might be regarded as unsuccessful to date in explaining
consciousness silberstein 1998 2001



others have taken quantum mechanics to indicate that consciousness is an
absolutely fundamental property of physical reality one that needs to
be brought in at the very most basic level stapp 1993

 they have
appealed especially to the role of the observer in the collapse of the
wave function i

e

 the collapse of quantum reality from a
superposition of possible states to a single definite state when a
measurement is made

 such models may or may not embrace a form of
quasiidealism in which the very existence of physical reality depends
upon its being consciously observed



there are many other quantum models of consciousness to be found in the
literature—some advocating a radically revisionist metaphysics and
others not—but these four provide a reasonable though partial sample
of the alternatives



9

9 nonphysical theories

most specific theories of consciousness—whether cognitive neural or
quantum mechanical—aim to explain or model consciousness as a natural
feature of the physical world

 however those who reject a physicalist
ontology of consciousness must find ways of modeling it as a nonphysical
aspect of reality

 thus those who adopt a dualist or antiphysicalist
metaphysical view must in the end provide specific models of
consciousness different from the five types above

 both substance
dualists and property dualists must develop the details of their
theories in ways that articulate the specific natures of the relevant
nonphysical features of reality with which they equate consciousness or
to which they appeal in order to explain it



a variety of such models have been proposed including the following


david chalmers 1996 has offered an admittedly speculative version of
panpsychism which appeals to the notion of information not only to
explain psychophysical invariances between phenomenal and physically
realized information spaces but also to possibly explain the ontology of
the physical as itself derived from the informational a version of “it
from bit” theory

 in a somewhat similar vein gregg rosenberg has
2004 proposed an account of consciousness that simultaneously
addresses the ultimate categorical basis of causal relations

 in both
the causal case and the conscious case rosenberg argues the
relationalfunctional facts must ultimately depend upon a categorical
nonrelational base and he offers a model according to which causal
relations and qualitative phenomenal facts both depend upon the same
base

 also as noted just above section 9

8 some quantum theories
treat consciousness as a fundamental feature of reality stapp 1993
and insofar as they do so they might be plausibly classified as
nonphysical theories as well



10

 conclusion

a comprehensive understanding of consciousness will likely require
theories of many types

 one might usefully and without contradiction
accept a diversity of models that each in their own way aim respectively
to explain the physical neural cognitive functional representational
and higherorder aspects of consciousness

 there is unlikely to be any
single theoretical perspective that suffices for explaining all the
features of consciousness that we wish to understand

 thus a synthetic
and pluralistic approach may provide the best road to future progress
