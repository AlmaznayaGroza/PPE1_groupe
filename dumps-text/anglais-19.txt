Eating with a Conscience

choose a crop Choosing organic food to protect health and the environment

   Our food choices have a direct effect on the health of our environment
   and those who grow and harvest what we eat.  That’s why food labeled
   "organic" is the right choice. In addition to serious health questions
   linked to actual residues of toxic pesticides on the food we eat, our
   food buying decisions support or reject hazardous agricultural
   practices, protection of farmworkers and farm families, and stewardship
   of the earth.

The Organic Choice is Clear

   It is important to eat organic food—nurtured in a system of food
   production, handling and certification that rejects hazardous synthetic
   chemicals. USDA organic certification is the only system of food
   labeling that is subject to independent public review and oversight,
   assuring consumers that toxic, synthetic pesticides used in
   conventional agriculture are replaced by management practices focused
   on soil biology, biodiversity, and plant health. This eliminates
   commonly used toxic chemicals in the production and processing of food
   that is not labeled organic--pesticides that contaminate our water and
   air, hurt biodiversity, harm farmworkers, and kill bees, birds, fish
   and other wildlife.

Food Choices Based Only on Pesticide Residues Fall Short

   To help explain the urgent need for a major shift to organic food
   consumption, Beyond Pesticides has begun the Eating with a Conscience
   database which evaluates the impacts on the environment and farmworkers
   of the toxic chemicals allowed for use on major food crops, grown
   domestically and internationally. We have started with those foods that
   have been identified widely in the media as “clean.” While the Clean 15
   and Dirty Dozen lists generated by Environmental Working Group is
   helpful in alerting consumers to hazardous residues on food, food
   residues are only part of the story. It turns out that those very same
   “clean” food commodities may be grown with hazardous pesticides that
   get into waterways and groundwater, contaminate nearby communities,
   poison farmworkers, and kill wildlife, while not all showing up at
   detectable levels on our food.

Choosing Organic: For you, the environment, and workers

   Eating with a Conscience looks at the toxic chemicals that are allowed
   in the production of the food we eat and the environmental and public
   health effects resulting from their use.

   Choose a fruit or vegetable.
