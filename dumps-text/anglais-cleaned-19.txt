key points

 the ambiguous nature of conscience is welldramatized in mark
 twain s huckleberry finn


 according to hemingway we should trust our authentic feelings
 rather than what we ve absorbed unconsciously from our family and
 culture


 what s morally ideal and what s possible can at times be worlds
 apart—as is the gulf between what people aspire to and what they re
 capable of


 from an ecclesiastical perspective an evil conscience is synonymous
 with sinning against god and one must pay penance to be forgiven



tumisupixabay

source tumisupixabay

few novelists have captured the ultimate ambiguity of conscience better
than mark twain did in huckleberry finn

 jim the escaped slave who
accompanies huck down the river on a raft is on a journey to reunite
with his beloved family whom white people have separated from him

 in
several scenes huck beset with guilt for not handing jim over to the
authorities as his conscience naggingly instructs him to anguishes over
his default role as an escapee s accomplice



finally subconsciously recognizing jim not only as the devoted
concerned father figure he never had but in many ways as a paragon of
virtue despite the color of his skin huck decides to disobey his
conscience

 in doing so he demonstrates the courage many literary
critics have cited as constituting the novel s moral climax

 i was atrembling because i d got to decide forever betwixt two
 things and i knowed it

 i studied a minute sort of holding my
 breath and then says to myself alright then i ll go to hell



in addition note these two later passages which also explain
indirectly why twain would have readers question the racist messages
endemic to a prejudicial society

 it don t make no difference whether you do right or wrong a person s
 conscience ain t got no sense and just goes for him anyway



but because huck isn t yet mature or freethinking enough to triumph
over the cultural bias of the culture that s educated him he s
compelled to rationalize his decision to protect jim through some
curious verbal gymnastics namely

 i knowed he jim was white inside



to employ freud s terminology huck is coming from his id doing what by
nature he s drawn to do while forcefully resisting the strong
gravitational pull of his guiltinducing superego

 but when these brief
excerpts are explored in the context of twain s general handling of
whites in the novel it s obvious that as traditionally understood
twain has interchanged id and superego



metaphorically that is the connotations of whiteness are quite
black—and black ironically has been transposed with white

 what twain
characterizes is that a slave can exemplify all that s most admirable in
humanity while the purportedly most lilywhite individuals may
indeed illustrate the reverse



for huck to act conscientiously by denying jim his personal
freedom—which despite tremendous personal risks jim so desperately
seeks because of his dedication to his wife and children—would be to
mirror his society s corrupted conscience

 huck s safeguarding of jim
from all the people who d prefer primarily for ignoble reasons to
return him to slavery can be comprehended as depicting a true versus an
artificial culturallyderived conscience



ernest hemingway deeply influenced by twain s plainspoken style and
exemplifying a similar interest in discovering how best to distinguish
between virtuous and villainous behavior offers this realitybased
solution in death in the afternoon

 what is moral is what you feel good after and what is immoral is what
 you feel bad after



here too we re presented with an idealistically pragmatic perspective
deviating from the far more conventional morals or mores of society


hemingway s position is that deciding how to evaluate the ethical
ramifications of behavior ought to be based on personal realityderived
sentiment

 it s a matter of trusting one s authentic feelings rather
than what one has absorbed unconsciously both from how their family
raised them and the moral consensus of their culture



ethics and morality essential reads



becoming a better person takes time



the mental health struggles of veterinary technicians

writers worldwide have historically questioned popular assumptions about
the fixed nature of good and evil

 so these two authors can be seen as
representative of so many writers who came to regard accepted
definitions of morality as simplistic—and frequently false



defining conscience from a religious perspective

let s now look at customary definitions of conscience to illustrate how
they stop short of accounting for the many ambiguities so often found in
reality for what s ideal and what s practically possible can at times
be worlds apart—as can the gulf between what people aspire to and what
they re actually capable of



the literature online relating particularly to the oxymoronic concept of
an evil conscience emanates mostly from theology—and we ll deal with
this orientation first

 the approach that fundamentalist religion takes
toward ethics is absolutist placing a person s behavior into neat
generally unqualified categories

 for example in a sermon marshaling
all of its supporting evidence from scriptures greg stuckey defines any
human wrongdoing as—purely and simply—evil

 so anyone afflicted with
such a presumed immoral conscience will experience as good what the
bible delineates as evil and vice versa



defining such people as sociopathic though without employing this
secular terminology stuckey posits that they glory in and brag about
precisely what they should be ashamed of

 rather than feeling troubled
by hurting others they perversely take joy in it

 looked at from this
dogmatic ecclesiastical stance an evil conscience is synonymous with
sinning against god—and it requires paying penance to god if one is to
be forgiven



in my next post i ll explore this seminal topic from a secular point of
view and also explore the curious moral ambiguity of the superego

 and
my final post on this subject will get into the moral rationalizations
people offer for bad behavior which they can t—or won t—own up to
