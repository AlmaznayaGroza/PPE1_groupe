critical consciousness conscientization or conscientização in
portuguese 

portuguese pronunciation kõsjẽtʃizaˈsɐ̃w is a popular education and
social concept developed by brazilian pedagogue and educational theorist
paulo freire grounded in neomarxist critical theory

 critical
consciousness focuses on achieving an indepth understanding of the
world allowing for the perception and exposure of social and political
contradictions

 critical consciousness also includes taking action
against the oppressive elements in one s life that are illuminated by
that understanding

1

coinage

edit

the english term conscientization is a translation of the portuguese
term conscientização which is also translated as consciousness
raising and critical consciousness

 the term was popularized by
brazilian educator activist and theorist paulo freire in his 1970 work
pedagogy of the oppressed

 freire was teaching the poor and illiterate
members of brazilian society to read at a time when literacy was a
requirement for suffrage and dictators ruled many south american
countries

 the term originally derives from frantz fanon s coinage of a
french term conscientiser in his 1952 book black skins white
masks

overview

edit

paulo freire defines critical consciousness as the ability to intervene
in reality in order to change it

3 critical consciousness proceeds
through the identification of generative themes which freire
identifies as iconic representations that have a powerful emotional
impact in the daily lives of learners

 in this way individual
consciousness helps end the culture of silence in which the socially
dispossessed internalize the negative images of themselves created and
propagated by the oppressor in situations of extreme poverty

 liberating
learners from this mimicry of the powerful and from the fratricidal
violence that results therefrom is a major goal of critical
consciousness

 critical consciousness is a fundamental aspect of
freire s concept of popular education



arlene goldbard an author on the subject of community cultural
development finds the concept of conscientization to be a foundation of
community cultural development

 from the glossary of goldbard s 2006
book new creative community conscientization is an ongoing process by
which a learner moves toward critical consciousness

 this process is the
heart of liberatory education

 it differs from consciousness raising
in that the latter may involve transmission of preselected knowledge


conscientization means engaging in praxis in which one both reflects
and takes action on their social reality to break through prevailing
mythologies and reach new levels of awareness—in particular awareness
of oppression being an object of others will rather than a
selfdetermining subject

 the process of conscientization involves
identifying contradictions in experience through dialogue and becoming
part of the process of changing the world

history of application

edit

the ancient greeks first identified the essence of critical
consciousness when philosophers encouraged their students to develop an
impulse and willingness to stand back from humanity and nature





 and
to make them objects of thought and criticism and to search for their
meaning and significance

5 in his books pedagogy of the
oppressed6 and education for critical consciousness3 freire
explains critical consciousness as a sociopolitical educative tool that
engages learners in questioning the nature of their historical and
social situation which freire addressed as reading the world

 the
goal of critical consciousness according to freire should be acting as
subjects in the creation of democratic society

 in education freire
implies intergenerational equity between students and teachers in which
both learn both question both reflect and both participate in
meaningmaking

 using this idea and describing current instructional
methods as homogenization and lockstep standardization alternative
approaches are proposed such as the sudbury model an alternative
approach in which children by enjoying personal freedom thus encouraged
to exercise personal responsibility for their actions learn at their
own pace rather than following a previously imposed
chronologicallybased curriculum

789 in a similar form students
learn all the subjects techniques and skills in these schools

 the
staff are minor actors the teacher is an adviser and helps just when
asked

1011 the sudbury model maintains that values social
justice critical consciousness intergenerational equity and political
consciousness included must be learned through
experience12131415 as aristotle said for the things we
have to learn before we can do them we learn by doing them

16

picking up on freire s definition of critical consciousness joe l


kincheloe has expanded the definition of the concept in his work on
postformalism

 in kincheloe s formulation postformalism connects
cognition to critical theoretical questions of power and social justice


in this context kincheloe constructs a critical theory of cognition that
explores questions of meaning emancipation visavis ideological
inscription and a particular focus on the sociopolitical construction
of the self

 with these concerns in mind kincheloe s postformal critical
consciousness engages questions of purpose issues of human dignity
freedom authority reconceptualized notions of reason intellectual
quality and social responsibility

 postformal critical consciousness
stimulates a conversation between critical pedagogy and a wide range of
social cultural political economic psychological and philosophical
concerns

 kincheloe employs this multilogical conversation to shape
new modes of selfawareness more effective forms of social political
and pedagogical action and an elastic model of an evolving critical
consciousness kincheloe and steinberg 1993 kincheloe 1999 thomas
and kincheloe 2006



freire s development of critical consciousness has been expanded upon in
several academic disciplines and common applications

17 public
health community collaborations focused on hiv prevention for
women18 the role of critical consciousness in adult
education19 and the effect of peer pressure on cigarette
smokers20 freire s notion of critical consciousness is in part a
type of political consciousness



in educational programs for youth and adolescents some instructors have
implemented curricula aimed at encouraging students to develop a
critical consciousness within subjectspecific material

21
instructors can teach language arts22 science23 and social
science24 lessons while guiding students to connect academic
material to their experiences explore themes of social justice and
discuss these ideas collaboratively in the classroom



in application raising critical consciousness in young students can
lead to successful outcomes in terms of students socialemotional
wellbeing25 academic performance26 and increased pursuit of
careers after completing high school

2728 while some studies
provide support for developing critical consciousness in students due to
the potential benefits other studies present conflicting results

 for
example research has also shown that students who demonstrate lower
critical consciousness levels may experience less depressed moods29
and higher grades

30 due to limitations associated with the
predominantly qualitative designs of many studies on critical
consciousness in education further research is needed using rigorous
controlled quantitative designs to more clearly understand the
relationship between critical consciousness and young students
