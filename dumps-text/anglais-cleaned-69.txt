Bad
conscience
and
guilt
:
Gaining
understanding
and
treatment

A
guilty
conscience
can
be
a
result
of
various
psychological
mechanisms
.


In
this
article
we
present
an
overview
of
some
of
them
,
what
you
yourself
can
do
and
what
you
can
expect
if
you
contact
us
for
therapy
.

 

We
hope
we
can
contribute
a
step
in
the
right
direction
-
free
from
the
guilt
trap
.

 

No
one
is
perfect
on
every
level
and
everything
can
always
be
handled
better
.


Thus
,
a
feeling
of
guilt
is
unavoidable
for
any
sentient
being
.


But
for
some
it
can
prove
to
be
extra
burdensome
.



In
this
article
,
we

behind

guilty
conscience

A
guilty
conscience
-
an
introduction

A
guilty
conscience
must
be
the
most
misused
of
our
basic
emotions
.


It
is
actually
a
feeling
that
can
help
guide
us
back
to
the
right
path
when
we
have
actually
done
something
wrong
.



But
in
our
time
,
it
is
largely
abused
as
a
tool
for
psychological
warfare
on
ourselves
.



When
we
speak
of
a
guilty
conscience
,
we
must
therefore
immediately
separate
between
healthy
and
unhealthy
feelings
of
guilt
.



We
can
get
a
healthy
feeling
of
guilt
simply
because
we
have
done
something
wrong
.


In
these
instances
,
the
feeling
of
guilt
is
meant
to
help
motivate
us
to
engage
in
reparative
actions
.

 

All
too
often
,
a
temporary
guilty
conscience
is
an
unhealthy
expression
of
self-punishment
.


Often
over
not
being
able
to
meet
impossible
inner
demands
and
expectations
.

 

Imagination
is
the
only
limitation
for
which
parts
of
reality
one
can
abuse
to
keep
oneself
down
.



Bad
conscience
for
having
eaten
,
not
to
mention
eating
candy
or
something
else
unhealthy
,
not
have
trained
,
after
a
breakup
,
to
end
it
,
not
to
stay
in
the
relationship
,
with
your
boyfriend
,
ex
,
children
and
parents
,
not
least
if
they
are
old
.


It
can
happen
if
you
are
ill
,
away
from
work
or
have
infected
others
.


One
may
have
a
bad
conscience
for
saying
no
,
or
for
not
saying
no
.


It
can
also
occur
over
thoughts
and
feelings
one
has
.


In
cohabitation
,
it
can
occur
after
infidelity
,
or
for
lack
of
and
too
much
sex
drive
.



There
is
almost
no
way
,
and
can
be
a
great
challenge
in
everyday
life
.



Trapped
in
the
maelstrom
of
the
spirit
of
the
times
?



How
can
it
have
become
so
common
to
go
around
feeling
like
you
are
never
enough
?


Why
can
'
t
we
give
ourselves
permission
to
be
as
we
are
,
to
just
live
life
in
all
our
human
imperfection
?



Why
can
we
sometimes
see
the
irrationality
of
our
self-accusations
but
still
be
unable
to
shed
the
painful
emotions
?



You
may
have
come
across
various
advice
and
tips
online
already
.


“Tell
yourself
you
are
good
enough”
,
“lower
your
standards”
or
similar
expressions
are
often
employed
.


These
are
completely
right
and
in
some
cases
reminders
such
as
these
can
be
of
help
.


  

But
sometimes
you
may
not
be
aware
that
you
are
driving
yourself
far
too
hard
.


Things
may
have
always
been
this
way
and
you
don’t
even
think
about
it
.



Fish
don’t
believe
in
water
.



In
situations
like
these
,
awareness
and
active
work
with
your
inner
dialogue
can
be
enough
to
create
more
space
within
yourself
.



This
can
be
especially
true
for
those
who
have
a
somewhat
healthy
sense
of
self-esteem
at
their
foundation
but
find
themselves
being
drawn
into
the
“hamster-wheel”
,
stuck
in
time
constraints
and
the
eternal
demands
of
modern
life
.

 

Chronic
guilt
-
for
no
reason
?



In
many
cases
we
find
that
the
problem
goes
deeper
.


A
chronic
guilty
conscience
,
often
for
no
reason
,
is
commonly
linked
with
a
vulnerability
in
an
individual’s
self-esteem
.

 

Rationally
you
can
understand
that
you
are
too
hard
on
yourself
,
but
it
feels
like
you
just
aren
'
t
good
enough
and
should
step
it
up
anyway
.

 

When
things
feel
like
this
there
is
an
emotional
block
in
place
somewhere
,
often
unconsciously
.



In
situations
such
as
these
,
therapy
can
be
helpful
in
getting
to
the
bottom
of
what
the
driving
force
behind
the
difficulties
is
and
attempt
to
weaken
the
inner
mechanisms
of
self-sabotage

Preferably
pulled
up
by
the
root
.



Psychologists
as
early
as
Freud
were
preoccupied
with
the
central
role
an
indeterminate
feeling
of
guilt
can
play
.



Once
such
a
feeling
has
first
entered
the
psyche
,
it
can
become
a
driving
force
for
a
variety
of
symptoms
,
including
anxiety
and
depression
.



The
mind
can
become
preoccupied
with
seeking
out
confirmations
in
everyday
situations
of
such
basic
assumptions
.



Thus
,
chronic
feelings
of
guilt
in
everyday
life
can
begin
not
only
in
the
maelstrom
of
the
times
but
also
in
disturbed
internalized
relational
experiences
from
childhood
.



This
does
not
necessarily
have
to
mean
great
traumas
;
often
the
driving
force
is
a
more
subtle
,
emotional
tension
.



The
child
who
grows
up
with
suffering
around
them
develops
basic
feelings
of
guilt
for
their
own
inability
to
help
.



The
child
who
does
not
have
their
negative
feelings
towards
others
acknowledged
will
still
feel
cruel
and
guilty
and
continue
to
direct
such
feelings
inward
.



Other
times
the
induction
of
guilt
can
occur
via
various
forms
of
conditional
love
,
such
as
high
expectations
and
demands
.



Sometimes
difficulties
with
guilt
can
be
rooted
in
growing
up
with
more
or
less
direct
accusations
,
criticism
and
disapproval
.


Among
other
things
.



One
is
often
unaware
that
such
basic
conditions
can
become
the
driving
force
for
chronic
guilt
,
and
simply
becoming
aware
of
this
can
help
.



Other
times
one
is
aware
but
driven
by
chronic
guilt
just
the
same
.



In
situations
such
as
these
,
emotion-focused
therapy
,
where
you
work
through
layers
of
anxiety
and
guilt-containing
emotions
(especially
repressed
anger
)
can
be
an
effective
means
of
breaking
the
pattern
.



In
our
experience
,
a
lot
of
anxiety
and
guilt
are
connected
to
contradictory
emotions
related
to
figures
central
in
one’s
upbringing
.



In
some
cases
,
adaptation
to
one
'
s
environment
goes
so
far
as
to
become
purely
self-destructive
.



Simply
saying
no
or
having
an
opinion
,
want
,
thought
or
feeling
that
conflicts
with
the
needs
of
others
can
create
a
feeling
of
guilt
.



Then
therapy
with
a
psychologist
can
often
be
necessary
.


If
you
wish
to
give
therapy
for
a
guilty
conscience
a
try
,
you
can
quickly
and
easily
schedule
an
appointment
online
in

minutes

Therapy
for
a
guilty
conscience
with
trained
psychologists
in
Oslo

If
you
at
any
time
want
to
give
therapy
a
go
,
we
will
begin
by
examining
your
problems
as
you
experience
them
here
and
now
and
work
with
concrete
examples
from
your
everyday
life
in
which
guilt
,
or
other
symptoms
,
are
intensified
.



These
concrete
examples
often
carry
within
them
a
larger
narrative
.


We
will
actively
work
to
understand
the
specific
driving
mechanisms
behind
your
symptoms
,
not
least
of
all
the
unconscious
ones
.



Often
through
this
sort
of
work
,
relevant
links
to
the
past
can
come
up
and
when
this
happens
we
work
closely
with
these
as
well
.



We
endeavor
to
not
just
“talk
about
it”
or
“dwell
on
the
past”
but
to
work
actively
to
help
you
form
a
healing
relationship
where
you
can
be
yourself
and
you
can
react
as
an
entire
organism
to
what
you
have
experienced
.



Thus
,
you
can
resolve
eventual
remnants
from
your
past
that
have
gotten
“stuck”
,
become
aware
of
your
patterns
and
achieve
lasting
change
going
forward
.



This
is
how
we
endeavor
to
combine
an
in-depth
psychological
perspective
with
an
active
work
method
.


We
try
not
to
dig
up
the
past
just
for
the
sake
of
it
while
not
just
superficially
skimming
the
surface
.



The
degree
to
which
your
self-liberation
process
is
successful
is
greatly
dependent
on
the
cooperation
we
manage
to
establish
.



Gaining
a
common
understanding
for
the
mechanisms
that
have
led
to
your
difficulties
and
finding
a
helpful
way
to
cooperate
are
our
natural
goals
at
the
start
of
therapy
.

 

You
will
quickly
discover
if
therapy
is
something
for
you
.


Keep
in
mind
that
we
also
offer
video
therapy
right
in
your
own
home
.


It
can
be
worth
trying
.

Tips
for

for
No

a
bunch
of
tips
to
separate

?


Psychological
first
aid
for
those
of
you

done
something
wrong -
This
article
is
primarily
about
cases
where
you
have
actually
done
something
wrong
,
have
guilt
healthy
varietybut
misuse
this
in
order
to
punish
yourself
rather
than
reach
out
to
others
.



Then
you
will
never
be
using
the
healthy
feeling
of
guilt
to
bring
yourself
back
on
the
course
you
want
to
be
on

Rather
,
you
get
“stuck”
in
the
bad
things
you
have
done
and
use
it
to
keep
yourself
down
.



It
is
helpful
to
do
a
team
effort
and
utilize
your
healthy
capacity
for
guilt
.

Feeling
Guilty
About
Everything

Anything
?


This
is
How
to
Break
the
Pattern
of
the
“Blame
Game” This
blog
post
is
about
when
someone
"gives
you"
guilt
.


When
someone
around
you
has
put
you
,
or
is
constantly
putting
you
,
under
pressure
to
take
responsibility
for
things
that
are
not
really
yours
,
and
you
give
in
.

 

Did
you
have
parents
who
constantly
“gave”
you
a
guilty
conscience
?


Either
directly
or
subtly
,
through
accusations
or
hints
about
their
own
pain
?


Someone
around
you
that
constantly
plays
the
role
of
“victim”
?

 

Or
maybe
a
partner
that
has
started
to
pick
on
you
and
criticize
you
daily
?


And
you

Then
this
