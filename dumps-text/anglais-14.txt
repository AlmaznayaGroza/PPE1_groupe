How to Form a Moral Conscience

     *
          +

What is a Moral Conscience?
               According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, a human
            person “has in his heart a law inscribed by God,” “calling him
            to love.”  This is a person’s moral conscience. (#1776)
               In their document Forming Consciences for Faithful
            Citizenship, the U.S. bishops said " Conscience is not
            something that allows us to justify doing whatever we want,
            nor is it a mere ‘feeling’ about what we should or should not
            do. Rather, conscience is the voice of God resounding in the
            human heart, revealing the truth to us and calling us to do
            what is good while shunning what is evil.”
               The moral conscience urges a person “to do good and avoid
            evil;” it also judges particular choices, approving those
            which are good and disapproving those which are evil.
            (Catechism of the Catholic Church, #1777)  Our conscience
            enables us to understand the principles of morality, decide
            how to apply those principles in specific circumstances, and
            judge the moral status of concrete acts. (#1780)
               The human person "has the right to act in conscience and in
            freedom" and “must always obey the certain judgment of his
            conscience.” (#1782, 1790)
               The Catechism says a person’s moral conscience must be
            informed and enlightened so that it “formulates its judgments
            according to reason, [and] in conformity with the true good"
            willed by God. (#1783)  Shaping a well-formed conscience is a
            lifelong task which is rooted in the Word of God, assisted by
            the gifts of the Holy Spirit, aided by the witness or advice
            of others, and guided by the authoritative teaching of the
            Church.(#1784-1785).
               Ignorance of Christ and his Gospel, bad example by others,
            enslavement to one's passions, a mistaken notion of autonomy,
            rejection of the Church's authority or teaching, lack of
            conversion or charity may all be a source of errors in moral
            judgment.  "One must therefore work to correct the errors of
            moral conscience." (1792, 1793)
               The Catechism says that individuals are “sometimes
            confronted by situations that make moral judgments less
            assured and decision difficult.”  In such situations, a person
            “must always seriously seek what is right and good and discern
            the will of God expressed in divine law.”(#1787)  In this
            effort, a person “strives to interpret the data of experience
            and the signs of the times” with the assistance of “the virtue
            of prudence, … the advice of competent people, and … the help
            of the Holy Spirit….”(#1788)

How to Form a Moral Conscience
            Here are some guidelines for how to form a moral conscience,
            particul-arly in a situation where you may misunderstand or
            disagree with a specific truth or teaching of the Church:
            • Consult with a pastor, pastoral staff member or spiritual
            guide who understands and can explain the Church's teaching
            clearly and correctly.  Identify the fundamental truths or
            values on which this teaching is based and determine how
            essential this teaching is to the core of Catholic faith.
            Beware of making decisions based on information you read in
            books or online which may not accurately explain the Church's
            teaching.
            • Assume that the Church's understanding of God's revelation
            and human nature is fuller, deeper and more reliable than any
            individual's.
            Even though the Church's teaching may seem ideal, unrealistic
            or wrong to you, start from the assumption that it is correct
            and applies to your personal circumstances.

            • Evaluate your personal opinions, feelings and circumstances
            carefully.  Honestly assess the reasons why you are unable or
            unwilling to agree or comply with the Church's teaching.
            This is best done with the assistance of an trusted companion
            such as a pastor, confessor or spiritual guide who understands
            the Church's teaching as well as your personal circumstances.
            • Pray for the grace to understand and appreciate the
            underlying truth or values which are reflected in the Church's
            teaching and for the grace to discern what is possible for you
            in your particular circumstances.
            Be patient, and allow time for God's inspiration to guide you
            directly or through others who know and love you.
            • Consult with your pastor, a confessor or reliable spiritual
            guide before making a final decision.  The goal here is to
            determine to what extent you can or cannot understand or
            follow the Church's teaching.  To what extent is it possible
            to honor the teaching in part?  To what extent is it possible
            to honor the underlying truth or value which is reflected in
            the teaching?
            • Continue to pray for the grace to understand or comply with
            the Church's teaching more fully, in spite of your personal
            circumstances.  Pray for the grace to appreciate and honor the
            underlying truth or value reflected in a particular teaching.
            Be open to changing your decision as your understanding or
            circumstances change.
            • Consult with your pastor, a confessor or reliable spiritual
            guide if you are troubled by your decision.
            • Remember that God knows you are an imperfect and sinful
            person and loves you nonetheless.
            Trust in God's mercy and love even if, after careful
            discernment, your decision does not agree with the Church's
            teaching.
            If we decide that we cannot understand or comply completely
            with the Church's teaching, we should avoid coming to the
            conclusion that the Church must be wrong.  Although at times
            prophetic individuals and groups within the Church come to
            different conclusions which the Church officially accepts at a
            later date, most of us are not prophets.
            If we are led by a morally responsible conscience to believe
            or act in a way which is contrary to what the Church teaches
            at the present time, we should continue to assume that the
            Church is correct and that for more or less legitimate reasons
            I am unable or unwilling to agree or comply.  We should
            continue to participate as fully as possible in the
            sacramental and spiritual life of the Catholic Church, being
            careful not to give scandal to others who may be confused by
            our belief or behavior.
            If we are led by a morally responsible conscience to believe
            or act in a way which is contrary to what the Church teaches
            at the present time, we should do so with a spirit of humility
            and respect, a desire to remain in communion with the Catholic
            faith community, and the intention to believe and obey as
            fully as possible in what the Church believes and teaches.
            We should proceed cautiously and with patience, aware of our
            own limitations and sinfulness, always desiring to be
            transformed by God's love and mercy.
