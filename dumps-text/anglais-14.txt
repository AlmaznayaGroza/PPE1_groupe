 How to Form a Moral Conscience 

-   

    -   

         

        What is a Moral Conscience?

           According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, a human
        person “has in his heart a law inscribed by God,” “calling him
        to love.”  This is a person’s moral conscience. (#1776)

           In their document Forming Consciences for Faithful
        Citizenship, the U.S. bishops said " Conscience is not something
        that allows us to justify doing whatever we want, nor is it a
        mere ‘feeling’ about what we should or should not do. Rather,
        conscience is the voice of God resounding in the human heart,
        revealing the truth to us and calling us to do what is good
        while shunning what is evil.”
           The moral conscience urges a person “to do good and avoid
        evil;” it also judges particular choices, approving those which
        are good and disapproving those which are evil. (Catechism of
        the Catholic Church, #1777)  Our conscience enables us to
        understand the principles of morality, decide how to apply those
        principles in specific circumstances, and judge the moral status
        of concrete acts. (#1780)
           The human person "has the right to act in conscience and in
        freedom" and “must always obey the certain judgment of his
        conscience.” (#1782, 1790)
           The Catechism says a person’s moral conscience must be
        informed and enlightened so that it “formulates its judgments
        according to reason, [and] in conformity with the true good"
        willed by God. (#1783)  Shaping a well-formed conscience is a
        lifelong task which is rooted in the Word of God, assisted by
        the gifts of the Holy Spirit, aided by the witness or advice of
        others, and guided by the authoritative teaching of the
        Church.(#1784-1785).
           Ignorance of Christ and his Gospel, bad example by others,
        enslavement to one's passions, a mistaken notion of autonomy,
        rejection of the Church's authority or teaching, lack of
        conversion or charity may all be a source of errors in moral
        judgment.  "One must therefore work to correct the errors of
        moral conscience." (1792, 1793)
           The Catechism says that individuals are “sometimes confronted
        by situations that make moral judgments less assured and
        decision difficult.”  In such situations, a person “must always
        seriously seek what is right and good and discern the will of
        God expressed in divine law.”(#1787)  In this effort, a person
        “strives to interpret the data of experience and the signs of
        the times” with the assistance of “the virtue of prudence, … the
        advice of competent people, and … the help of the Holy
        Spirit….”(#1788)

        How to Form a Moral Conscience

        Here are some guidelines for how to form a moral conscience,
        particul-arly in a situation where you may misunderstand or
        disagree with a specific truth or teaching of the Church:
        • Consult with a pastor, pastoral staff member or spiritual
        guide who understands and can explain the Church's teaching
        clearly and correctly.  Identify the fundamental truths or
        values on which this teaching is based and determine how
        essential this teaching is to the core of Catholic faith.
        Beware of making decisions based on information you read in
        books or online which may not accurately explain the Church's
        teaching.
        • Assume that the Church's understanding of God's revelation and
        human nature is fuller, deeper and more reliable than any
        individual's.
        Even though the Church's teaching may seem ideal, unrealistic or
        wrong to you, start from the assumption that it is correct and
        applies to your personal circumstances.
          
        • Evaluate your personal opinions, feelings and circumstances
        carefully.  Honestly assess the reasons why you are unable or
        unwilling to agree or comply with the Church's teaching.  
        This is best done with the assistance of an trusted companion
        such as a pastor, confessor or spiritual guide who understands
        the Church's teaching as well as your personal circumstances.
        • Pray for the grace to understand and appreciate the underlying
        truth or values which are reflected in the Church's teaching and
        for the grace to discern what is possible for you in your
        particular circumstances.
        Be patient, and allow time for God's inspiration to guide you
        directly or through others who know and love you.
        • Consult with your pastor, a confessor or reliable spiritual
        guide before making a final decision.  The goal here is to
        determine to what extent you can or cannot understand or follow
        the Church's teaching.  To what extent is it possible to honor
        the teaching in part?  To what extent is it possible to honor
        the underlying truth or value which is reflected in the
        teaching?
        • Continue to pray for the grace to understand or comply with
        the Church's teaching more fully, in spite of your personal
        circumstances.  Pray for the grace to appreciate and honor the
        underlying truth or value reflected in a particular teaching.
        Be open to changing your decision as your understanding or
        circumstances change.
        • Consult with your pastor, a confessor or reliable spiritual
        guide if you are troubled by your decision.
        • Remember that God knows you are an imperfect and sinful person
        and loves you nonetheless.  
        Trust in God's mercy and love even if, after careful
        discernment, your decision does not agree with the Church's
        teaching.
        If we decide that we cannot understand or comply completely with
        the Church's teaching, we should avoid coming to the conclusion
        that the Church must be wrong.  Although at times prophetic
        individuals and groups within the Church come to different
        conclusions which the Church officially accepts at a later date,
        most of us are not prophets.
        If we are led by a morally responsible conscience to believe or
        act in a way which is contrary to what the Church teaches at the
        present time, we should continue to assume that the Church is
        correct and that for more or less legitimate reasons I am unable
        or unwilling to agree or comply.  We should continue to
        participate as fully as possible in the sacramental and
        spiritual life of the Catholic Church, being careful not to give
        scandal to others who may be confused by our belief or behavior.
        If we are led by a morally responsible conscience to believe or
        act in a way which is contrary to what the Church teaches at the
        present time, we should do so with a spirit of humility and
        respect, a desire to remain in communion with the Catholic faith
        community, and the intention to believe and obey as fully as
        possible in what the Church believes and teaches.
        We should proceed cautiously and with patience, aware of our own
        limitations and sinfulness, always desiring to be transformed by
        God's love and mercy.
