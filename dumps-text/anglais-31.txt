[Spartan Christianity]

The Evil Conscience

  “Let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith,
  having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our
  bodies washed with pure water.”

  Hebrews 10:22

How could this be? A conscience that is evil? The traditionalists are
going to faint when they hear about this! Could it be that there is such
a thing as a conscience that directs man to do what is evil instead of
what is good? Absolutely. Just as it is possible to have a broken
compass that points east instead of north.

The Old Testament talks about men whose hearts desired nothing but evil
continually (Genesis 6:5). These men were later annihilated by the
flood. Think about Sodom and Gomorrah: do you think those guys were
interested in doing what was right based on their conscience? They were
only interested in sex with any man or woman they could find. Don’t be
surprised, this is what the heart, mind and conscience of man can
degenerate into. 

The conscience of man can be such that instead of leading you to do what
is right, it leads you to do what is evil. Again, like the Seared
Conscience, you can either develop an evil conscience or be born with
it. The difference between the seared and evil conscience is that a
seared conscience is devoid of guilt or without regret from doing what
is wrong, or the conscience itself is silent; an evil conscience,
however, directs the heart of man towards evil instead of good, doing
the opposite of what a normal, functioning conscience would do. 

In theory: A good conscience keeps us from doing wrong because it is a voice within that directs us towards the right action.

An evil conscience desires for us to do what is wrong constantly, and because of this desire, there is no guilt associated with committing whatever evil deed your heart desires. 

You would be surprised to hear that such a conscience is actually quite
prevalent in the Church. Because it is easy to do evil and still walk
into the assembly like there is nothing wrong. This is popular at highly
liberal churches, which I tend to call “Adulterer’s Haven” churches,
because many of them ignore the teachings of Christ on divorce and
remarriage and allow anyone with an unscriptural marriage to enter their
assembly. 

An evil conscience will keep you sinning and give you no reason to
change. All the popular  tools of change endorsed by the Church
(Guilt/Shame/Conscience/Fear) have been taken out of your toolbelt.
According to them, you will not be able to progress. Without an
overwhelming sense of guilt, how will you change? 

This statement gives you a bird’s eye view into their ignorance of the
subject. No emotion is necessary for change to occur, even though
emotions can help on the path of change. However, guilt is uncommon for
men, as it tends to be primarily a female emotion or one experienced by
weak beta-males. 

Men, you must grow, train, progress and improve with or without emotional help.

Few modern men know this. You aren’t going to feel like going to work
every day, no one does, but you go anyway. No one is going to feel like
working out every day, but you do it anyways. No man is going to feel
like listening to and loving their wife every day, but they do it.

Men take action regardless of how they feel at the time. Regardless of
all emotion, men must press on and do what is right. They must work,
improve, train and move towards being the fully formed and functional
men they need to be. Reject the weak man’s idea of conscience, embrace
the rigid strength of discipline unaltered by feeling.

Mantra

Reject conscience, embrace action.

Application

If you have an evil conscience, you must do the opposite of what your
conscience tells you to do. It is as simple as that. If your conscience
is evil, it is pulling you towards evil action, so you must resist your
conscience and oppose it in order to do what is right. Again, it does
not matter if you feel like doing what is right, or if you want to, or
what your motivation is, it only matters if you do what is right or not.
What are your actions? They can be good or evil regardless of what kind
of conscience you have. 

Again, and at risk of being overly redundant, reject the idea of the
necessity of conscience. 

Conscience is a tool to be used for change, but change is possible
without this tool. This is a principle fact of life. You must do what is
right regardless of emotional states, including the emotional state of a
conscience. You must focus and take action. Do what is right. Be a Man.

Conduct Yourselves Like Men.
