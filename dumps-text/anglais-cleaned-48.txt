[Waking
class
consciousness
today]

 

How
woke
is
the
U
.

S
.


working
class
?


The
good
news
:
A
recent
study
suggests
that
millennials
are
more
likely
than
previous
generations
to
self-identify
as
working
class
.


The
bad
news
:
In
the
2016
presidential
election
,
41%
of
voters
with
a
family
income
under
$50
,000
voted
for
Trump
.



The
working
class
can’t
be
blamed
for
Trump’s
victory
.


But
more
than
4
in
10
voters
with
a
family
income
under
$50
,000
voted
for
a
man
who
promised
to
repeal
the
Affordable
Care
Act
.


This
fact
alone
shows
that
the
working
class
is
not
woke
enough
.


Raising
class
consciousness
should
be
a
top
priority
for
left
activists
,
and
we
need
more
ways
to
do
it
.



First
,
let’s
examine
the
terminology
.


What’s
“working
class”
?


To
most
people
in
the
U
.

S
.


,
the
term
indicates
an
income
bracket
:
currently
,
families
making
less
than
$38
,000
.



To
some
,
it’s
a
cultural
marker
that
refers
only
to
people
with
blue
collar
jobs
.


To
others
,
including
many
millennials
,
the
phrase
means
failure
:
the
failure
to
make
it
into
the
middle
class
.


It
is
a
negative
identification
,
one
that
says
,
“I
thought
I’d
be
better
off
by
now
.

”

All
three
of
these
misunderstandings
work
against
wokeness
.




Class
is
wholly
determined
by
one’s
structural
position
within
a
given
economic
system

For
Marxists
,
class
is
not
defined
by
income
,
type
of
job
,
or
degree
of
success
.


Class
is
wholly
determined
by
one’s
structural
position
within
a
given
economic
system
;
specifically
,
one’s
relation
to
the
means
of
production
.


If
you
do
not
own
the
means
of
production—if
you
depend
on
wages
or
a
salary—you
belong
to
the
working
class
.


If
you
do
own
the
means
of
production
,
you
belong
to
the
capitalist
class
.


Income
and
wealth
are
not
decisive
factors
.


The
dividing
line
between
workers
and
capitalists
is
drawn
on
the
basis
of
shared
economic
interests
.


It’s
in
the
interests
of
the
capitalists
to
make
and
keep
as
much
property
,
profit
and
power
as
possible
.


It’s
in
the
interests
of
the
workers
for
all
power
and
resources
to
be
shared
.



But
many
working-class
people
have
been
taught
to
misunderstand
their
real
economic
interests
.


On
the
basis
of
this
misunderstanding
,
they
mistake
the
capitalists
for
their
allies
,
and
vote
against
themselves
.



One
of
our
best
weapons
in
fighting
such
misunderstandings
is
our
ability
to
analyze
ideology
.


In
a
major
contribution
to
Western
thought
,
Marx
revealed
that
prevailing
beliefs
and
values
,
which
we
mistake
for
timeless
truths
,
are
actually
“ideology
.

”
That
is
,
they
are
historically
specific
products
that
support
the
status
quo
.


A
precept
as
simple
and
seemingly
obvious
as
“thou
shalt
not
steal”
supports
certain
assumptions
about
property
rights
and
ownership
,
the
status
of
things
under
capitalism
.


One
can
imagine
a
different
society
whose
precept
would
be
,
“thou
shalt
share
.

”
We
don’t
live
in
that
one
.



[]

Marx
,
and
the
20th-century
Marxist
philosopher
Louis
Althusser
,
emphasized
that
ideology
is
not
the
intentional
product
of
a
few
conspirators
.


The
system
of
beliefs
and
behaviors
encompassed
by
the
term
“ideology”
is
much
too
large
and
complex
to
be
produced
and
controlled
by
any
group
of
individuals
.


Rather
,
ideology
is
like
an
ecosystem
in
which
we
all
live
.


It
works
to
blind
everyone
to
the
social
inequalities
and
class
politics
that
underlie
our
successes
,
failures
,
privileges
,
and
limitations
.


The
capitalists
are
fooled
into
believing
that
the
wealth
and
power
they’ve
acquired
is
rightfully
theirs
.


So
are
the
workers
.



In
a
brilliant
essay
on
ideologyAlthusser
points
out
that
in
every
generation
,
the
conditions
of
production
must
be
reproduced
.


Worn
out
tools
and
machinery
must
be
replaced
,
software
upgraded
and
so
on
,
but
also
the
workforce
must
be
replaced
.


Workers
must
be
taught
techniques
and
skills
,
but
more
importantly
,
they
must
be
taught
“respect
for
rules
of
the
order
established
by
class
domination
.

” 
For
example
,
each
child
must
learn
that
the
United
States
has
the
best
economic
system
ever
;
if
people
are
poor
it’s
their
own
fault
,
and
anyway
the
system
is
impossible
to
change
.


Such
beliefs
keep
people
docilely
joining
the
status
quo
.




We
learn
and
re-learn
the
rules
through
many
channels

It’s
not
just
schools
that
teach
such
ideological
rules
and
reward
us
for
accepting
them
.


We
learn
and
re-learn
the
rules
through
many
channels
,
including
mass
media
,
culture
(literature
,
the
arts
,
sports)
,
the
family
,
social
groups
,
religious
institutions
.


Althusser
calls
these
“Ideological
State
Apparatuses”
(ISAs)
.


They
are
supposed
to
work
together
to
perpetuate
beliefs
and
behaviors
that
reproduce
existing
distribution
of
wealth
and
power
.


But
they
do
so
very
quietly
and
subtly
.


The
system
works
best
if
we
believe
we
are
freely
choosing
,
making
up
our
own
minds
,
not
being
forced
into
something
.



Ironically
,
the
people
who
truly
believe
that
America
is
the
land
of
freedom
and
free
choice
have
been
the
most
effectively
subjected
to
ISAs
.


Their
minds
have
been
molded
to
regard
this
idea
as
a
simple
truth
,
even
though
their
own
firsthand
experience
contradicts
it
.


Such
examples
hint
at
the
power
of
ideology
.



Althusser
differentiates
ISAs
,
which
operate
subtly
,
from
a
different
type
of
power
,
the
“Repressive
State
Apparatus
.

”
Repressive
power
consists
of
government
,
police
,
army
,
courts
,
and
prisons
;
it
functions
by
violence
and
forcible
,
visible
repression
or
coercion
.


It
is
completely
controlled
by
the
ruling
class
,
except
in
a
time
of
revolution
,
and
functions
as
backup
when
ISAs
fail
.


For
example
,
schools
teach
students
that
our
criminal
justice
system
is
fair
and
unbiased
.


But
if
the
students
do
not
learn
right
and
take
to
the
streets
to
protest
dramatic
racial
injustice
,
they
can
be
arrested
by
the
police
and
sent
to
jail
.



Yet
the
fact
that
such
things
do
happen
demonstrates
that
the
ISAs
are
fallible
.


They
never
work
perfectly
to
support
the
capitalist
status
quo
.


Some
people
are
woke
,
able
to
think
critically
about
the
messages
the
ISAs
are
sending
and
offer
opposing
views
.


They
keep
the
ISAs
from
forming
one
big
happy
brainwasher
,
and
make
them
into
a
complicated
,
ever-shifting
set
of
battlefields
.



The
ISAs
,
then
,
are
not
something
we
fight
against
,
but
something
we
fight
within
.


They
are
sites
of
struggle
because
,
as
Althusser
puts
it
,
“former
ruling
classes
are
able
to
retain
strong
positions
there
for
a
long
time
,
but
also
because
the
resistance
of
the
exploited
classes
is
able
to
find
means
and
occasions
to
express
itself
there
,
either
by
the
utilization
of
their
contradictions
,
or
by
conquering
combat
positions
in
them
in
struggle
.

”

Consider
the
example
of
music
.


If
you
press
“scan”
on
your
car
radio
,
you
might
hear
a
Beethoven
symphony
that
was
once
used
to
distinguish
the
educated
aristocracy
from
the
upstart
bourgeoise
factory
owner
.


Then
comes
a
Top
40
station
with
its
love
songs
and
laments
,
all
stressing
that
one
should
focus
on
private
life
and
forget
about
politics
.


Another
station
plays
Springsteen
,
Bob
Dylan
,
and
Aretha
Franklin
,
past
anthems
of
social
protest
now
coated
in
nostalgia
,
though
they
still
bear
witness
to
the
anger
that
bore
them
.


Then
you
might
hit
a
college
station
playing
new
protest
music
:
Mona
Haydar
,
Chicano
Batman
,
M
.

I
.

A
.


As
Althusser
put
it
,
the
ISAs
are
“not
only
the
stake
but
also
the
site
of
class
struggle
.

”

Over
the
past
decade
,
progressive
forces
have
made
great
use
of
television
,
presenting
strong
positive
images
of
women
,
people
of
color
,
differently
abled
,
gay
,
lesbian
,
or
trans
.


These
fictional
characters
have
had
a
huge
impact
,
helping
drive
some
conservative
ideological
forces
into
retreat
.


Though
difficult
to
prove
,
it
seems
very
likely
that
the
shows
have
helped
bring
about
material
change
,
such
as
the
legalization
of
gay
marriage
.


Unfortunately
,
class
struggle
has
been
less
widely
portrayed
on
TV
.


As
access
to
production
and
distribution
mechanisms
opens
up
,
activists
should
seize
opportunities
to
create
representations
that
further
class
consciousness
.


We
can
also
draw
attention
to
images
that
do
exist
and
help
people
interpret
their
meaning
.




Not
all
revolutionary
battles
happen
in
the
realm
of
ideology

Granted
,
not
all
revolutionary
battles
happen
in
the
realm
of
ideology
.


Material
struggles
over
economic
structures
and
political
power
are
ultimately
more
important
.


But
raising
class
consciousness
means
finding
allies
so
that
material
struggles
can
be
waged
and
won
.


We
need
to
identify
spaces
within
ideology
where
working-class
identity
is
being
contested
,
and
devise
interventions
.


Ideological
struggles
are
dynamic
and
fluid
.


Images
that
were
derogatory
can
be
appropriated
as
symbols
of
power
,
or
vice
versa
.


An
important
site
of
struggle
may
suddenly
become
irrelevant
.


Therefore
,
ideological
analysis
always
has
to
be
done
anew
,
for
the
here
and
now
.



Right
now
,
a
very
dangerous
ideological
battle
is
being
fought
over
what
it
means
to
be
a
white
working-class
man
.


Trump
and
his
allies
have
shaped
an
enticing
fantasy
for
this
particular
population
,
promising
to
restore
their
lost
economic
and
social
power
by
taking
back
the
rights
of
Others
(women
,
ethnic
and
religious
minorities
,
immigrants
,
the
LGBTQ
community)
.


Of
course
,
working-class
men
never
had
economic
or
social
power
.


That
doesn’t
stop
the
enemy
from
representing
it
as
lost
,
stolen
.


In
this
fight
,
the
far
right
portrays
race
,
religion
,
gender
,
and
sexuality
as
decisive
dividing
lines
,
blocking
any
perception
of
shared
interests
based
on
class
.



The
left
has
relied
heavily
on
critique
to
fight
back
.


Critique
is
important
:
we
must
expose
lies
and
reveal
contradictions
.


But
it
isn’t
enough
.


Now
more
than
ever
,
the
working
class
needs
positive
ideals
,
competing
representations
that
position
working-class
identity
as
attractive
and
embraceable
.


Communists
and
socialists
actually
have
positive
ideals
to
offer
,
a
great
advantage
over
our
liberal
allies
.


We
need
to
use
this
advantage
to
maximum
effect
.


Fight
back
by
presenting
images
and
stories
of
alliances
based
on
class
.


Look
for
opportunities
to
redirect
ideological
assertions
.


Their
rhetoric
promotes
the
belief
that
white
men
have
been
robbed
of
power
and
relevance
.


Our
rhetoric
promotes
belief
in
an
inclusive
future
that
will
be
more
rewarding
for
everyone
.


They
tell
a
story
of
lost
power
and
create
opportunities
for
the
violent
expression
of
rage
and
hatred
.


We
tell
a
story
of
exciting
discovery
,
and
create
opportunities
to
learn
from
and
respect
each
other
.



[]

One
way
of
creating
such
opportunities
was
developed
by
the
women’s
movement
in
the
1970s
.


At
that
time
,
it
was
common
for
women
not
to
feel
solidarity
with
other
women
,
and
not
to
accept
that
sexism
was
real
.


Feminists
brought
women
together
in
“consciousness
raising”
groups
to
share
their
experiences
.


“I
have
never
been
subjected
to
sexism
,”
a
woman
might
say
.


“I
do
have
varicose
veins
from
wearing
high
heels
,
a
husband
who
does
no
housework
and
ridicules
the
books
I
like
,
and
a
minimum
wage
job
at
a
day
care
.


But
those
things
are
just
my
own
individual
life
choices
.

”
As
women
listened
to
other
women
,
they
began
to
see
their
common
experiences
as
products
of
an
oppressive
system
.


At
the
same
time
,
fellowship
and
camaraderie
with
other
women
made
the
identification
rewarding
:
“Sisterhood
is
a
warm
feeling
!

”
This
affirmation
re-defined
what
it
meant
to
be
a
woman
,
changing
the
affective
value
of
the
identification
from
something
demeaning
to
something
positive
and
celebrated
.




Strong
working-class
identification
provides
the
unifying
factor
that
makes
other
aspects
of
identity
a
matter
of
diversity

The
same
method
might
work
to
raise
class
consciousness
.


In
a
diverse
group
,
facilitators
could
ask
whether
participants
have
ever
been
injured
at
work
,
whether
they
are
able
to
save
money
,
take
time
off
for
family
,
own
a
house
or
pay
for
college
without
debt
,
and
also
whether
their
bosses
can
do
these
things
;
what
percentage
of
revenue
the
company
would
lose
without
the
worker
,
and
how
this
compares
to
the
worker’s
wages
;
whether
the
boss
deserves
to
have
more
money
and
power
,
etc
.


Questions
that
might
seem
demeaning
in
an
individual
conversation
have
a
different
effect
in
a
cohort
group
,
where
the
pleasures
of
solidarity
can
make
working-class
identification
rewarding
.


The
answers
people
say
and
hear
will
validate
firsthand
experience
,
allowing
the
representation
of
firsthand
experience
to
gain
power
over
false
ideological
precepts
.


(“Wait
a
minute
!


That’s
not
right
.


That’s
not
fair
.

”)

Such
groups
can
lead
participants
to
see
class
similarities
across
racial
and
ethnic
divides
.


This
requires
an
upstream
paddle
against
the
many
enticements
of
ideological
forces
urging
us
to
understand
ourselves
in
other
ways
,
ways
that
divide
the
working
class
but
may
be
more
attached
to
privilege
or
at
least
to
pride
,
community
and
belonging
.


But
again
,
the
widespread
failure
of
people
to
identify
themselves
in
a
primary
sense
as
workers
,
having
interests
in
common
with
all
other
workers
,
is
a
major
obstacle
to
progress
.


Class
identification
does
not
preclude
others
(ethnicity
,
gender
,
sexual
orientation
,
age
,
profession
,
etc
.

)
.


But
a
strong
working-class
identification
provides
the
unifying
factor
that
makes
other
aspects
of
identity
a
matter
of
diversity
rather
than
division
.



In
the
past
,
Marxists
embraced
a
simpler
opposition
between
capitalist
ideology
and
workers’
material
reality
,
or
truth
.


Ideology
was
the
enemy
and
truth
was
the
weapon
.


But
life
in
the
21st
century
is
fully
soaked
in
representations
,
and
representations
are
always
ideological
.


It
is
no
longer
possible
,
if
it
ever
was
,
to
separate
reality
from
ideology
.


We
can’t
simply
pop
ourselves
out
of
the
tight
network
of
images
and
practices
,
hopes
and
fears
that
keep
people
believing
,
for
example
,
that
we
all
have
an
equal
shot
at
the
top
.


To
contest
this
imaginary
relationship
to
an
exploitative
reality
,
we
have
to
work
within
the
network
,
using
the
tools
it
provides
.


Class
struggle
against
pro-capitalist
ideological
forces
must
take
place
within
ideology
.


In
addition
to
critique
,
we
need
positive
representations
of
working-class
identity
to
raise
class
consciousness
and
compete
with
the
far
right
.
