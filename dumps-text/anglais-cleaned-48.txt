key points

 consciousness is the active and subjective experiencing aspect of an
 experience


 consciousness is what transforms a biochemical state into an
 experience


 although we have mapped brain activity to specific conscious
 perceptions we still don t know how this gives rise to conscious
 experiences



consciousness is what we are most familiar with

 feeling the sun s
warmth on our face the joy of seeing someone we love or the thrill of
being on a rollercoaster—every single experience we ever had from
sensations to thoughts and emotions is linked to consciousness

 it
seems paradoxical but despite being at the centre of every experience
consciousness is difficult to define and still poorly understood
scientifically



we know more about distant galaxies and the deepest ocean regions than
we do about our consciousness

 even though consciousness has been
discussed by philosophers for millennia and has become an active and
thriving field of scientific research it remains largely a mystery–but
a strange mystery one that we may not understand well but are
intimately acquainted with



so what exactly is consciousness

 many have tried to answer this
seemingly simple question i will cover most of the influential views on
this blog but a universally agreedupon definition still seems
elusive

 let s start our exploration with a trip to the dentist



experiencing an experience

local anesthesia can make dental surgery a lot more bearable


specialised neurons that detect pain called nociceptors still respond
even when under local anesthesia and try to send out signals to alert
the brain to tissue damage inside the mouth

 while some local
anesthetics reduce nociceptor activity many function by blocking these
signals from being passed on so that the message never reaches the brain
another example of this is spinal epidural anesthesia where the
signaling pathway is blocked in the spinal cord rather than at the
source nociceptors olschewski et al

 1998

 the tissue damage in the
mouth is simply a biological state and any nociceptor response is just
a biochemical reaction an event or an occurrence without any
associated experience



when we bite into a juicy apple after recovering from our dental
surgery our minds cannot directly interact with the apple

 whatever
the mind may be it cannot directly taste the sweetness sense the
crunchy texture or smell the chemicals released into the air

 we need
the complex sensory machinery inside our bodies to pick up on these
things encode them into neural signals and send them to the brain


when the upward signaling is interrupted like it was by the local
anesthesia at the dentist all of this is merely a physiological state
or a unique biochemical configuration of our bodies



however if these signals reach our brains when awake and focused
something extraordinary happens the biological signals trigger a
subjective conscious experience

 we still don t know much about how or
why this happens but consciousness lives on as an indisputable aspect
of our minds

 although mysterious it is also one of the most beautiful
and meaningful aspects of our human experience it makes life worth
living and gives us an innate sense of value and worth

 there are no
laws against throwing a rock but very strict laws against throwing rocks
at a human being



the simple reason is that unlike rocks—as far as we know—human beings
have the capacity to experience both pain and joy

 all human rights and
the famous unalienable right to life liberty and the pursuit of
happiness found in the u

s

 declaration of independence are based on
the human capacity to have experiences

 consciousness is the basis for
our experiences and undergirds all of this



in its most basic sense consciousness is linked to experience

 in a
way it turns a state of the world or a specific configuration of atoms
molecules organs and everything else into an experience

 another way
to look at it is as the active experiencing of an experience

behind our outer façade lies a rich inner world based on conscious
experiences

towards neural correlate and back to experience

several decades of thriving research have uncovered much of what lies
behind our conscious experiences such as the complex and intricate
brain processes required to piece together what we sense coherently


even decoding a sound s origin in threedimensional space requires
complex computation within a specialised neural architecture

 yet we
are not directly aware of any of these myriad operations that are going
on behind the scenes and effortlessly turn toward the direction of a
loud sound

 these fascinating insights can describe the brain activity
associated with specific conscious perception forms in great detail

 we
already have a rich catalogue of such neural correlates and new
findings are frequently added



the problem is that while neural correlates highlight the brain s
necessary work in the background that makes specific conscious
experiences possible they fail to explain such experiences themselves


the processes are unconscious and even the results can often be
unconscious like when we are distracted or when a stronger stimulus
overrides another

 in those cases the exact same processes do not
result in a conscious experience



a rollercoaster can provide a thrilling ride but if it runs empty with
no one riding it no thrill is experienced

 this does not mean that
there is a little person inside watching the “theatre of the mind”—what
the british philosopher gilbert ryle 19492002 mockingly called “the
dogma of the ghost in the machine

” a majority of scientists and
philosophers reject this notion

 however it does mean that even though
neural correlates of consciousness are incredibly useful they don t
fully explain what consciousness is

5 things about the brain you probably didn t know

anil seth one of the leading researchers in this field suggests that
the ultimate or what he calls the “real question of consciousness” is
answering why a particular brain activity results in a specific
conscious experience and not merely establishing that it does seth
2021



experiences need explaining beyond their mechanistic underpinnings

 some
philosophers have gone as far as to suggest that what is experienced is
an illusion frankish 2016

 yet even in this extreme scenario if the
content of an experience is truly illusionary which few accept the
experience itself would still be real

 any philosophical psychological
or neurobiological theory of consciousness is incomplete without a full
account of experiences which brings us back to the act of experiencing



what exactly is consciousness



so what exactly is consciousness

 it is what we are most familiar with
and what undergirds every perception emotion and thought we have

 at
the same time it is an elusive notion that is difficult to define

 i
would suggest that it is linked to experiences it is the subjective and
active aspect the experiencing of an experience
