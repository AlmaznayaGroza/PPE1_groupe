spartan christianity

the evil conscience

 “let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith
 having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our
 bodies washed with pure water

”

 hebrews 1022

how could this be

 a conscience that is evil

 the traditionalists are
going to faint when they hear about this

 could it be that there is such
a thing as a conscience that directs man to do what is evil instead of
what is good

 absolutely

 just as it is possible to have a broken
compass that points east instead of north



the old testament talks about men whose hearts desired nothing but evil
continually genesis 65

 these men were later annihilated by the
flood

 think about sodom and gomorrah do you think those guys were
interested in doing what was right based on their conscience

 they were
only interested in sex with any man or woman they could find

 don t be
surprised this is what the heart mind and conscience of man can
degenerate into

 

the conscience of man can be such that instead of leading you to do what
is right it leads you to do what is evil

 again like the seared
conscience you can either develop an evil conscience or be born with
it

 the difference between the seared and evil conscience is that a
seared conscience is devoid of guilt or without regret from doing what
is wrong or the conscience itself is silent an evil conscience
however directs the heart of man towards evil instead of good doing
the opposite of what a normal functioning conscience would do

 

in theory a good conscience keeps us from doing wrong because it is a voice within that directs us towards the right action



an evil conscience desires for us to do what is wrong constantly and because of this desire there is no guilt associated with committing whatever evil deed your heart desires

 

you would be surprised to hear that such a conscience is actually quite
prevalent in the church

 because it is easy to do evil and still walk
into the assembly like there is nothing wrong

 this is popular at highly
liberal churches which i tend to call “adulterer s haven” churches
because many of them ignore the teachings of christ on divorce and
remarriage and allow anyone with an unscriptural marriage to enter their
assembly

 

an evil conscience will keep you sinning and give you no reason to
change

 all the popular  tools of change endorsed by the church
guiltshameconsciencefear have been taken out of your toolbelt


according to them you will not be able to progress

 without an
overwhelming sense of guilt how will you change

 

this statement gives you a bird s eye view into their ignorance of the
subject

 no emotion is necessary for change to occur even though
emotions can help on the path of change

 however guilt is uncommon for
men as it tends to be primarily a female emotion or one experienced by
weak betamales

 

men you must grow train progress and improve with or without emotional help



few modern men know this

 you aren t going to feel like going to work
every day no one does but you go anyway

 no one is going to feel like
working out every day but you do it anyways

 no man is going to feel
like listening to and loving their wife every day but they do it



men take action regardless of how they feel at the time

 regardless of
all emotion men must press on and do what is right

 they must work
improve train and move towards being the fully formed and functional
men they need to be

 reject the weak man s idea of conscience embrace
the rigid strength of discipline unaltered by feeling



mantra

reject conscience embrace action

 

evil conscience

application

if you have an evil conscience you must do the opposite of what your
conscience tells you to do

 it is as simple as that

 if your conscience
is evil it is pulling you towards evil action so you must resist your
conscience and oppose it in order to do what is right

 again it does
not matter if you feel like doing what is right or if you want to or
what your motivation is it only matters if you do what is right or not


what are your actions

 they can be good or evil regardless of what kind
of conscience you have

 

again and at risk of being overly redundant reject the idea of the
necessity of conscience

 

conscience is a tool to be used for change but change is possible
without this tool

 this is a principle fact of life

 you must do what is
right regardless of emotional states including the emotional state of a
conscience

 you must focus and take action

 do what is right

 be a man



conduct yourselves like men
