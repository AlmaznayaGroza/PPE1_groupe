guilty consciencebad conscience





guilt or guilty conscience is one of the most common negative or sad
emotions that people experience almost every day

 if not addressed
properly a guilty conscience can destroy your relationship steal your
joy your happiness and even your future

 yet the majority of us don t
know how to deal with it in a healthy way

 according to the german
philosopher friedrich nietzsche 1844 1900

 a guilty conscience can
push a person to become very cruel and do horrible things as a result


horrible things like killing committing suicide etc

 yet just like
any other emotions there s not a clear definition for a guilty
conscience

 so to better understand what it is one has to explore the
concept of right and wrong within society



in psychology for sigmund freud guilt resides under the surface veneer
of a person s behavior 1856 1939

 with that says guilt is a
selfconscious emotion that signals a person when hisher actions or
behaviors may have caused or will cause harm to others either
physically emotionally or both

 so to feel guilty is to feel painful
regret for something wrong one thinks heshe might have done



why feeling guilty is important



last week i wrote about psychological deflection and the major role our
ego plays in it

 in that article i said that our ego builds a
selfdefense system designed to protect us from feeling guilty or
remorseful for our bad behaviors or actions in order to keep our
selfesteem selfworth etc intact





i further said that over time
that same selfdefense system will start having negative effects on our
selfimage and the way we view the world

 this means no one can buy
himselfherself a getoutjailfree card in this universe

 to maintain
emotional and psychological balance it is necessary to experience guilt
for our bad behavior or actions

 besides a guilty conscience is like
having a snooze alarm in your head that won t shut off until it is
addressed and it has to be addressed in a healthy way



if not addressed properly a guilty conscience will make it very hard
for you to think straight and make the right decisions when necessary a
guilty conscience can also trigger shame anger emptiness and in many
cases sabotage your entire life and your relationship with others



a guilty conscience that is not addressed properly will also make you
become very paranoid and delusional

 for example a guilty conscience
may make you feel that everything people say or write in their social
media pages is about you and then consider it as a personal attack
against therefore you feel the urgency to respond to them defensively


such behavior will eventually throw you off balance emotionally and
psychologically and make you a good candidate for anxiety depression
or much worse

 a guilty conscience can also make you hate and punish
yourself avoid hearing nor seeing the person that you ve wronged it
will also push you to talk negatively about that person in order to
justify your bad behavior or actions and in many cases it can even
make you feel resentful towards himher because every time you hear or
see himher it reminds you what you have done



guilt can also make you hate that person you ve wronged and try to do
more harm to himher should you get the opportunity



how to effectively deal with a guilty conscience



1 the first step in dealing with a guilty conscience is always to
surrender to the truth repentance

 this means to stop fighting or
denying your guilt because the more you deny it the more intense the
pain will become

 never deny your guilt nor try to blame it on someone
else because as i ve said before no one can buy himselfherself a
getoutjailfree card in this universe

 this means denying your guilt
will have other effects

 2 the second step is to stop punishing
yourself

 understand that no one is perfect including you which leaves
the avenue of life wide open before you to make plenty of mistakes

 so
own your mistakes and learn from them

 if you re in an environment where
you feel like you re constantly being judged remove yourself from that
environment as soon as you can



3 the third step in dealing with a guilty conscience is to keep your
emotions and behavior in check at all time

 there s nothing more
embarrassing for a person than not being unable to control hisher
emotions or behavior

 such a person can easily snap at others for no
justifiable reason s and it does not look good at all

 4 the fourth
step is forgiveness and this is very very important

 through my
personal and professional experience i come to the conclusion that the
hardest part of forgiveness is not forgiving someone who ve wronged you
it is forgiving ourselves in other words selfforgiveness

 but here s
the thing to take that pressure off your back to enjoy life once
again to build high selfesteem and confidence in oneself
selfforgiveness is vital

 so seek forgiveness from the person you ve
wronged forgive yourself and then let it go



5 the fifth step is to focus on the now rather than the past

 i
often hear people said to others that they can t live in the past or
repeat the past

 whenever i hear that i smile because it s easier said
than done

 in fact the majority of us are actually living in the past
emotionally and psychologically

 and the sad thing is they re not even
aware of it

 if you don t own your past in other words take
responsibility and be mindful about it i can tell you right now that
your life is on a repeat mode and there s not much difference between
your past and your current situation

 this means your past keeps
repeating itself in your present and if you don t change your way of
doing things it will repeat itself in your future also

 6 the sixth and
final step is to always seek professional help psychologist if feel
like you re overwhelmed by a guilty conscience because it can lead to
more severe emotional or psychological situations even suicide
