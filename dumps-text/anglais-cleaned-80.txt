what are the four main theories of consciousness

what are the four main theories of consciousness





shutterstock agsandrew

in the early days of modern consciousness science back in the 1990s
researchers focused on identifying empirical correlations between
aspects of conscious experience and properties of brain activity

 this
search for the “neural correlates of consciousness” was motivated in
part as a response to concerns pervasive through much of the 20th
century that consciousness lay beyond the remit of science altogether


but despite its many successes this approach is limited because
correlations aren t explanations no matter how many you identify



in recent years however there has been a blossoming of neurobiological
theories of consciousness

 this is a sign of the field s growing
maturity because it is only when couched in terms of a theory that
experimental findings can deliver a satisfactory understanding of
consciousness



there are currently four main theoretical approaches in consciousness
science

 according to higherorder theories a mental state is conscious
when another mental state – higher up in a hierarchy – says that it is


for these theories the devil is in the detail about what kinds of
“higherorder” representations count for consciousness



global workspace theories propose that mental states are conscious when
they are broadcast widely throughout the brain so that they can be used
to flexibly guide behaviour

 a good way to think about global workspace
theory is that consciousness depends on “fame in the brain” – conscious
mental states have access to a wide range of cognitive processes in ways
that unconscious mental states don t

these two theories focus on functional aspects of consciousness and
emphasise frontal at the front and parietal towards the back and off
to the sides brain regions

 by contrast integrated information theory
focuses on phenomenological aspects of consciousness – what it is like
experientially – and proposes that consciousness is associated with a
posterior cortical “hot zone” located towards the back of the brain and
including parts of the parietal temporal and occipital lobes

 according
to this theory consciousness depends on the ability of a system to
generate integrated information



the fourth approach known as predictive processing is more indirect
being used primarily to build explanatory bridges between aspects of
consciousness and their underlying neural mechanisms

 there are several
examples of this approach ranging from those which associate
consciousness with topdown signalling in the brain to my own “beast
machine” theory

 for these theories the idea is that by progressively
accounting for diverse aspects of consciousness they can ultimately
shift from being theories for consciousness science towards being
theories of consciousness itself
