Class
consciousness
and
false
consciousness
are
concepts
introduced
by
Karl
Marx
that
were
later
expanded
by
social
theorists
who
came
after
him
.


Marx
wrote
about
the
theory
in
his
book
"Capital
,
Volume
1
,"
and
again
with
his
frequent
collaborator
,
Friedrich
Engels
,
in
the
impassioned
treatise
,
"Manifesto
of
the
Communist
Party
.

"
Class
consciousness
refers
to
the
awareness
by
a
social
or
economic
class
of
their
position
and
interests
within
the
structure
of
the
economic
order
and
social
system
in
which
they
live
.


In
contrast
,
false
consciousness
is
a
perception
of
one
'
s
relationships
to
social
and
economic
systems
of
an
individual
nature
,
and
a
failure
to
see
oneself
as
a
part
of
a
class
with
particular
class
interests
relative
to
the
economic
order
and
social
system
.




Marx
'
s
Theory
of
Class
Consciousness


According
to
Marxist
theory
,
class
consciousness
is
an
awareness
of
one
'
s
social
and/or
economic
class
relative
to
others
,
as
well
as
an
understanding
of
the
economic
rank
of
the
class
to
which
you
belong
in
the
context
of
the
larger
society
.


In
addition
,
class
consciousness
involves
an
understanding
of
the
defining
social
and
economic
characteristics
and
collective
interests
of
your
own
class
within
the
constructs
of
the
given
socio-economic
and
political
order
.



Class
consciousness
is
a
core
facet
of
Marx
'
s
theory
of
class
conflict
,
which
focuses
on
the
social
,
economic
,
and
political
relationships
between
workers
and
owners
within
a
capitalist
economy
.


The
precept
was
developed
in
conjunction
with
his
theory
on
how
workers
might
overthrow
the
system
of
capitalism
and
then
go
on
to
create
a
new
economic
,
social
,
and
political
system
based
on
equality
rather
than
inequality
and
exploitation
.




The
Proletariat
vs
.


the
Bourgeoisie


Marx
believed
that
the
capitalist
system
was
rooted
in
class
conflict—specifically
,
the
economic
exploitation
of
the
proletariat

(workers
)
by
the
bourgeoisie
(those
who
owned
and
controlled
production
)
.


He
reasoned
that
the
system
only
functioned
as
long
as
the
workers
did
not
recognize
their
unity
as
a
class
of
laborers
,
their
shared
economic
and
political
interests
,
and
the
power
inherent
in
their
numbers
.


Marx
argued
that
when
workers
came
to
understand
the
totality
of
these
factors
,
they
would
achieve
class
consciousness
,
and
this
,
in
turn
,
would
lead
to
a
workers
'

revolution
that
would
overthrow
the
exploitative
system
of
capitalism
.



Hungarian
social
theorist
Georg
Lukács
,
who
followed
in
the
tradition
of
Marxist
theory
,
expanded
the
concept
by
saying
that
class
consciousness
is
an
achievement
that
opposes
individual
consciousness
and
results
from
the
group
struggle
to
see
the
"totality"
of
social
and
economic
systems
.




The
Problem
of
False
Consciousness


According
to
Marx
,
before
workers
developed
a
class
consciousness
they
were
actually
living
with
a
false
consciousness
.


(Though
Marx
never
used
the
actual
term
,
he
did
develop
the
ideas
that
it
encompasses
.


)
In
essence
,
false
consciousness
is
the
opposite
of
class
consciousness
.


Individualistic
rather
than
collective
in
nature
,
it
produces
a
view
of
oneself
as
a
single
entity
engaged
in
competition
with
others
of
one
'
s
social
and
economic
standing
,
rather
than
as
part
of
a
group
with
unified
experiences
,
struggles
,
and
interests
.


According
to
Marx
and
other
social
theorists
who
followed
,
false
consciousness
was
dangerous
because
it
encouraged
people
to
think
and
act
in
ways
that
were
counterintuitive
to
their
economic
,
social
,
and
political
self-interests
.



Marx
saw
false
consciousness
as
a
product
of
an
unequal
social
system
controlled
by
a
powerful
minority
of
elites
.


The
false
consciousness
among
workers
,
which
prevented
them
from
seeing
their
collective
interests
and
power
,
was
created
by
the
material
relations
and
conditions
of
the
capitalist
system
,
by
the
ideology
(the
dominant
worldview
and
values
)
of
those
who
control
the
system
,
and
by
social
institutions
and
how
they
function
in
society
.



Marx
cited
the
phenomenon
of
commodity
fetishism—the
way
capitalist
production
frames
relationships
between
people
(workers
and
owners
)
as
relationships
between
things
(money
and
products
)—with
playing
a
key
role
in
producing
false
consciousness
among
workers
.


He
believed
that
commodity
fetishism
served
to
obscure
the
fact
that
relations
with
regard
to
production
within
a
capitalist
system
are
actually
relationships
between
people
,
and
that
as
such
,
they
are
changeable
.



Building
on
Marx
'
s
theory
,
Italian
scholar
,
writer
,
and
activist
Antonio
Gramsci
expanded
the
ideological
component
of
false
consciousness
by
arguing
that
a
process
of
cultural
hegemony
guided
by
those
holding
economic
,
social
,
and
cultural
power
in
society
produced
a
"common
sense"
way
of
thinking
that
embued
the
status
quo
with
legitimacy
.


Gramsci
noted
that
by
believing
in
the
common
sense
of
one
'
s
age
,
a
person
actually
consents
to
the
conditions
of
exploitation
and
domination
that
one
experiences
.


This
"common
sense"—the
ideology
that
produces
false
consciousness—is
actually
a
misrepresentation
and
misunderstanding
of
the
social
relationships
that
define
the
economic
,
social
,
and
political
systems
.




False
Consciousness
in
a
Stratified
Society


An
example
of
how
cultural
hegemony
works
to
produce
false
consciousness—that
is
true
both
historically
and
today—is
the
belief
that
upward
mobility
is
possible
for
all
people
,
regardless
of
the
circumstances
of
their
birth
,
as
long
as
they
choose
to
dedicate
themselves
to
education
,
training
,
and
hard
work
.


In
the
U
.

S
.


this
belief
is
encapsulated
in
the
ideal
of
"the
American
Dream
.

"
Viewing
society
and
one
'
s
place
within
it
based
on
the
set
of
assumptions
derived
from
"common
sense"
thinking
results
in
a
perception
of
being
an
individual
rather
than
part
of
a
collective
.


Economic
success
and
failure
rest
squarely
on
the
shoulders
of
the
individual
and
do
not
take
into
account
the
totality
of
the
social
,
economic
,
and
political
systems
that
shape
our
lives
.



At
the
time
Marx
was
writing
about
class
consciousness
,
he
perceived
class
as
the
relationship
of
people
to
the
means
of
production—the
owners
versus
the
workers
.


While
the
model
is
still
useful
,
we
can
also
think
about
the
economic
stratification
of
our
society
into
different
classes
based
on
income
,
occupation
,
and
social
status
.


Decades
'

worth
of
demographic
data
reveals
that
the
American
Dream
and
its
promise
of
upward
mobility
is
largely
a
myth
.


In
truth
,
the
economic
class
a
person
is
born
into
is
the
primary
determinant
of
how
he
or
she
will
fair
economically
as
an
adult
.


However
,
as
long
as
a
person
believes
the
myth
,
he
or
she
will
continue
to
live
and
operate
with
a
false
consciousness
.


Without
a
class
consciousness
,
they
will
fail
to
recognize
that
the
stratified
economic
system
in
which
they
'
re
operating
was
designed
to
afford
only
the
bare
minimum
of
money
to
workers
while
funneling
huge
profits
to
the
owners
,
executives
,
and
financiers
at
the
top
.
