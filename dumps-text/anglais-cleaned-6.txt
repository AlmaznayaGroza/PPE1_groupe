being a leader of conscience

leadership

sep 15

written by jon mertz

what does a leader of conscience mean

 it begins with character to avoid distorted values with a centered focus on virtues of humanity

 a leader of conscience engages in community conversations and identifies what virtues to act upon in the choices being made



sparked by professor richard shell s new book the conscience code i
explored what being conscience means

 it led me to the ethics centre a
nonprofit in sydney australia

 the ethics centre defines conscience
as

1

 what a person believes is right and

2

 how a person decides what is right

while conscience sounds simple it quickly gets complicated as we
encounter situations in which variables challenge us in what we believe
and what we decide is right

 in some cases our conscientious voice gets
it right immediately

 other times confusion reigns



our conscience and character are intimately linked



our character builds specific values and those values become engraved
in our souls

 while values are essential they have become distorted
resulting in dogmatic views without any clear perspective of what is
right



professor shell highlights three elements of character

 they are

1

 must have moral impulses – prompts us to behave well and resist
 temptations and pressures

2

 must have the awareness to know what values are relevant in the
 situation you face

3

 must bring selfdiscipline to own a situation and act on your values
 – even when costly or inconvenient

these character elements resonate

 however they still rest on values
which may be a problem today



rather than focus on values we need to raise our character to embrace
virtues



in pulling the thread on virtues another center came to the forefront


the markkula center for applied ethics at santa clara university
discusses virtues as a focus on the full development of humanity


virtues are attitudes dispositions or character traits that enable us
to be and to act in ways that develop this potential humanity

 the
development of humanity is crucial when considering our conscience and
how we decide what to do in challenging situations



another significant point on virtues is that they are developed through
learning and practice

 a community component is embedded

 for me this
means that we should and must have conversations about what virtues
are essential in our civic and business discourse

 it is a higherlevel
conversation which leads to a focus beyond our selfinterests



connecting conscience to character and virtues is imperative



too often lately values are being distorted to protect a power base
rather than engaging the value in how it helps humanity

 making a switch
to virtues can raise the leadership standard

 a new conscience
accountability checklist

 after our conscience determines an approach ask what virtue
 supports the decision



 with the selected decision ask what the impact on humanity will be



 if you have not explored the impacted virtue with others then put
 the decision aside until you do



we all need to engage in conversations about virtues and begin to raise
the standard of being a leader of conscience
