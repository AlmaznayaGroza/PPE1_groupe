Being
a
leader
of
conscience

Leadership

Sep

Written
By
Jon
Mertz

What
does
a
leader
of
conscience
mean
?


It
begins
with
character
to
avoid
distorted
values
with
a
centered
focus
on
virtues
of
humanity
.


A
leader
of
conscience
engages
in
community
conversations
and
identifies
what
virtues
to
act
upon
in
the
choices
being
made
.



Sparked
by
Professor
Richard
Shell
'
s
new
book
,
The
Conscience
Code
,
I
explored
what
being
conscience
means
.


It
led
me
to
the
Ethics
Centre
,
a
non-profit
in
Sydney
,
Australia
.


The
Ethics
Centre
defines
conscience
as
:

1
.


What
a
person
believes
is
right
,
and

2
.


How
a
person
decides
what
is
right

While
conscience
sounds
simple
,
it
quickly
gets
complicated
as
we
encounter
situations
in
which
variables
challenge
us
in
what
we
believe
and
what
we
decide
is
right
.


In
some
cases
,
our
conscientious
voice
gets
it
right
immediately
.


Other
times
,
confusion
reigns
.



Our
conscience
and
character
are
intimately
linked
.



Our
character
builds
specific
values
,
and
those
values
become
engraved
in
our
souls
.


While
values
are
essential
,
they
have
become
distorted
,
resulting
in
dogmatic
views
without
any
clear
perspective
of
what
is
right
.



Professor
Shell
highlights
three
elements
of
character
.


They
are
:

1
.


Must
have
moral
impulses
–
prompts
us
to
behave
well
and
resist

temptations
and
pressures

2
.


Must
have
the
awareness
to
know
what
values
are
relevant
in
the

situation
you
face

3
.


Must
bring
self-discipline
to
own
a
situation
and
act
on
your
values

–
even
when
costly
or
inconvenient

These
character
elements
resonate
.


However
,
they
still
rest
on
values
,
which
may
be
a
problem
today
.



Rather
than
focus
on
values
,
we
need
to
raise
our
character
to
embrace
virtues
.



In
pulling
the
thread
on
virtues
,
another
center
came
to
the
forefront
.


The
Markkula
Center
for
Applied
Ethics
at
Santa
Clara
University
discusses
virtues
as
a
focus
on
the
full
development
of
humanity
.


Virtues
are
"attitudes
,
dispositions
,
or
character
traits
that
enable
us
to
be
and
to
act
in
ways
that
develop
this
potential
[humanity
]
.

"
The
development
of
humanity
is
crucial
when
considering
our
conscience
and
how
we
decide
what
to
do
in
challenging
situations
.



Another
significant
point
on
virtues
is
that
they
are
developed
through
learning
and
practice
.


A
community
component
is
embedded
.


For
me
,
this
means
that
we
should
(and
must
)
have
conversations
about
what
virtues
are
essential
in
our
civic
and
business
discourse
.


It
is
a
higher-level
conversation
,
which
leads
to
a
focus
beyond
our
self-interests
.



Connecting
conscience
to
character
and
virtues
is
imperative
.



Too
often
lately
,
values
are
being
distorted
to
protect
a
power
base
rather
than
engaging
the
value
in
how
it
helps
humanity
.


Making
a
switch
to
virtues
can
raise
the
leadership
standard
.


A
new
conscience
accountability
checklist
:

-
After
our
conscience
determines
an
approach
,
ask
what
virtue

supports
the
decision
.



-
With
the
selected
decision
,
ask
what
the
impact
on
humanity
will
be
.



-
If
you
have
not
explored
the
impacted
virtue
with
others
,
then
put

the
decision
aside
until
you
do
.



We
all
need
to
engage
in
conversations
about
virtues
and
begin
to
raise
the
standard
of
being
a
leader
of
conscience
.
