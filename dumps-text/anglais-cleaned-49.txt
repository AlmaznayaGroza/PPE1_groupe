how does the human brain create consciousness and why





written by james kingsland on january 21 2023 — fact checked by harriet

scientists and philosophers have long struggled to explain how the brain
generates conscious experiences

 some doubt whether the objective tools
of science can ever get to grips with a phenomenon that is so
subjective

 even so researchers have begun to identify the changes in
brain activity that accompany awareness and they also have some
fascinating ideas about why consciousness evolved

how much do we really know about human consciousness

how the brain conjures conscious awareness from the electrical activity
of billions of individual nerve cells remains one of the great
unanswered questions of life



each of us knows that we are conscious in terms of having thoughts
perceptions and feelings but we are unable to prove it to anyone else


only we have access to the mysterious essence that allows us to
experience those thoughts perceptions and feelings



in the 1990s the philosopher david chalmers described this
inaccessibility to external objective scrutiny as the “hard problem” of
consciousness



he proposed that an easier task for scientists to tackle would be its
“neural correlates” — where and how brain activity changes when people
have conscious experiences



apart from curiosity scientists are most likely motivated to discover
the neural correlates of consciousness in order to help diagnose and
treat disorders of consciousness such as persistent vegetative states
and some psychiatric disorders



three dimensions of consciousness

consciousness has several distinct dimensions that they can measure


three of the most important ones are

 wakefulness or physiological arousal
 awareness or the ability to have conscious mental experiences
 including thoughts feelings and perceptions
 sensory organization or how different perceptions and more abstract
 concepts become woven together to create a seamless conscious
 experience



these three dimensions interact to produce our overall state of
consciousness from moment to moment

 for example when wide awake we
are in a state of high awareness but as we drift off to sleep at night
both wakefulness and awareness subside



awareness and physiological arousal return during rem rapid eye
movement sleep which is when vivid dreams are mostly likely to occur


but these sensory experiences are mostly disconnected from external
stimuli and detached from the concepts that anchor us to reality while
we are awake



in a similar way altered states of consciousness such as those induced
by psychedelic drugs or low oxygen levels involve normal levels of
arousal but disorganized sensory experiences



these can include hallucinations of sounds smells or sights but also
synesthesia when there is crosstalk between usually discrete senses
such as sounds that evoke visual experiences



people in a coma or under anesthesia can have levels of wakefulness
and awareness that are even lower than during nonrem sleep



meanwhile in a strange hybrid state of consciousness known as
unresponsive wakefulness syndrome or a vegetative state patients
undergo daily cycles of sleep and wakefulness but without showing any
sign of awareness



despite spending long periods with their eyes open they do not exhibit
behavioral responses to external stimuli



some of these patients will recover limited signs of awareness known as
a “minimally conscious state” such as the ability to respond to
instructions or follow a moving object with their eyes



the neural correlates of consciousness

patients in different states of consciousness have provided vital clues
about the neural correlates of consciousness



techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri and
electroencephalography eeg have revealed the neural activity that
accompanies these states



scientists detect patterns of activity through measures of functional
connectivity using statistical techniques to reveal correlations
between the timing of neural events in different parts of the brain



this reveals the networks of brain regions that are involved in working
memory attention and mindwandering for example



when they combine data from fmri and eeg researchers discover that
activity deep inside the brain in the thalamus varies during
wakefulness in step with activity in the default mode network



the thalamus operates like a sensory relay station while the default
mode network is a collection of regions within the cortex — the
outermost layer of the brain — that are intimately involved in
mindwandering and selfawareness



by contrast during nonrem sleep and under anesthetic functional
connectivity breaks down between the thalamus and the default mode
network and cortical networks that are involved in attention



in disorders of consciousness researchers can see reduced functional
connectivity and physical damage that affects the connections between
the cortex and deep brain structures



this demonstrates how important these connections are for maintaining
wakefulness and information exchange across the brain



the terrain of brain activity

despite advances in our understanding of the neural correlates of
consciousness however doctors still have trouble diagnosing patients
who are unable to respond to questions or commands



they cannot tell whether such a patient is completely unconscious
conscious but disconnected from external stimuli or conscious and aware
of their environment but unable to respond



a completely new approach reported recently in nature communications
may provide a way to assess such a patient s wakefulness awareness and
sensory organization



rather than recording the activity in particular brain regions or
networks of regions the new technique measures gradients of activity
across the brain



this is analogous to recording the steepness of terrain on a map and
how that steepness might change over time rather than just the
locations of roads towns and villages



this innovative way of investigating brain activity which considers how
functional geometry shapes temporal dynamics takes into account the
fact that each region and network has multiple functions and
connections



“consciousness is complex and studying it is like solving a scrambled
rubik s cube” says first author dr

 zirui huang research assistant
professor at the university of michigan medical school department of
anesthesiology



“if you look at just a single surface you may be confused by the way it
is organized

 you need to work on the puzzle looking at all dimensions”
he adds



three gradients of consciousness

dr

 huang and his colleagues looked at how gradients of neural activity
— as measured by fmri — changed with the three main dimensions of
consciousness

 arousability or wakefulness
 awareness
 sensory integration



the researchers drew on existing fmri data recorded from the brains of
people who were awake under anesthetic in a socalled vegetative state
— known as “unresponsive wakefulness syndrome” — or who had a
psychiatric diagnosis such as schizophrenia



they discovered an activity gradient that corresponded to changes in
arousal levels that stretched from the visual and default mode areas to
networks involved in attention



another gradient changed in step with awareness and stretched from
regions involved in perception and action to regions responsible for the
integration of information and formation of abstract concepts



a third gradient linked to sensory organization spanned the visual
system and the somatomotor cortex which helps to control movement



“we demonstrated that disruptions of human consciousness — due to
pharmacological neuropathological or psychiatric causes — are
associated with a degradation of one or more of the major cortical
gradients depending on the state” notes dr

 huang



he told medical news today that some patients who are unable to respond
in any way may still be conscious

 “it is therefore important to develop
behaviorindependent and taskindependent approaches to assessment” he
said



“according to our work cortical gradient measurements have the
potential to reduce the uncertainty of clinical assessment of
consciousness in those patients” he added



transcranial magnetic stimulation

scientists like dr

 huang have discovered a lot about its neural
correlates but their findings do not shed much light on how the brain
generates consciousness — the “hard problem”



other scientists have argued that to learn more about the causes of
consciousness you have to manipulate brain activity and see what
happens



transcranial magnetic stimulation or tms is a noninvasive technique
that changes brain activity in a tightly controlled way



the technique involves passing a strong electrical pulse through a
conductive coil held close to the participant s head creating a brief
magnetic pulse that induces electrical activity in the part of the brain
closest to the coil



this boosts the electrical activity of millions of neurons within a
region just a few centimeters in diameter



in an awake participant a tms pulse triggers a complex chain of
activity across multiple cortical areas whereas in nonrem sleep the
same pulse has a much briefer more localized effect



during rem sleep however the pulse evokes a pattern of activity
similar to that seen in the brain of a person who is wide awake



intriguingly in patients who are awake but in a vegetative state tms
induces shortlived local effects that are similar to those seen during
the nonrem sleep of a healthy person



but in the brain of awake minimally conscious patients tms evokes a
similar response to that seen in healthy awake people



researchers have therefore concluded that the complexity and spatial
extent of communication between brain regions subsides as levels of
wakefulness and awareness fall



theories of consciousness

despite advances in our understanding of the neural correlates of
consciousness the question remains how does consciousness arise from
brain activity



scientists have proposed several theories

 two prominent ideas are
global neuronal workspace theory gnwt and integrated information
theory iit



global neuronal workspace

in brief gnwt proposes that there is a network of longrange
connections that span the brain called the global workspace



neural information becomes conscious when it gains access to this
workspace which allows it to be broadcast throughout the brain
including to specialized hubs for memory perception motor output and
attention



crucially it is a case of “winner takes all” for a particular
interpretation of sensory data when it gains access to the global
workspace



according to prof

 michael graziano professor of psychology and
neuroscience at the princeton neuroscience institute nj and dr


aaronschurger assistant professor in the crean college of health and
behavioral sciences at chapman university in irvine ca this explains
for example “bistable” optical illusions



two examples of these are the necker cube and facevase illusion in
which conscious awareness switches between two alternative
interpretations of the same sensory data



integrated information

the communication and integration of information between brain regions
is at the heart of many theories of consciousness



one of these iit uses a complex equation to calculate an entity s
degree of consciousness from how well it integrates information



according to the equation even inanimate objects such as rocks and
teapots have a glimmer of consciousness



this is in keeping with the philosophical theory of panpsychism which
proposes that consciousness is a fundamental property of all physical
systems



how it feels to control attention

prof

 graziano has a problem with all these theories of consciousness


he argues that they cannot even be termed theories because they do not
actually explain consciousness they only describe it



he likens this to the difference between newton s law of gravitation
which is an equation that calculates gravitational force and einstein s
theory of general relativity which explains what gravity actually is



prof

 graziano s own theory of consciousness the attention schema
theory or ast does not claim to have cracked the hard problem of
consciousness but instead seeks to explain why we believe we are
conscious



according to ast animal brains evolved a model — or schema — of their
current state of attention that they could use to predict and control
their ongoing focus of attention



in order to control our bodies the brain uses an internal model of our
limbs their location in space and how they work

 prof

 graziano
believes the control of attention is no different



what is more he argues that the attention schema leads people to
believe that they have an internal essence —consciousness — that allows
them to focus their attention



contentfree awareness

amazingly expert meditators may be able to achieve a state of pure
awareness free from any thoughts perceptions feelings or even a
sense of selfhood time or space



this special state of consciousness has provided more clues about the
neural correlates of consciousness



researchers at the university of freiburg in germany used eeg to study
the brain of a former buddhist monk who described this as a “clear
aware openness

”

they found that contentfree awareness was associated with a sharp fall
in alpha waves and an increase in theta waves



there was also a decoupling of the activity of the sensory cortex and
dorsal attention network but strong activity within the attention
network itself

 meanwhile there was a decline in the activity of the
default mode network



prof

 graziano said contentfree awareness in meditation may correspond
to the predictive model of attention described in his theory



he told mnt

 “i think the model of attention representing the property of
 attention itself is possible to construct in isolation unassociated
 with a thing to which you are attending

 it may indeed be the
 contentfree awareness that meditators talk about

 i do think that
 meditation is essentially practice in using your attention schema

”

even without thoughts sensations or feelings it seems the mysterious
essence of conscious awareness remains
