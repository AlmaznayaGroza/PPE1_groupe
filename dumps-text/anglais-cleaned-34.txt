The
Modern
Misunderstanding
of
Conscience

The
Catholic
Church
teaches
that
the
conscience
is
a
natural
facility
of
our
reason
that
directs
us
to
do
good
and
avoid
evil
;
that
makes
judgments
about
the
good
and
evil
of
particular
acts
;
and
that
bears
witness
after
the
fact
to
the
good
or
evil
that
we
have
done
,
such
as
what
we
call
“having
a
guilty
conscience
.

”¹

A
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
the
role
of
the
human
conscience
lies
at
the
root
of
many
of
the
problems
in
the
Catholic
Church
today
.


Very
few
Catholics
even
know
what
that
role
actually
is
.


When
pressed
,
many
will
say
something
along
the
lines
of
“If
my
conscience
tells
me
that
a
particular
action
is
all
right
,
I
can
do
it
.

”

This
is
just
another
way
of
saying
“If
it
feels
good
,
do
it
.

”
If
an
improperly-formed
conscience
leads
a
person
to
accept
something
as
right
and
good
based
simply
on
his
or
her
uninformed
opinions
and
feelings
,
that
person
will
fall
into
grave
errors
for
which
there
is
no
good
excuse
before
God
:


When
Gentiles
who
have
not
the
law
do
by
nature
what
the
law
requires
,

they
are
a
law
to
themselves
,
even
though
they
do
not
have
the
law
.



They
show
that
what
the
law
requires
is
written
on
their
hearts
,
while

their
conscience
also
bears
witness
and
their
conflicting
thoughts

accuse
or
perhaps
excuse
them
on
that
day
when
,
according
to
my

gospel
,
God
judges
the
secrets
of
men
by
Christ
Jesus
.


(Romans

2
:14-15)

Many
Catholics
erroneously
believe
that
the
conscience
is
a
teacher
,
not
a
pupil
;
that
it
is
the
source
of
morality
.


This
is
not
the
teaching
of
the
Catholic
Church
.


According
to
the
Church
,
the
conscience
is
a
witness
to
the
moral
law
authored
by
God
.


Each
Catholic
is
required
to
obey
that
moral
law
in
all
things
.


The
conscience
,
if
properly
formed
,
calls
him
to
obey
that
moral
law
and
helps
him
to
understand
how
to
apply
it
in
particular
cases
.



This
is
why
the
cultivation
of
the
cardinal
virtue
of
prudence
is
essential
.


As
the
Catechism
teaches
,
“Man
strives
to
interpret
the
data
of
experience
and
the
signs
of
the
times
assisted
by
the
virtue
of
prudence
,
by
the
advice
of
competent
people
,
and
by
the
help
of
the
Holy
Spirit
and
his
gifts”
(¶1788)
.

Result
:
A
Deformed
Belief
System

The
belief
that
the
conscience
is
a
moral
authority
in
its
own
right
has
resulted
in
Catholics
supporting
and
promoting
many
intrinsic
evils
,
including
contraception
,
sterilization
,
abortion
,
homosexual
activity
,
pornography
and
euthanasia
.



Many
organizations
vigorously
promote
this
false
understanding
of
the
human
conscience
in
order
to
gain
more
support
from
Catholic
laity
.


One
of
these
groups
is
“Catholics”
for
Choice
(CFC)
,
whose
mission
consists
of
attempting
to
convince
people
that
they
can
be
pro-abortion
and
still
be
“good
Catholics
.

”
In
its
quarterly
magazine
,
ironically
entitled
Conscience
,
CFC
attempts
to
legitimize
the
obvious
paradox
that
“Church
law
affirms
both
the
right
and
the
responsibility
of
a
Catholic
to
follow
his
or
her
conscience
,
even
when
it
conflicts
with
church
teaching”²
(emphasis
added)
.



CFC
also
alleges
:


The
Catholic
Church
officially
teaches
that
the
conscience
of
an

individual
is
supreme
.


If
you
carefully
examine
your
conscience
and

then
decide
that
an
abortion
is
the
most
moral
act
you
can
do
at
this

time
,
you
are
not
committing
a
sin
.


Therefore
,
you
are
not

excommunicated
.


Nor
need
you
tell
it
in
confession
,
since
,
in
your

case
,
abortion
is
not
a
sin
.

³

It
is
easy
to
demonstrate
that
CFC
does
not
really
believe
this
principle
itself
.


For
example
,
would
it
concede
that
it
was
legitimate
for
someone
to
“carefully
examine
their
conscience”
and
then
decide
that
torching
an
abortion
clinic
in
the
middle
of
the
night
was
“the
most
moral
act
they
could
do
at
this
time
?

”

Obviously
not
.



This
is
a
fundamental
error
,
and
are
many
examples
of
how
it
naturally
carries
over
into
other
moral
issues
.


Teresa
Kelly
,
a
member
of
Toronto’s
Catholic
school
board
,
recently
said
that
being
part
of
a
gay-straight
alliance
whose
purpose
is
to
disseminate
homophile
propaganda
in
the
schools
is
“the
embodiment
of
a
perfectly-formed
Catholic
conscience
.

”
She
dismissed
her
critics
,
who
quoted
actual
Church
teachings
on
homosexuality
,
as
“archaic
.

Personal
Judgement
vs
.


Objective
Standards

How
does
conscience
relate
to
morality
?



In
order
for
a
person’s
conscience
to
be
conditioned
to
accept
evil
,
it
must
first
decisively
turn
away
from
God’s
teachings
and
decide
that
it
can
determine
for
itself
what
is
right
and
wrong
,
ignoring
all
external
and
objective
standards
if
necessary
in
order
to
reach
the
desired
conclusion
.



This
means
that
dissenters
must
justify
their
claims
by
assuming
that
there
is
no
fixed
morality
that
is
binding
on
all
persons
.


The
only
source
of
morality
is
the
conscience
of
each
individual
.


One
phrase
that
is
coming
into
common
usage
among
the
self-appointed
elite
is
“This
is
my
truth
.

”

However
,
the
intrinsic
flaw
with
that
understanding
is
the
fact
that
every
human
being
is
naturally
attuned
to
their
own
subjective
view
of
the
world
.


This
subjective
view
exists
in
order
to
promote
the
highest
good
of
the
individual
.


However
,
if
that
view
is
not
held
to
an
objective
standard
,
it
is
easy
for
the
individual
to
consider
not
what
is
morally
good
(i
.

e
.


,
virtuous)
but
rather
what
is
personally
good
(i
.

e
.


,
convenient)
.



This
type
of
thinking
leads
many
to
justify
actions
that
no
moral
law
would
permit
.



[natural
law
gives
moral
principles

,
which
then

Catholics
and
Church
Teaching

It
is
one
thing
for
a
person
to
say
“I
disagree
with
the
Church’s
teaching
on
abortion
.

”
It
is
another
thing
entirely
to
say
“The
Church
teaches
that
abortion
is
permissible
,
so
long
as
my
conscience
allows
it
.

”
This
statement
is
false
,
and
can
only
be
uttered
by
one
who
is
grossly
ignorant
of
Church
teaching
or
who
deliberately
lies
about
such
teaching
.



Ignorance
is
certainly
no
excuse
for
committing
sin
because
every
Catholic
has
the
duty
to
know
what
is
evil
and
what
is
not
,
and
,
further
,
they
should
know
why
certain
activities
are
evil
.


Secular
courts
enforce
the
general
rule
that
“ignorance
of
the
law
is
no
excuse
,”
and
everyone
accepts
this
principle
;
why
should
it
be
any
different
for
the
eternal
law
?



A
person
is
culpable
for
the
evil
he
commits
when
he
“takes
little
trouble
to
find
out
what
is
true
and
good
,
or
when
conscience
is
by
degrees
almost
blinded
through
the
habit
of
committing
sin
.

The
Formation
of
the
Conscience

The
conscience
is
a
precious
gift
and
it
must
be
cared
for
by
forming
it
with
prayer
and
education
for
the
duration
of
our
lives
.



The
Catechism
states
,
“The
education
of
conscience
is
indispensable
for
human
beings
who
are
subjected
to
negative
influences
and
tempted
by
sin
to
prefer
their
own
judgment
and
to
reject
authoritative
teachings”
(¶1783)
.



A
dead
giveaway
that
a
person’s
conscience
is
improperly
formed
is
when
he
or
she
says
something
like
“I
respect
the
teachings
of
the
Church
,
but
I
follow
my
own
conscience
in
matters
of
sexual
morality
.

”
Nancy
Pelosi
gave
us
a
typical
example
of
this
deception
when
she
claimed
that
she
was
a
“practicing
and
respectful
Catholic”
but
,
regarding
the
Church’s
teachings
on
abortion
,
“My
faith
isn’t
about
what
their
position
is
.

”⁶

This
means
that
the
person’s
conscience
has
become
disconnected
from
the
truth
.


This
has
several
root
causes
(Catechism
,
¶1792)
:

-
“Ignorance
of
Christ
and
His
Gospel
,
-
Bad
example
given
by
others
,
-
Enslavement
to
one’s
passions
,
-
Assertion
of
a
mistaken
notion
of
autonomy
of
conscience
,
-
Rejection
of
the
Church’s
authority
and
her
teaching
,
-
Lack
of
conversion
and
of
charity
.

”

By
contrast
,
a
properly‑formed
Catholic
conscience
has
been
rigorously
educated
,
is
fully
aware
of
the
intrinsically
evil
nature
of
abortion
and
other
evils
,
and
is
led
by
this
knowledge
to
vigorously
oppose
them
.



Failure
to
act
is
not
a
viable
option
.



It
is
true
that
Catholics
must
follow
their
consciences
,
but
their
consciences
must
be
formed
by
the
Word
of
God
,
which
is
authentically
interpreted
and
taught
by
the
Magisterium
of
the
Catholic
Church
,
to
which
Christ
entrusted
His
authority
to
teach
in
His
Name
.


The
conscience
must
be
continuously
schooled
to
recognize
,
not
to
determine
,
what
is
and
is
not
moral
activity
.



As
the
Catechism
teaches
,
“Objective
rules
of
morality
express
the
rational
order
of
good
and
evil
,
attested
to
by
conscience
.

…
It
is
by
the
judgment
of
conscience
that
man
perceives
and
recognizes
the
prescriptions
of
the
divine
law”
(¶1751
,
1778)
.

Conscience
and
Vatican
II

Some
appeal
to
an
ill‑defined
“Spirit
of
Vatican
II”
to
support
their
concept
of
the
human
conscience
.


They
use
vague
terms
such
as
“renewal
,”
“reinvigoration”
and
“rejuvenation”
of
the
Church
,
while
consciously
misrepresenting
what
the
documents
of
the
Council
actually
say
.


They
often
quote
the
Vatican
II
document
Dignitatis
Humanae
(“Declaration
on
Religious
Freedom”)
in
support
of
their
contention
that
people
should
be
able
to
do
anything
their
uneducated
consciences
do
not
object
to
.

⁷

However
,
this
is
obviously
not
what
the
Fathers
of
Vatican
II
taught
.


They
instead
laid
out
very
clearly
the
multiple
dangers
inherent
in
this
line
of
thinking
.


In
Gaudium
et
Spes
,
they
wrote
,
“Conscience
frequently
errs
from
invincible
ignorance
without
losing
its
dignity
.


The
same
cannot
be
said
for
a
man
who
cares
but
little
for
truth
and
goodness
,
or
for
a
conscience
which
by
degrees
grows
practically
sightless
as
a
result
of
habitual
sin”
(¶16‑17)
.


Furthermore
,
the
document
notes
that
“not
a
few
can
be
found
who
seem
inclined
to
use
the
name
of
freedom
as
the
pretext
for
refusing
to
submit
to
authority
and
for
making
light
of
the
duty
of
obedience
.

”⁸

The
document
continues
by
confirming
an
essential
principle
:
That
the
conscience
must
submit
itself
to
the
authority
of
the
Church
:


In
forming
their
consciences
,
the
Christian
faithful
must
give
careful

attention
to
the
sacred
and
certain
teaching
of
the
Church
.


For
the

Catholic
Church
is
by
the
will
of
Christ
the
teacher
of
truth
.


Her

charge
is
to
announce
and
teach
authentically
that
truth
which
is

Christ
,
and
at
the
same
time
with
her
authority
to
declare
and
confirm

the
principles
of
the
moral
order
which
derive
from
human
nature

itself
.


(¶14)

Conscience
does
have
a
very
particular
and
necessary
role
given
by
God
.


As
defined
in
Romans
2
:12‑16
and
Jeremiah
31
:33
,
God
imprints
the
natural
law
on
the
heart
and
soul
of
man
,
and
this
leads
him
to
know
whether
or
not
an
act
is
moral
or
evil
.

⁹
This
means
that
the
“natural
law”
is
man’s
instinctual
knowledge
of
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
―
his
“conscience
.

”
However
,
the
conscience
must
work
with
the
teachings
of
the
Church
,
never
against
it
.



 

Conscientious
Objection

The
Church
,
as
demonstrated
in
a
particularly
vivid
manner
by
Her
martyrs
,
has
always
held
that
a
person’s
properly-formed
conscience
may
never
be
violated
.


Countless
men
,
women
and
even
children
have
courageously
stated
,
“You
may
kill
me
,
but
you
will
never
force
me
to
violate
my
conscience
.

”

This
principle
has
more
recently
been
recognized
by
secular
authorities
.


The
United
Nations
,
in
both
its
1948
Universal
Declaration
of
Human
Rights
and
its
1966
International
Covenant
on
Civil
and
Political
Rights
,
states
that
“everyone
has
the
right
to
freedom
of
thought
,
conscience
and
religion
.

”

When
society
fails
to
acknowledge
conscience
as
a
human
right
and
does
not
provide
protections
for
individuals
to
follow
their
own
consciences
,
grave
conflicts
inevitably
result
.


Either
people
will
heroically
obey
their
consciences
whatever
the
cost
,
or
they
will
lose
their
moral
integrity
with
all
the
devastating
effects
that
flow
from
this
on
society
at
large
.



There
are
thousands
of
incidents
on
record
where
conscientious
objectors
are
severely
punished
,
particularly
in
the
health
care
profession
.


Many
have
been
fined
,
dismissed
from
their
jobs
,
and
even
in
some
cases
jailed
for
refusing
to
participate
in
such
intrinsic
evils
such
as
dispensing
contraceptives
and
abortifacients
and
refusing
to
participate
in
such
fundamental
violations
of
human
dignity
as
abortion
,
euthanasia
,
and
so-called
“sex-changed”
surgeries
.



 

Conclusion

Tragically
,
many
Catholics
possess
a
fatally
flawed
concept
of
conscience
,
denying
the
need
for
formation
in
the
truth
,
and
treating
mere
desire
as
an
absolute
.


Conscience
is
indeed
a
decision-maker
,
but
it
must
be
freely
submitted
to
the
law
of
God
,
to
which
it
is
a
witness
,
not
an
arbiter
.



The
error
lies
not
in
affirming
the
freedom
of
conscience
to
decide
,
but
in
misinterpreting
the
nature
of
such
freedom
.


Freedom
of
conscience
must
be
at
the
service
of
moral
truth
but
can
never
be
its
determinant
.

As
one
example
,
Frances
Kissling
says
,
“In
its
approach
to
the
[abortion]
issue
,
the
organization
[“Catholics”
for
Choice]
relied
on
the
Declaration
on
Religious
Freedom
,
the
Second
Vatican
Council’s
endorsement
of
the
separation
of
church
and
state
,
pluralism
,
and
the
primacy
of
conscience”

Father
John
Courtney

J
.


,
principal
author
of
this
document
,
anticipated
this
kind
of
dishonesty
.


He
stated
in
a
footnote
to
the
Abbott‑Gallagher
edition
of
the
Council
texts
:


The
Declaration
does
not
base
the
right
to
the
free
exercise
of

religion
on
“freedom
of
conscience
.

”
Nowhere
does
this
phrase
occur
.



And
the
Declaration
nowhere
lends
its
authority
to
the
theory
for

which
the
phrase
frequently
stands
,
namely
,
that
I
have
the
right
to

do
what
my
conscience
tells
me
to
do
,
simply
because
my
conscience

tells
me
to
do
it
.


This
is
a
perilous
theory
.


Its
particular
peril
is

subjectivism
―
the
notion
that
,
in
the
end
,
it
is
my
conscience
,
and

not
the
objective
truth
,
which
determines
what
is
right
and
wrong
,

true
or
false
.

The
Bible
contains
many
references
to
the
human
conscience
.


It
describes
the
fate
of
someone
who
does
not
guard
or
“keep”
his
conscience
(Hebrews
9
:14
and
1
Peter
3
:16)
,
and
who
allows
his
conscience
to
become
“seared”
(1
Timothy
4
:2)
.


The
Bible
also
speaks
of
a
“weak
conscience”
(1
Corinthians
8
:7)
,
a
“wounded
conscience”
(1
Corinthians
8
:12)
,
a
“good”
and
“perfect”
conscience
(Hebrews
9
:9
and
13
:18
;
1
Peter
3
:21
;
and
1
Timothy
1
:5
,19)
;
a
“clear”
or
blameless
conscience
(Acts
24
:16
and
1
Timothy
3
:9)
,
and
a
conscience
that
is
“evil”
or
defiled
(Titus
1
:15)
.
