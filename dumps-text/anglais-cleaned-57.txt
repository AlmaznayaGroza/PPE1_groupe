consciousness shared by individuals within a society

social consciousness or social awareness is collective consciousness
shared by individuals within a society

1

social consciousness is linked to the collective selfawareness and
experience of collectively shared social identity

2 from this
viewpoint social consciousness denotes conscious awareness of being
part of an interrelated community of others

 the “we feeling” or the
“sense of us” may be experienced in members of various cultures and
social groups

 by the experience of collectively shared social identity
individuals may experience social unity

 social consciousness may also
stimulate working towards a common goal



according to karl marx human beings enter into certain productive or
economic relations and these relations lead to a form of social
consciousness

1 marx said

 in the social production of their life men enter into definite
 relations that are indispensable and independent of their will these
 relations of production correspond to a definite stage of development
 of their material forces of production

 the sum total of these
 relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society
 — the real foundation on which rises a legal and political
 superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social
 consciousness

 the mode of production of material life determines the
 social political and intellectual life process in general

 it is not
 the consciousness of men that determines their being but on the
 contrary their social being that determines their
 consciousness
