consciously acknowledging an error or weakness as well as a strength
is the starting point for learning and generating improvements through
concrete actions

what is conscious leadership



 

the key to this type of leadership is precisely the consciousness of the
act of leading

 it means that being aware is not just about realizing it
but also about being capable of reflecting on our actions roles and
the repercussions of the actions we execute



this type of leadership implies that those in charge of a company s
destiny are fully present in their roles committed and engaged

responsibility for mistakes and learning from them while also analyzing
successes to replicate them

guide teams and the company



 

difference from traditional leadership

conscious leadership and traditional leadership are not differentiated
by just a single word

 while traditional leadership focuses on achieving
economic results conscious leadership places emphasis on three aspects
of value generation within the company profitability social
development and environmental care



additionally traditional leadership revolves around a leader who
prioritizes these results over personal attributes when making
decisions whereas conscious leadership requires a leader who seeks
selfawareness

 this entails understanding one s strengths and
weaknesses as well as the importance of making decisions and acting
with social and ethical responsibility



this significant difference makes conscious leadership the result of a
reflective process in which the leader knows oneself to then know and
accept others

 the challenge lies in promoting and implementing within
work teams the aspects qualities and business skills that echo
conscious leadership

 consciousness applied to decisionmaking within an
organization is crucial for leading positive changes

 why

leaders can make a difference and lead their teams towards excellence
