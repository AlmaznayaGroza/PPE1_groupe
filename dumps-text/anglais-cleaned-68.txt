following the work of georg wilhelm friedrich hegel karl marx outlined
the workings of a political consciousness



the politics of consciousness

edit

consciousness typically refers to the idea of a being who is selfaware


it is a distinction often reserved for human beings

 this remains the
original and most common usage of the term

 1 for marx
consciousness describes a person s political sense of self

 that is
consciousness describes a person s awareness of politics

 for marx an
authentic consciousness was linked to understanding one s true position
in history

 while hegel placed god behind the workings of consciousness
in people marx saw the political economy as the engine of mind

2

in the 20th century many social movements and intellectuals have
developed this use of consciousness



false consciousness

edit

main article false consciousness

in marx s view consciousness was always political for it was always
the outcome of politiceconomic circumstances

 what one thinks of life
power and self for marx is always a product of ideological forces



for marx ideologies appear to explain and justify the current
distribution of wealth and power in a society

 in societies with unequal
allocations of wealth and power ideologies present these inequalities
as acceptable virtuous inevitable and so forth

 ideologies thus tend
to lead people to accept the status quo

 the subordinate people come to
believe in their subordination the peasants to accept the rule of the
aristocracy the factory workers to accept the rule of the owners
consumers the rule of corporations

 this belief in one s own
subordination which comes about through ideology is for marx false
consciousness



that is conditions of inequality create ideologies which confuse people
about their true aspirations loyalties and purposes

3 thus for
example the working class has often been for marx beguiled by
nationalism organized religion and other distractions

 these
ideological devices help to keep people from realizing that it is they
who produce wealth they who deserve the fruits of the land all who can
prosper instead of literally thinking for themselves they think the
thoughts given to them by the ruling class

4

consciousness and the politicaleconomy

edit

for marx consciousness is a reflection of the political economy

 a
person s thoughts tend to be shaped by his or her political and economic
circumstances

 he famously wrote it is not the consciousness of men
that determines their being but on the contrary their social being
that determines their consciousness



 perhaps marx s greatest contribution to modern thought





 is his
 comprehensive investigation into the role of ideology or how social
 being determines consciousness which results in certain for the most
 part unconscious belief and value systems depending on the particular
 economic infrastructure pertaining at the time

 from a marxian point
 of view all cultural artifactsreligious systems philosophical
 positions ethical valuesare naturally enough products of
 consciousness and as such are subject to these ideological
 pressures
