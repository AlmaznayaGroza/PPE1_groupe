a conscience is a cognitive process that elicits emotion and rational
associations based on an individual s moral philosophy or value system


conscience stands in contrast to elicited emotion or thought due to
associations based on immediate sensory perceptions and reflexive
responses as in sympathetic central nervous system responses

 in common
terms conscience is often described as leading to feelings of remorse
when a person commits an act that conflicts with their moral values

 the
extent to which conscience informs moral judgment before an action and
whether such moral judgments are or should be based on reason has
occasioned debate through much of modern history between theories of
basics in ethic of human life in juxtaposition to the theories of
romanticism and other reactionary movements after the end of the middle
ages



religious views of conscience usually see it as linked to a morality
inherent in all humans to a beneficent universe andor to divinity

 the
diverse ritualistic mythical doctrinal legal institutional and
material features of religion may not necessarily cohere with
experiential emotive spiritual or contemplative considerations about
the origin and operation of conscience

1 common secular or
scientific views regard the capacity for conscience as probably
genetically determined with its subject probably learned or imprinted
as part of a culture

2

commonly used metaphors for conscience include the voice within the
inner light3 or even socrates reliance on what the greeks
called his daimōnic sign an averting ἀποτρεπτικός apotreptikos
inner voice heard only when he was about to make a mistake

 conscience
as is detailed in sections below is a concept in national and
international law4 is increasingly conceived of as applying to the
world as a whole5 has motivated numerous notable acts for the
public good6 and been the subject of many prominent examples of
literature music and film

seated buddha gandhara 2nd century ce

 the buddha linked conscience
with compassion for those who must endure cravings and suffering in the
world until right conduct culminates in right mindfulness and right
contemplation



in the literary traditions of the upanishads brahma sutras and the
bhagavad gita conscience is the label given to attributes composing
knowledge about good and evil that a soul acquires from the completion
of acts and consequent accretion of karma over many lifetimes

9
according to adi shankara in his vivekachudamani morally right action
characterised as humbly and compassionately performing the primary duty
of good to others without expectation of material or spiritual reward
helps purify the heart and provide mental tranquility but it alone
does not give us direct perception of the reality

10 this
knowledge requires discrimination between the eternal and noneternal
and eventually a realization in contemplation that the true self merges
in a universe of pure consciousness

11

in the zoroastrian faith after death a soul must face judgment at the
bridge of the separator there evil people are tormented by prior
denial of their own higher nature or conscience and to all time will
they be guests for the house of the lie

12 the chinese concept of
ren indicates that conscience along with social etiquette and correct
relationships assist humans to follow the way tao a mode of life
reflecting the implicit human capacity for goodness and harmony

marcus aurelius bronze fragment louvre paris to move from one
unselfish action to another with god in mind

 only there delight and
stillness



conscience also features prominently in buddhism

14 in the pali
scriptures for example buddha links the positive aspect of conscience
to a pure heart and a calm welldirected mind

 it is regarded as a
spiritual power and one of the guardians of the world

 the buddha
also associated conscience with compassion for those who must endure
cravings and suffering in the world until right conduct culminates in
right mindfulness and right contemplation

15 santideva 685–763 ce
wrote in the bodhicaryavatara which he composed and delivered in the
great northern indian buddhist university of nalanda of the spiritual
importance of perfecting virtues such as generosity forbearance and
training the awareness to be like a block of wood when attracted by
vices such as pride or lust so one can continue advancing towards right
understanding in meditative absorption

16 conscience thus manifests
in buddhism as unselfish love for all living beings which gradually
intensifies and awakens to a purer awareness17 where the mind
withdraws from sensory interests and becomes aware of itself as a single
whole

18

the roman emperor marcus aurelius wrote in his meditations that
conscience was the human capacity to live by rational principles that
were congruent with the true tranquil and harmonious nature of our mind
and thereby that of the universe to move from one unselfish action to
another with god in mind

 only there delight and stillness 





 the only
rewards of our existence here are an unstained character and unselfish
acts

the islamic concept of taqwa is closely related to conscience

 in the
qur ān verses 2197 2237 taqwa refers to right conduct or piety
guarding of oneself or guarding against evil

20 qur ān verse
4717 says that god is the ultimate source of the believer s taqwā which
is not simply the product of individual will but requires inspiration
from god

21 in qur ān verses 917–8 god the almighty talks about
how he has perfected the soul the conscience and has taught it the
wrong fujūr and right taqwā

 hence the awareness of vice and virtue
is inherent in the soul allowing it to be tested fairly in the life of
this world and tried held accountable on the day of judgment for
responsibilities to god and all humans

22



qur ān sura 49

 surah alhujurat 4913 declares come to know each
other the noblest of you in the sight of god are the ones possessing
taqwá



qur ān verse 4913 states o humankind

 we have created you out of male
and female and constituted you into different groups and societies so
that you may come to know each otherthe noblest of you in the sight of
god are the ones possessing taqwā

 in islam according to eminent
theologians such as alghazali although events are ordained and
written by god in allawh almahfūz the preserved tablet humans
possess free will to choose between wrong and right and are thus
responsible for their actions the conscience being a dynamic personal
connection to god enhanced by knowledge and practise of the five pillars
of islam deeds of piety repentance selfdiscipline and prayer and
disintegrated and metaphorically covered in blackness through sinful
acts

23 marshall hodgson wrote the threevolume work the venture
of islam conscience and history in a world civilization

24



the awakening conscience holman hunt 1853

in the protestant christian tradition martin luther insisted in the
diet of worms that his conscience was captive to the word of god and it
was neither safe nor right to go against conscience

 to luther
conscience falls within the ethical rather than the religious
sphere

25 john calvin saw conscience as a battleground the
enemies who rise up in our conscience against his kingdom and hinder his
decrees prove that god s throne is not firmly established
therein

26 many christians regard following one s conscience as
important as or even more important than obeying human
authority

27 according to the bible written in romans 215
conscience is the one bearing witness accusing or excusing one another
so we would know when we break the law written in our hearts the guilt
we feel when we do something wrong tells us that we need to
repent

28 this can sometimes as with the conflict between william
tyndale and thomas more over the translation of the bible into english
lead to moral quandaries do i unreservedly obey my
churchpriestmilitarypolitical leader or do i follow my own inner
feeling of right and wrong as instructed by prayer and a personal
reading of scripture

29 some contemporary christian churches and
religious groups hold the moral teachings of the ten commandments or of
jesus as the highest authority in any situation regardless of the
extent to which it involves responsibilities in law

30 in the
gospel of john 753–811 king james version jesus challenges those
accusing a woman of adultery stating he that is without sin among
you let him first cast a stone at her

 and again he stooped down and
wrote on the ground

 and they which heard it being convicted by their
own conscience went out one by one however the word conscience is
not in the original new testament greek and is not in the vast majority
of bible versions

 see jesus and the woman taken in adultery

 in the
gospel of luke 10 25–37 jesus tells the story of how a despised and
heretical samaritan see parable of the good samaritan who out of
compassionpity the word conscience is not used helps an injured
stranger beside a road qualifies better for eternal life by loving his
neighbor than a priest who passes by on the other side

31



nikiforos lytras antigone in front of the dead polynices 1865 oil on
canvas national gallery of greecealexandros soutzos museum

this dilemma of obedience in conscience to divine or state law was
demonstrated dramatically in antigone s defiance of king creon s order
against burying her brother an alleged traitor appealing to the
unwritten law and to a longer allegiance to the dead than to the
living

32

catholic theology sees conscience as the last practical judgment of
reason which at the appropriate moment enjoins a person to do good and
to avoid evil

33 the second vatican council 1962–65 describes
deep within his conscience man discovers a law which he has not laid
upon himself but which he must obey

 its voice ever calling him to love
and to do what is good and to avoid evil tells him inwardly at the
right movement do this shun that

 for man has in his heart a law
inscribed by god

 his dignity lies in observing this law and by it he
will be judged

 his conscience is man s most secret core and his
sanctuary

 there he is alone with god whose voice echoes in his
depths

34 thus conscience is not like the will nor a habit like
prudence but the interior space in which we can listen to and hear the
truth the good the voice of god

 it is the inner place of our
relationship with him who speaks to our heart and helps us to discern
to understand the path we ought to take and once the decision is made
to move forward to remain faithful35 in terms of logic
conscience can be viewed as the practical conclusion of a moral
syllogism whose major premise is an objective norm and whose minor
premise is a particular case or situation to which the norm is applied


thus catholics are taught to carefully educate themselves as to
revealed norms and norms derived therefrom so as to form a correct
conscience

 catholics are also to examine their conscience daily and
with special care before confession

 catholic teaching holds that man
has the right to act according to his conscience and in freedom so as
personally to make moral decisions

 he must not be forced to act
contrary to his conscience

 nor must he be prevented from acting
according to his conscience especially in religious matters

36
this right of conscience does not allow one to arbitrarily disagree with
church teaching and claim that one is acting in accordance with
conscience

 a sincere conscience presumes one is diligently seeking
moral truth from authentic sources that is seeking to conform oneself
to that moral truth by listening to the authority established by christ
to teach it

 nevertheless despite one s best effort it can happen
that moral conscience remains in ignorance and makes erroneous judgments
about acts to be performed or already committed 





 this ignorance can
often be imputed to personal responsibility 





 in such cases the
person is culpable for the wrong he commits

37 thus if one
realizes one may have made a mistaken judgment one s conscience is said
to be vincibly erroneous and it is not a valid norm for action

 one must
first remove the source of error and do one s best to achieve a correct
judgment

 if however one is not aware of one s error or if despite an
honest and diligent effort one cannot remove the error by study or
seeking advice then one s conscience may be said to be invincibly
erroneous

 it binds since one has subjective certainty that one is
correct

 the act resulting from acting on the invincibly erroneous
conscience is not good in itself yet this deformed act or material sin
against god s right order and the objective norm is not imputed to the
person

 the formal obedience given to such a judgment of conscience is
good

 some catholics appeal to conscience in order to justify dissent
not on the level of conscience properly understood but on the level of
the principles and norms which are supposed to inform conscience

 for
example some priests make on the use of the socalled internal forum
solution which is not sanctioned by the magisterium to justify actions
or lifestyles incompatible with church teaching such as christ s
prohibition of remarriage after divorce or sexual activity outside
marriage

citation needed the catholic church has warned that
rejection of the church s authority and her teaching 





 can be at the
source of errors in judgment in moral conduct

38 an example of
someone following his conscience to the point of accepting the
consequence of being condemned to death is sir thomas more
14781535

39 a theologian who wrote on the distinction between
the sense of duty and the moral sense as two aspects of conscience
and who saw the former as some feeling that can only be explained by a
divine lawgiver was john henry cardinal newman

40 a well known
saying of him is that he would first toast on his conscience and only
then on the pope since his conscience brought him to acknowledge the
authority of the pope

41

judaism arguably does not require uncompromising obedience to religious
authority the case has been made that throughout jewish history rabbis
have circumvented laws they found unconscionable such as capital
punishment

42 similarly although an occupation with national
destiny has been central to the jewish faith see zionism many scholars
including moses mendelssohn stated that conscience as a personal
revelation of scriptural truth was an important adjunct to the talmudic
tradition

4344 the concept of inner light in the religious
society of friends or quakers is associated with conscience

3
freemasonry describes itself as providing an adjunct to religion and key
symbols found in a freemason lodge are the square and compasses
explained as providing lessons that masons should square their actions
by the square of conscience learn to circumscribe their desires and
keep their passions within due bounds toward all mankind

45 the
historian manning clark viewed conscience as one of the comforters that
religion placed between man and death but also a crucial part of the
quest for grace encouraged by the book of job and the book of
ecclesiastes leading us to be paradoxically closest to the truth when
we suspect that what matters most in life being there when everyone
suddenly understands what it has all been for can never happen

46
leo tolstoy after a decade studying the issue 1877–1887 held that
the only power capable of resisting the evil associated with materialism
and the drive for social power of religious institutions was the
capacity of humans to reach an individual spiritual truth through reason
and conscience

47 many prominent religious works about conscience
also have a significant philosophical component examples are the works
of alghazali48 avicenna49 aquinas50 joseph
butler51 and dietrich bonhoeffer52 all discussed in the
philosophical views section

illustration of françois chifflart 1825–1901 for la conscience by
victor hugo



charles darwin thought that any animal endowed with wellmarked social
instincts would inevitably acquire a moral sense or conscience as its
intellectual powers approximated man s



the secular approach to conscience includes psychological
physiological sociological humanitarian and authoritarian
views

53 lawrence kohlberg considered critical conscience to be an
important psychological stage in the proper moral development of humans
associated with the capacity to rationally weigh principles of
responsibility being best encouraged in the very young by linkage with
humorous personifications such as jiminy cricket and later in
adolescents by debates about individually pertinent moral
dilemmas

54 erik erikson placed the development of conscience in
the preschooler phase of his eight stages of normal human personality
development

55 the psychologist martha stout terms conscience an
intervening sense of obligation based in our emotional
attachments

56 thus a good conscience is associated with feelings
of integrity psychological wholeness and peacefulness and is often
described using adjectives such as quiet clear and easy

57

sigmund freud regarded conscience as originating psychologically from
the growth of civilisation which periodically frustrated the external
expression of aggression this destructive impulse being forced to seek
an alternative healthy outlet directed its energy as a superego
against the person s own ego or selfishness often taking its cue in
this regard from parents during childhood

58 according to freud
the consequence of not obeying our conscience is guilt which can be a
factor in the development of neurosis freud claimed that both the
cultural and individual superego set up strict ideal demands with
regard to the moral aspects of certain decisions disobedience to which
provokes a fear of conscience 

59

antonio damasio considers conscience an aspect of extended consciousness
beyond survivalrelated dispositions and incorporating the search for
truth and desire to build norms and ideals for behavior

 60

conscience as a societyforming instinct

edit



jeremy bentham fanaticism never sleeps 





 it is never stopped by
conscience for it has pressed conscience into its service



michel glautier argues that conscience is one of the instincts and
drives which enable people to form societies groups of humans without
these drives or in whom they are insufficient cannot form societies and
do not reproduce their kind as successfully as those that do

61



war criminal adolf eichmann in passport used to enter argentina his
conscience spoke with the respectable voice of the indoctrinated
wartime german society that surrounded him



charles darwin considered that conscience evolved in humans to resolve
conflicts between competing natural impulsessome about
selfpreservation but others about safety of a family or community the
claim of conscience to moral authority emerged from the greater
duration of impression of social instincts in the struggle for
survival

62 in such a view behavior destructive to a person s
society either to its structures or to the persons it comprises is bad
or evil

63 thus conscience can be viewed as an outcome of those
biological drives that prompt humans to avoid provoking fear or contempt
in others being experienced as guilt and shame in differing ways from
society to society and person to person

64 a requirement of
conscience in this view is the capacity to see ourselves from the point
of view of another person

65 persons unable to do this
psychopaths sociopaths narcissists therefore often act in ways which
are evil

66

fundamental in this view of conscience is that humans consider some
other as being in a social relationship

 thus nationalism is invoked
in conscience to quell tribal conflict and the notion of a brotherhood
of man is invoked to quell national conflicts

 yet such crowd drives may
not only overwhelm but redefine individual conscience

 friedrich
nietzsche stated communal solidarity is annihilated by the highest and
strongest drives that when they break out passionately whip the
individual far past the average low level of the
 herdconscience

 67 jeremy bentham noted that fanaticism never
sleeps 





 it is never stopped by conscience for it has pressed
conscience into its service

68 hannah arendt in her study of the
trial of adolf eichmann in jerusalem notes that the accused as with
almost all his fellow germans had lost track of his conscience to the
point where they hardly remembered it this wasn t caused by familiarity
with atrocities or by psychologically redirecting any resultant natural
pity to themselves for having to bear such an unpleasant duty so much
as by the fact that anyone whose conscience did develop doubts could see
no one who shared them eichmann did not need to close his ears to the
voice of conscience 





 not because he had none but because his
conscience spoke with a respectable voice with the voice of the
respectable society around him

69

sir arthur keith in 1948 developed the amityenmity complex

 we evolved
as tribal groups surrounded by enemies thus conscience evolved a dual
role the duty to save and protect members of the ingroup and the duty
to show hatred and aggression towards any outgroup



an interesting area of research in this context concerns the
similarities between our relationships and those of animals whether
animals in human society pets working animals even animals grown for
food or in the wild

70 one idea is that as people or animals
perceive a social relationship as important to preserve their
conscience begins to respect that former other and urge actions that
protect it

7172 similarly in complex territorial and cooperative
breeding bird communities such as the australian magpie that have a
high degree of etiquettes rules hierarchies play songs and
negotiations rulebreaking seems tolerated on occasions not obviously
related to survival of the individual or group behaviour often
appearing to exhibit a touching gentleness and tenderness

73

evolutionary biology

edit

contemporary scientists in evolutionary biology seek to explain
conscience as a function of the brain that evolved to facilitate
altruism within societies

74 in his book the god delusion richard
dawkins states that he agrees with robert hinde s why good is good
michael shermer s the science of good and evil robert buckman s can we
be good without god

 and marc hauser s moral minds that our sense of
right and wrong can be derived from our darwinian past

 he subsequently
reinforced this idea through the lens of the genecentered view of
evolution since the unit of natural selection is neither an individual
organism nor a group but rather the selfish gene and these genes
could ensure their own selfish survival by inter alia pushing
individuals to act altruistically towards its kin

75

neuroscience and artificial conscience

edit

numerous case studies of brain damage have shown that damage to areas of
the brain such as the anterior prefrontal cortex results in the
reduction or elimination of inhibitions with a corresponding radical
change in behaviour

76 when the damage occurs to adults they may
still be able to perform moral reasoning but when it occurs to
children they may never develop that ability

7778

attempts have been made by neuroscientists to locate the free will
necessary for what is termed the veto of conscience over unconscious
mental processes see neuroscience of free will and benjamin libet in a
scientifically measurable awareness of an intention to carry out an act
occurring 350–400 microseconds after the electrical discharge known as
the readiness potential

 798081

jacques pitrat claims that some kind of artificial conscience is
beneficial in artificial intelligence systems to improve their longterm
performance and direct their introspective processing

82

philosophical

edit

further information free will compatibilism and incompatibilism
determinism libertarianism metaphysics theory of justification
virtue ethics metaethics moral motivation and normative ethics

the word conscience derives etymologically from the latin conscientia
meaning privity of knowledge83 or withknowledge

 the english
word implies internal awareness of a moral standard in the mind
concerning the quality of one s motives as well as a consciousness of
our own actions

84 thus conscience considered philosophically may
be first and perhaps most commonly a largely unexamined gut feeling
or vague sense of guilt about what ought to be or should have been
done

85 conscience in this sense is not necessarily the product of
a process of rational consideration of the moral features of a situation
or the applicable normative principles rules or laws and can arise
from parental peer group religious state or corporate indoctrination
which may or may not be presently consciously acceptable to the person
traditional conscience

86 conscience may be defined as the
practical reason employed when applying moral convictions to a situation
critical conscience

87 in purportedly morally mature mystical
people who have developed this capacity through daily contemplation or
meditation combined with selfless service to others critical conscience
can be aided by a spark of intuitive insight or revelation called
marifa in islamic sufi philosophy and synderesis in medieval christian
scholastic moral philosophy

8889 conscience is accompanied in
each case by an internal awareness of inner light and approbation or
 inner darkness and condemnation as well as a resulting conviction of
right or duty either followed or declined

90

medieval

edit

the medieval islamic scholar and mystic alghazali divided the concept
of nafs soul or self spirituality into three categories48 based
on the qur an

1

 nafs ammarah 1253 which exhorts one to freely indulge in
 gratifying passions and instigates to do evil
2

 nafs lawammah 752 which is the conscience that directs man
 towards right or wrong
3

 nafs mutmainnah 8927 which is a self that reaches the ultimate
 peace

the medieval persian philosopher and physician muhammad ibn zakariya
alrazi believed in a close relationship between conscience or spiritual
integrity and physical health rather than being selfindulgent man
should pursue knowledge use his intellect and apply justice in his
life

91 the medieval islamic philosopher avicenna whilst
imprisoned in the castle of fardajan near hamadhan wrote his famous
isolatedbutawake floating man sensory deprivation thought experiment
to explore the ideas of human selfawareness and the substantiality of
the soul his hypothesis being that it is through intelligence
particularly the active intellect that god communicates truth to the
human mind or conscience

49 according to the islamic sufis
conscience allows allah to guide people to the marifa the peace or
light upon light experienced where a muslim s prayers lead to a
melting away of the self in the inner knowledge of god this
foreshadowing the eternal paradise depicted in the qur ān

92



the flemish mystic jan van ruysbroeck viewed a pure conscience as
facilitating an outflowing losing of oneself in the abyss of that
eternal object which is the highest and chief blessedness



some medieval christian scholastics such as bonaventure made a
distinction between conscience as a rational faculty of the mind
practical reason and inner awareness an intuitive spark to do good
called synderesis arising from a remnant appreciation of absolute good
and when consciously denied for example to perform an evil act
becoming a source of inner torment

89 early modern theologians such
as william perkins and william ames developed a syllogistic
understanding of the conscience where god s law made the first term
the act to be judged the second and the action of the conscience as a
rational faculty produced the judgement

 by debating test cases
applying such understanding conscience was trained and refined i

e


casuistry

93



the medieval persian philosopher ibn sina avicenna developed a sensory
deprivation thought experiment to explore the relationship between
conscience and god



in the 13th century st

 thomas aquinas regarded conscience as the
application of moral knowledge to a particular case s

t

 i q

 79 a


13

 thus conscience was considered an act or judgment of practical
reason that began with synderesis the structured development of our
innate remnant awareness of absolute good which he categorised as
involving the five primary precepts proposed in his theory of natural
law into an acquired habit of applying moral principles

50
according to singer aquinas held that conscience or conscientia was an
imperfect process of judgment applied to activity because knowledge of
the natural law and all acts of natural virtue implicit therein was
obscured in most people by education and custom that promoted
selfishness rather than fellowfeeling summa theologiae i–ii
i

94 aquinas also discussed conscience in relation to the virtue
of prudence to explain why some people appear to be less morally
enlightened than others their weak will being incapable of adequately
balancing their own needs with those of others

95

aquinas reasoned that acting contrary to conscience is an evil action
but an errant conscience is only blameworthy if it is the result of
culpable or vincible ignorance of factors that one has a duty to have
knowledge of

94 aquinas also argued that conscience should be
educated to act towards real goods from god which encouraged human
flourishing rather than the apparent goods of sensory pleasures

94
in his commentary on aristotle s nicomachean ethics aquinas claimed it
was weak will that allowed a nonvirtuous man to choose a principle
allowing pleasure ahead of one requiring moral constraint

96

thomas a kempis in the medieval contemplative classic the imitation of
christ ca 1418 stated that the glory of a good man is the witness of a
good conscience

 preserve a quiet conscience and you will always have
joy

 a quiet conscience can endure much and remains joyful in all
trouble but an evil conscience is always fearful and uneasy

97
the anonymous medieval author of the christian mystical work the cloud
of unknowing similarly expressed the view that in profound and prolonged
contemplation a soul dries up the root and ground of the sin that is
always there even after one s confession and however busy one is in
holy things therefore whoever would work at becoming a contemplative
must first cleanse his or her conscience

98 the medieval flemish
mystic john of ruysbroeck likewise held that true conscience has four
aspects that are necessary to render a man just in the active and
contemplative life a free spirit attracting itself through love an
intellect enlightened by grace a delight yielding propension or
inclination and an outflowing losing of oneself in the abyss of 






that eternal object which is the highest and chief blessedness 





 those

schopenhauer considered that the good conscience we experience after an
unselfish act verifies that our true self exists outside our physical
person





benedict de spinoza moral problems and our emotional responses to them
should be reasoned from the perspective of eternity





immanuel kant the moral law within us has true infinity



benedict de spinoza in his ethics published after his death in 1677
argued that most people even those that consider themselves to exercise
free will make moral decisions on the basis of imperfect sensory
information inadequate understanding of their mind and will as well as
emotions which are both outcomes of their contingent physical existence
and forms of thought defective from being chiefly impelled by
selfpreservation

100 the solution according to spinoza was to
gradually increase the capacity of our reason to change the forms of
thought produced by emotions and to fall in love with viewing problems
requiring moral decision from the perspective of eternity

101 thus
living a life of peaceful conscience means to spinoza that reason is
used to generate adequate ideas where the mind increasingly sees the
world and its conflicts our desires and passions sub specie
aeternitatis that is without reference to time

102 hegel s obscure
and mystical philosophy of mind held that the absolute right of freedom
of conscience facilitates human understanding of an allembracing unity
an absolute which was rational real and true

103 nevertheless
hegel thought that a functioning state would always be tempted not to
recognize conscience in its form of subjective knowledge just as
similar nonobjective opinions are generally rejected in
science

104 a similar idealist notion was expressed in the writings
of joseph butler who argued that conscience is godgiven should always
be obeyed is intuitive and should be considered the constitutional
monarch and the universal moral faculty conscience does not only
offer itself to show us the way we should walk in but it likewise
carries its own authority with it

105 butler advanced ethical
speculation by referring to a duality of regulative principles in human
nature first selflove seeking individual happiness and second
benevolence compassion and seeking good for another in conscience
also linked to the agape of situational ethics

51 conscience
tended to be more authoritative in questions of moral judgment thought
butler because it was more likely to be clear and certain whereas
calculations of selfinterest tended to probable and changing
conclusions

106 john selden in his table talk expressed the view
that an awake but excessively scrupulous or illtrained conscience could
hinder resolve and practical action it being like a horse that is not
well wayed he starts at every bird that flies out of the
hedge

107

as the sacred texts of ancient hindu and buddhist philosophy became
available in german translations in the 18th and 19th centuries they
influenced philosophers such as schopenhauer to hold that in a healthy
mind only deeds oppress our conscience not wishes and thoughts for it
is only our deeds that hold us up to the mirror of our will the good
conscience thought schopenhauer we experience after every
disinterested deed arises from direct recognition of our own inner being
in the phenomenon of another it affords us the verification that our
true self exists not only in our own person this particular
manifestation but in everything that lives

 by this the heart feels
itself enlarged as by egotism it is contracted

108

immanuel kant a central figure of the age of enlightenment likewise
claimed that two things filled his mind with ever new and increasing
admiration and awe the oftener and more steadily they were reflected
on the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me 





 the
latter begins from my invisible self my personality and exhibits me in
a world which has true infinity but which i recognise myself as existing
in a universal and necessary and not only as in the first case
contingent connection

109 the universal connection referred to
here is kant s categorical imperative act only according to that maxim
by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal
law

110 kant considered critical conscience to be an internal
court in which our thoughts accuse or excuse one another he
acknowledged that morally mature people do often describe contentment or
peace in the soul after following conscience to perform a duty but
argued that for such acts to produce virtue their primary motivation
should simply be duty not expectation of any such bliss

111
rousseau expressed a similar view that conscience somehow connected man
to a greater metaphysical unity

 john plamenatz in his critical
examination of rousseau s work considered that conscience was there
defined as the feeling that urges us in spite of contrary passions
towards two harmonies the one within our minds and between our
passions and the other within society and between its members the
weakest can appeal to it in the strongest and the appeal though often
unsuccessful is always disturbing

 however corrupted by power or
wealth we may be either as possessors of them or as victims there is
something in us serving to remind us that this corruption is against
nature

112



john locke viewed the widespread social fact of conscience as a
justification for natural rights





adam smith conscience shows what relates to ourselves in its proper
shape and dimensions



samuel johnson 1775 stated that no man s conscience can tell him the
right of another man



other philosophers expressed a more sceptical and pragmatic view of the
operation of conscience in society

113 john locke in his essays
on the law of nature argued that the widespread fact of human conscience
allowed a philosopher to infer the necessary existence of objective
moral laws that occasionally might contradict those of the
state

114 locke highlighted the metaethics problem of whether
accepting a statement like follow your conscience supports
subjectivist or objectivist conceptions of conscience as a guide in
concrete morality or as a spontaneous revelation of eternal and
immutable principles to the individual if conscience be a proof of
innate principles contraries may be innate principles since some men
with the same bent of conscience prosecute what others avoid

115
thomas hobbes likewise pragmatically noted that opinions formed on the
basis of conscience with full and honest conviction nevertheless should
always be accepted with humility as potentially erroneous and not
necessarily indicating absolute knowledge or truth

116 william
godwin expressed the view that conscience was a memorable consequence of
the perception by men of every creed when the descend into the scene of
busy life that they possess free will

117 adam smith considered
that it was only by developing a critical conscience that we can ever
see what relates to ourselves in its proper shape and dimensions or
that we can ever make any proper comparison between our own interests
and those of other people

118 john stuart mill believed that
idealism about the role of conscience in government should be tempered
with a practical realisation that few men in society are capable of
directing their minds or purposes towards distant or unobvious
interests of disinterested regard for others and especially for what
comes after them for the idea of posterity of their country or of
humanity whether grounded on sympathy or on a conscientious
feeling

119 mill held that certain amount of conscience and of
disinterested public spirit may fairly be calculated on in the citizens
of any community ripe for representative government but that it would
be ridiculous to expect such a degree of it combined with such
intellectual discernment as would be proof against any plausible
fallacy tending to make that which was for their class interest appear
the dictate of justice and of the general good

119

josiah royce 1855–1916 built on the transcendental idealism view of
conscience viewing it as the ideal of life which constitutes our moral
personality our plan of being ourself of making common sense ethical
decisions

 but he thought this was only true insofar as our conscience
also required loyalty to a mysterious higher or deeper self

120
in the modern christian tradition this approach achieved expression with
dietrich bonhoeffer who stated during his imprisonment by the nazis in
world war ii that conscience for him was more than practical reason
indeed it came from a depth which lies beyond a man s own will and his
own reason and it makes itself heard as the call of human existence to
unity with itself

121 for bonhoeffer a guilty conscience arose as
an indictment of the loss of this unity and as a warning against the
loss of one s self primarily he thought it is directed not towards a
particular kind of doing but towards a particular mode of being

 it
protests against a doing which imperils the unity of this being with
itself

52 conscience for bonhoeffer did not like shame embrace or
pass judgment on the morality of the whole of its owner s life it
reacted only to certain definite actions it recalls what is long past
and represents this disunion as something which is already accomplished
and irreparable

122 the man with a conscience he believed fights
a lonely battle against the overwhelming forces of inescapable
situations which demand moral decisions despite the likelihood of
adverse consequences

122 simon soloveychik has similarly claimed
that the truth distributed in the world as the statement about human
dignity as the affirmation of the line between good and evil lives in
people as conscience

123



dietrich bonhoeffer 1932

as hannah arendt pointed out however following the utilitarian john
stuart mill on this point a bad conscience does not necessarily
signify a bad character in fact only those who affirm a commitment to
applying moral standards will be troubled with remorse guilt or shame
by a bad conscience and their need to regain integrity and wholeness of
the self

124125 representing our soul or true self by analogy as
our house arendt wrote that conscience is the anticipation of the
fellow who awaits you if and when you come home

126 arendt
believed that people who are unfamiliar with the process of silent
critical reflection about what they say and do will not mind
contradicting themselves by an immoral act or crime since they can
count on its being forgotten the next moment bad people are not full
of regrets

126 arendt also wrote eloquently on the problem of
languages distinguishing the word consciousness from conscience

 one
reason she held was that conscience as we understand it in moral or
legal matters is supposedly always present within us just like
consciousness and this conscience is also supposed to tell us what to
do and what to repent before it became the lumen naturale or kant s
practical reason it was the voice of god

127



albert einstein associated conscience with suprapersonal thoughts
feelings and aspirations



albert einstein as a selfprofessed adherent of humanism and
rationalism likewise viewed an enlightened religious person as one
whose conscience reflects that he has to the best of his ability
liberated himself from the fetters of his selfish desires and is
preoccupied with thoughts feelings and aspirations to which he clings
because of their superpersonal value

128 einstein often referred
to the inner voice as a source of both moral and physical knowledge
quantum mechanics is very impressive

 but an inner voice tells me that
it is not the real thing

 the theory produces a good deal but hardly
brings one closer to the secrets of the old one

 i am at all events
convinced that he does not play dice

129

simone weil who fought for the french resistance the maquis argued in
her final book the need for roots prelude to a declaration of duties
towards mankind that for society to become more just and protective of
liberty obligations should take precedence over rights in moral and
political philosophy and a spiritual awakening should occur in the
conscience of most citizens so that social obligations are viewed as
fundamentally having a transcendent origin and a beneficent impact on
human character when fulfilled

130131 simone weil also in that
work provided a psychological explanation for the mental peace
associated with a good conscience the liberty of men of goodwill
though limited in the sphere of action is complete in that of
conscience

 for having incorporated the rules into their own being the
prohibited possibilities no longer present themselves to the mind and
have not to be rejected

132

alternatives to such metaphysical and idealist opinions about conscience
arose from realist and materialist perspectives such as those of charles
darwin

 darwin suggested that any animal whatever endowed with
wellmarked social instincts the parental and filial affections being
here included would inevitably acquire a moral sense or conscience as
soon as its intellectual powers had become as well or as nearly as well
developed as in man

133 émile durkheim held that the soul and
conscience were particular forms of an impersonal principle diffused in
the relevant group and communicated by totemic ceremonies

134 a

 j


ayer was a more recent realist who held that the existence of conscience
was an empirical question to be answered by sociological research into
the moral habits of a given person or group of people and what causes
them to have precisely those habits and feelings

 such an inquiry he
believed fell wholly within the scope of the existing social
sciences

135 george edward moore bridged the idealistic and
sociological views of critical and traditional conscience in stating
that the idea of abstract rightness and the various degrees of the
specific emotion excited by it are what constitute for many persons
the specifically moral sentiment or conscience

 for others however
an action seems to be properly termed internally right merely because
they have previously regarded it as right the idea of rightness being
present in some way to his or her mind but not necessarily among his or
her deliberately constructed motives

136

the french philosopher simone de beauvoir in a very easy death une mort
très douce 1964 reflects within her own conscience about her mother s
attempts to develop such a moral sympathy and understanding of
others

137

 the sight of her tears grieved me but i soon realised that she was
 weeping over her failure without caring about what was happening
 inside me 





 we might still have come to an understanding if instead
 of asking everybody to pray for my soul she had given me a little
 confidence and sympathy

 i know now what prevented her from doing so
 she had too much to pay back too many wounds to salve to put herself
 in another s place

 in actual doing she made every sacrifice but her
 feelings did not take her out of herself

 besides how could she have
 tried to understand me since she avoided looking into her own heart


 as for discovering an attitude that would not have set us apart
 nothing in her life had ever prepared her for such a thing the
 unexpected sent her into a panic because she had been taught never to
 think act or feel except in a readymade framework

michael walzer claimed that the growth of religious toleration in
western nations arose amongst other things from the general recognition
that private conscience signified some inner divine presence regardless
of the religious faith professed and from the general respectability
piety selflimitation and sectarian discipline which marked most of
the men who claimed the rights of conscience

138 walzer also argued
that attempts by courts to define conscience as a merely personal moral
code or as sincere belief risked encouraging an anarchy of moral
egotisms unless such a code and motive was necessarily tempered with
shared moral knowledge derived either from the connection of the
individual to a universal spiritual order or from the common principles
and mutual engagements of unselfish people

139 ronald dworkin
maintains that constitutional protection of freedom of conscience is
central to democracy but creates personal duties to live up to it
freedom of conscience presupposes a personal responsibility of
reflection and it loses much of its meaning when that responsibility is
ignored

 a good life need not be an especially reflective one most of
the best lives are just lived rather than studied

 but there are moments
that cry out for selfassertion when a passive bowing to fate or a
mechanical decision out of deference or convenience is treachery
because it forfeits dignity for ease

140 edward conze stated it is
important for individual and collective moral growth that we recognise
the illusion of our conscience being wholly located in our body indeed
both our conscience and wisdom expand when we act in an unselfish way
and conversely repressed compassion results in an unconscious sense of
guilt

141



peter singer distinguished between immature traditional and highly
reasoned critical conscience

the philosopher peter singer considers that usually when we describe an
action as conscientious in the critical sense we do so in order to deny
either that the relevant agent was motivated by selfish desires like
greed or ambition or that he acted on whim or impulse

142

moral antirealists debate whether the moral facts necessary to activate
conscience supervene on natural facts with a posteriori necessity or
arise a priori because moral facts have a primary intension and
naturally identical worlds may be presumed morally identical

143 it
has also been argued that there is a measure of moral luck in how
circumstances create the obstacles which conscience must overcome to
apply moral principles or human rights and that with the benefit of
enforceable property rights and the rule of law access to universal
health care plus the absence of high adult and infant mortality from
conditions such as malaria tuberculosis hivaids and famine people in
relatively prosperous developed countries have been spared pangs of
conscience associated with the physical necessity to steal scraps of
food bribe tax inspectors or police officers and commit murder in
guerrilla wars against corrupt government forces or rebel
armies

144 roger scruton has claimed that true understanding of
conscience and its relationship with morality has been hampered by an
impetuous belief that philosophical questions are solved through the
analysis of language in an area where clarity threatens vested
interests

145 susan sontag similarly argued that it was a symptom
of psychological immaturity not to recognise that many morally immature
people willingly experience a form of delight in some an erotic
breaking of taboo when witnessing violence suffering and pain being
inflicted on others

146 jonathan glover wrote that most of us do
not spend our lives on endless landscape gardening of our self and our
conscience is likely shaped not so much by heroic struggles as by
choice of partner friends and job as well as where we choose to
live

147 garrett hardin in a famous article called the tragedy of
the commons argues that any instance in which society appeals to an
individual exploiting a commons to restrain himself or herself for the
general good—by means of his or her conscience—merely sets up a system
which by selectively diverting societal power and physical resources to
those lacking in conscience while fostering guilt including anxiety
about his or her individual contribution to overpopulation in people
acting upon it actually works toward the elimination of conscience from
the race

john ralston saul consumers risk turning over their conscience to
technical experts and to the ideology of free markets

john ralston saul expressed the view in the unconscious civilization
that in contemporary developed nations many people have acquiesced in
turning over their sense of right and wrong their critical conscience
to technical experts willingly restricting their moral freedom of
choice to limited consumer actions ruled by the ideology of the free
market while citizen participation in public affairs is limited to the
isolated act of voting and privateinterest lobbying turns even elected
representatives against the public interest

150

some argue on religious or philosophical grounds that it is blameworthy
to act against conscience even if the judgement of conscience is likely
to be erroneous say because it is inadequately informed about the
facts or prevailing moral humanist or religious professional
ethical legal and human rights norms

151 failure to acknowledge
and accept that conscientious judgements can be seriously mistaken may
only promote situations where one s conscience is manipulated by others
to provide unwarranted justifications for nonvirtuous and selfish acts
indeed insofar as it is appealed to as glorifying ideological content
and an associated extreme level of devotion without adequate constraint
of external altruistic normative justification conscience may be
considered morally blind and dangerous both to the individual concerned
and humanity as a whole

152 langston argues that philosophers of
virtue ethics have unnecessarily neglected conscience for once
conscience is trained so that the principles and rules it applies are
those one would want all others to live by its practise cultivates and
sustains the virtues indeed amongst people in what each society
considers to be the highest state of moral development there is little
disagreement about how to act

8 emmanuel levinas viewed conscience
as a revelatory encountering of resistance to our selfish powers
developing morality by calling into question our naive sense of freedom
of will to use such powers arbitrarily or with violence this process
being more severe the more rigorously the goal of our self was to obtain
control

153 in other words the welcoming of the other to levinas
was the very essence of conscience properly conceived it encouraged our
ego to accept the fallibility of assuming things about other people
that selfish freedom of will does not have the last word and that
realising this has a transcendent purpose i am not alone 





 in
conscience i have an experience that is not commensurate with any a
priori see a priori and a posteriori frameworka conceptless
experience

john rawls in his a theory of justice defines a conscientious objector
as an individual prepared to undertake in public and often despite
widespread condemnation an action of civil disobedience to a legal
rule justifying it also in public by reference to contrary
foundational social virtues such as justice as liberty or fairness and
the principles of morality and law derived from them

160 rawls
considered civil disobedience should be viewed as an appeal warning or
admonishment showing general respect and fidelity to the rule of law by
the nonviolence and transparency of methods adopted that a law
breaches a community s fundamental virtue of justice

160 objections
to rawls theory include first its inability to accommodate
conscientious objections to the society s basic appreciation of justice
or to emerging moral or ethical principles such as respect for the
rights of the natural environment which are not yet part of it and
second the difficulty of predictably and consistently determining that
a majority decision is just or unjust

161 conscientious objection
also called conscientious refusal or evasion to obeying a law should
not arise from unreasoning naive traditional conscience for to do so
merely encourages infantile abdication of responsibility to calibrate
the law against moral or human rights norms and disrespect for
democratic institutions

162 instead it should be based on critical
conscience – seriously thought out conceptually mature personal moral
or religious beliefs held to be fundamentally incompatible that is not
merely inconsistent on the basis of selfish desires whim or impulse
for example either with all laws requiring conscription for military
service or legal compulsion to fight for or financially support the
state in a particular war

163 a famous example arose when henry
david thoreau the author of walden was willingly jailed for refusing to
pay a tax because he profoundly disagreed with a government policy and
was frustrated by the corruption and injustice of the democratic
machinery of the state

164 a more recent case concerned kimberly
rivera a private in the us army and mother of four children who having
served three months in iraq war decided the conflict was immoral and
sought refugee status in canada in 2012 see list of iraq war
resisters but was deported and arrested in the us

henry david thoreau must the citizen ever for a moment or in the least
degree resign his conscience to the legislator



 unjust laws exist shall we be content to obey them or shall we
 endeavour to amend them and obey them until we have succeeded or
 shall we transgress them at once

 





 a man has not everything to do
 but something and because he cannot do everything it is not
 necessary that he should do something wrong 





 it is for no
 particular item in the tax bill that i refuse to pay it

 i simply wish
 to refuse allegiance to the state to withdraw and stand aloof from it
 effectually

 i do not care to trace the course of my dollar if i
 could till it buys a man or a musket to shoot one with—the dollar is
 innocent—but i am concerned to trace the effects of my allegiance 






 must the citizen ever for a moment or in the least degree resign his
 conscience to the legislator

 why has every man a conscience then

in the second world war great britain granted conscientiousobjection
status not just to complete pacifists but to those who objected to
fighting in that particular war this was done partly out of genuine
respect but also to avoid the disgraceful and futile persecutions of
conscientious objectors that occurred during the first world
war

166

amnesty international organises campaigns to protect those arrested and
or incarcerated as a prisoner of conscience because of their
conscientious beliefs particularly concerning intellectual political
and artistic freedom of expression and association

167 aung san suu
kyi of burma was the winner of the 2009 amnesty international
ambassador of conscience award

 in legislation a conscience clause is a
provision in a statute that excuses a health professional from complying
with the law for example legalising surgical or pharmaceutical
abortion if it is incompatible with religious or conscientious
beliefs

168 expressed justifications for refusing to obey laws
because of conscience vary

 many conscientious objectors are so for
religious reasons—notably members of the historic peace churches are
pacifist by doctrine

 other objections can stem from a deep sense of
responsibility toward humanity as a whole or from the conviction that
even acceptance of work under military orders acknowledges the principle
of conscription that should be everywhere condemned before the world can
ever become safe for real democracy

169 a conscientious objector
however does not have a primary aim of changing the law

160 john
dewey considered that conscientious objectors were often the victims of
moral innocency and inexpertness in moral training the moving force
of events is always too much for conscience

170 the remedy was not
to deplore the wickedness of those who manipulate world power but to
connect conscience with forces moving in another direction to build
institutions and social environments predicated on the rule of law for
example then will conscience itself have compulsive power instead of
being forever the martyred and the coerced

170 as an example
albert einstein who had advocated conscientious objection during the
first world war and had been a longterm supporter of war resisters 
international reasoned that radical pacifism could not be justified in
the face of nazi rearmament and advocated a world federalist
organization with its own professional army

171 samuel johnson
pointed out that an appeal to conscience should not allow the law to
bring unjust suffering upon another

 conscience according to johnson
was nothing more than a conviction felt by ourselves of something to be
done or something to be avoided in questions of simple unperplexed
morality conscience is very often a guide that may be trusted

172
but before conscience can conclusively determine what morally should be
done he thought that the state of the question should be thoroughly
known

172 no man s conscience said johnson can tell him the
right of another man 





 it is a conscience very ill informed that
violates the rights of one man for the convenience of another

civil disobedience as nonviolent protest or civil resistance are also
acts of conscience but are designed by those who undertake them chiefly
to change by appealing to the majority and democratic processes laws
or government policies perceived to be incoherent with fundamental
social virtues and principles such as justice equality or respect for
intrinsic human dignity

173 civil disobedience in a properly
functioning democracy allows a minority who feel strongly that a law
infringes their sense of justice but have no capacity to obtain
legislative amendments or a referendum on the issue to make a
potentially apathetic or uninformed majority take account of the
intensity of opposing views

174 a notable example of civil
resistance or satyagraha satya in sanskrit means truth and
compassion agraha means firmness of will involved mahatma gandhi
making salt in india when that act was prohibited by a british statute
in order to create moral pressure for law reform

189 conscientious
noncompliance may be the only practical option for citizens wishing to
affirm the existence of an international moral order or core 
historical rights such as the right to life right to a fair trial and
freedom of opinion in states where nonviolent protest or civil
disobedience are met with prolonged arbitrary detention torture forced
disappearance murder or persecution

world conscience

edit

further information comparative religion universalism world
government cosmopolitanism and common heritage of humanity

world conscience is the universalist idea that with ready global
communication all people on earth will no longer be morally estranged
from one another whether it be culturally ethnically or
geographically instead they will conceive ethics from the utopian point
of view of the universe eternity or infinity rather than have their
duties and obligations defined by forces arising solely within the
restrictive boundaries of blood and territory

5

often this derives from a spiritual or natural law perspective that for
world peace to be achieved conscience properly understood should be
generally considered as not necessarily linked often destructively to
fundamentalist religious ideologies but as an aspect of universal
consciousness access to which is the common heritage of
humanity

192 thinking predicated on the development of world
conscience is common to members of the global ecovillage network such as
the findhorn foundation international conservation organisations like
fauna and flora international as well as performers of world music such
as alan stivell

193 nongovernment organizations particularly
through their work in agendasetting policymaking and implementation
of human rightsrelated policy have been referred to as the conscience
of the world194

edward o wilson has developed the idea of consilience to encourage
coherence of global moral and scientific knowledge supporting the
premise that only unified learning universally shared makes accurate
foresight and wise choice possible

195 thus world conscience is a
concept that overlaps with the gaia hypothesis in advocating a balance
of moral legal scientific and economic solutions to modern
transnational problems such as global poverty and global warming
through strategies such as environmental ethics climate ethics natural
conservation ecology cosmopolitanism sustainability and sustainable
development biosequestration and legal protection of the biosphere and
biodiversity

underwater american nuclear test in the pacific

 worldwide expressions
of conscience against such explosions caused the french government to
cease atmospheric tests at mururoa for political reasons



the american cardiologist bernard lown and the russian cardiologist
yevgeniy chazov were motivated in conscience through studying the
catastrophic public health consequences of nuclear war in establishing
international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war ippnw which
was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1985 and continues to work to heal
an ailing planet

206
worldwide expressions of conscience contributed to the decision of the
french government to halt atmospheric nuclear tests at mururoa in the
pacific in 1974 after 41 such explosions although belowground nuclear
tests continued there into the 1990s

207

a challenge to world conscience was provided by an influential 1968
article by garrett hardin that critically analyzed the dilemma in which
multiple individuals acting independently after rationally consulting
selfinterest and he claimed the apparently low
 survivalofthefittest value of conscienceled actions ultimately
destroy a shared limited resource even though each acknowledges such an
outcome is not in anyone s longterm interest

148 hardin s
conclusion that commons areas are practicably achievable only in
conditions of low population density and so their continuance requires
state restriction on the freedom to breed created controversy
additionally through his direct deprecation of the role of conscience in
achieving individual decisions policies and laws that facilitate global
justice and peace as well as sustainability and sustainable development
of world commons areas for example including those officially
designated such under united nations treaties see common heritage of
humanity

208 areas designated common heritage of humanity under
international law include the moon outer space deep sea bed
antarctica the world cultural and natural heritage see world heritage
convention and the human genome

209 it will be a significant
challenge for world conscience that as world oil coal mineral timber
agricultural and water reserves are depleted there will be increasing
pressure to commercially exploit common heritage of mankind

darfur refugee camp in chad a challenge to the world s conscience



the philosopher peter singer has argued that the united nations
millennium development goals represent the emergence of an ethics based
not on national boundaries but on the idea of one world

211 ninian
smart has similarly predicted that the increase in global travel and
communication will gradually draw the world s religions towards a
pluralistic and transcendental humanism characterized by an open
spirit of empathy and compassion

212



sombrero galaxy a united nations treaty declares outer space the common
heritage of humanity

 garrett hardin doubted the capacity of conscience
to protect such commons areas

noam chomsky has argued that forces opposing the development of such a
world conscience include free market ideologies that valorise corporate
greed in nominal electoral democracies where advertising shopping malls
and indebtedness shape citizens into apathetic consumers in relation to
information and access necessary for democratic participation

213
john passmore has argued that mystical considerations about the global
expansion of all human consciousness should take into account that if
as a species we do become something much superior to what we are now it
will be as a consequence of conscience not only implanting a goal of
moral perfectibility but assisting us to remain periodically anxious
passionate and discontented for these are necessary components of care
and compassion

214 the committee on conscience of the us holocaust
memorial museum has targeted genocides such as those in rwanda bosnia
darfur the congo and chechnya as challenges to the world s
conscience

215 oscar arias sanchez has criticised global arms
industry spending as a failure of conscience by nation states when a
country decides to invest in arms rather than in education housing
the environment and health services for its people it is depriving a
whole generation of its right to prosperity and happiness

 we have
produced one firearm for every ten inhabitants of this planet and yet
we have not bothered to end hunger when such a feat is well within our
reach

 this is not a necessary or inevitable state of affairs

 it is a
deliberate choice see campaign against arms trade

krishna about his spiritual duty work as though you are performing a

the critic a

 bradley discusses the central problem of shakespeare s
tragic character hamlet as one where conscience in the form of moral
scruples deters the young prince with his great anxiety to do right
from obeying his father s hellbound ghost and murdering the usurping
king is t not perfect conscience to quit him with this arm


v

264

bradley develops a theory about hamlet s moral agony relating to a
conflict between traditional and critical conscience the
conventional moral ideas of his time which he shared with the ghost
told him plainly that he ought to avenge his father but a deeper
conscience in him which was in advance of his time contended with
these explicit conventional ideas

 it is because this deeper conscience
remains below the surface that he fails to recognise it and fancies he
is hindered by cowardice or sloth or passion or what not but it emerges
into light in that speech to horatio

 and it is just because he has this
nobler moral nature in him that we admire and love him

265 the
opening words of shakespeare s sonnet 94 they that have pow r to hurt
and will do none have been admired as a description of
conscience

anton chekhov in his plays the seagull uncle vanya and three sisters
describes the tortured emotional states of doctors who at some point in
their careers have turned their back on conscience

268 in his short
stories chekhov also explored how people misunderstood the voice of a
tortured conscience

 a promiscuous student for example in the fit
describes it as a dull pain indefinite vague it was like anguish and
the most acute fear and despair 





 in his breast under the heart and
the young doctor examining the misunderstood agony of compassion
experienced by the factory owner s daughter in from a case book calls it
an unknown mysterious power 





 in fact close at hand and watching
him

269 characteristically chekhov s own conscience drove him on
the long journey to sakhalin to record and alleviate the harsh
conditions of the prisoners at that remote outpost

 as irina
ratushinskaya writes in the introduction to that work abandoning
everything he travelled to the distant island of sakhalin the most
feared place of exile and forced labour in russia at that time

 one
cannot help but wonder why

 simply because the lot of the people there
was a bitter one because nobody really knew about the lives and deaths
of the exiles because he felt that they stood in greater need of help
that anyone else

 a strange reason maybe but not for a writer who was
the epitome of all the best traditions of a russian man of letters


russian literature has always focused on questions of conscience and
was therefore a powerful force in the moulding of public
opinion

 carr writes of dostoevsky s character the young student
raskolnikov in the novel crime and punishment who decides to murder a
 vile and loathsome old woman money lender on the principle of

given us but the tragic and fruitless struggle of a powerful intellect
to maintain a conviction which is incompatible with the essential nature
of man
