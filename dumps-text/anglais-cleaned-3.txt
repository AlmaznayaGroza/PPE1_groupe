Introduction

In
this
essay
I
explore
Adam
Smith’s
analysis
of
the
origins
of
conscience
and
general
moral
rules
in
The
Theory
of
Moral
Sentiments
.


I
argue
that
Adam
Smith
offers
a
distinction
between
moral
conscience
and
general
moral
rules
that
sidesteps
the
traditional
distinction
between
universal
and
relative
moral
standards
,
leading
to
a
fundamental
rethinking
of
the
problem
of
the
variability
of
moral
opinion
and
the
demands
of
moral
conscience
and
duty
.



Moral
Conscience

Like
the
thought
of
his
mentor
Francis
Hutcheson
and
of
his
friend
David
Hume
,
Smith’s
moral
theory
is
rooted
in
an
analysis
of
the
workings
of
our
moral
sentiments
.


In
its
barest
form
,
Smith’s
argument
is
that
we
judge
others
when
we
use
our
imaginations
to
put
ourselves
into
their
situation
and
bring
their
case
home
to
us
.

1
Either
we
do
or
do
not
sympathize
with
the
sentiments
and
motives
guiding
the
actions
of
the
person
we
are
observing
.


When
the
sentiments
sparked
in
the
spectator
are
congruent
with
those
found
in
the
agent
,
we
approve
of
another’s
actions
or
character
as
being
appropriate
.

2
When
they
do
not
,
we
condemn
them
as
inappropriate
.


Moral
judgment
thus
arises
from
how
we
feel
about
a
particular
situation
that
we
,
as
spectators
,
are
observing
.


In
order
to
correct
for
any
biases
that
might
intrude
into
our
moral
judgment
from
either
our
interests
or
our
passions
,
Smith
argues
that
we
must
assume
the
so-called
“impartial
spectator”
position
for
viewing
others’
actions
and
motives
.

3
Our
senses
of
propriety
and
impropriety
,
as
well
as
of
merit
and
demerit
,
follow
from
our
observations
and
judgments
as
spectators
of
ourselves
and
other
people
,
with
the
adoption
of
an
impartial
spectator
position
to
correct
for
any
bias
in
our
judgments
.



Smith’s
notion
of
moral
conscience
follows
directly
from
this
general
approach
.


He
believes
we
cultivate
a
moral
conscience
by
learning
to
view
ourselves
,
our
intentions
and
our
actions
from
a
position
of
impartial
spectatorship
.


From
this
position
,
we
cultivate
a
concern
with
praiseworthiness
and
blameworthiness
,
not
praise
and
blame
.


Being
virtuous
and
having
a
fully
developed
moral
conscience
for
Smith
represents
the
highest
stage
in
the
moral
development
of
an
individual
.



General
Rules
and
Duty

Early
in
The
Theory
of
Moral
Sentiments
Smith
appears
to
be
confident
in
our
ability
to
form
moral
judgments
.


A
more
cautious
attitude
emerges
at
the
beginning
of
Chapter
Four
of
Part
III
of
The
Theory
of
Moral
Sentiments
.


The
impartial
spectator
,
it
seems
,
is
no
longer
enough
to
help
individuals
make
moral
judgments
in
the
real
world
.

4
Smith
begins
the
chapter
by
noting
that
the
impartial
spectator
has
its
limitations
in
the
world
of
action
.


We
may
try
to
view
our
own
conduct
from
the
perspective
of
the
impartial
spectator
both
before
and
after
we
do
something
.


But
our
passions
and
emotions
can
affect
the
way
we
examine
ourselves
and
often
lead
us
to
mistaken
judgments
in
both
circumstances
.


In
general
,
it
is
easier
to
resist
this
partiality
after
the
fact
,
when
our
passions
and
emotions
have
subsided
and
no
longer
dominate
our
moral
perception
of
the
world
.


Our
ability
to
resist
the
partiality
of
the
passions
before
an
action
is
more
problematic
.


We
may
want
something
so
badly
that
we
are
unable
to
make
a
good
decision
about
what
should
be
done
.


Our
passions
want
what
they
want
,
and
there
may
be
nothing
that
we
can
do
about
it
.

5

Smith
labels
this
partiality
brought
into
moral
judgment
by
the
passions
and
emotion
“self-deceit
,”
and
claims
that
it
the
“fatal
weakness
of
mankind
,”
“the
source
of
half
the
disorders
of
human
life”
(TMS
:
158
)
.


The
solution
that
“Nature”
appears
to
have
devised
to
the
problem
of
self-deceit
comes
in
the
form
of
general
rules
concerning
what
is
fit
and
proper
to
do
and
what
must
be
avoided
.


The
psychological
source
of
these
general
rules
that
we
use
to
guide
our
judgments
about
ourselves
is
surprising
.


They
do
not
arise
from
our
observations
of
our
own
behavior
,
but
from
our
observations
of
the
behavior
of
others
.


As
Smith
explains
,
“Our
continual
observations
upon
the
conduct
of
others
,
insensibly
lead
us
to
form
to
ourselves
certain
general
rules
concerning
what
is
fit
and
proper
either
to
be
done
or
to
be
avoided”
(TMS
:
159
)
.


The
specific
mechanism
by
which
these
rules
are
formed
is
considerably
different
from
the
cultivation
of
conscience
.


Take
the
emergence
of
negative
rules
or
commands
that
order
us
not
to
do
something
.


We
observe
another’s
behavior
and
disapprove
of
it
.


We
hear
others
express
similar
sentiments
,
and
this
confirms
and
reinforces
our
earlier
judgment
.


We
resolve
never
to
be
guilty
of
similar
actions
and
exposed
to
similar
disapprobation
.


“We
thus
naturally
lay
down
to
ourselves
a
general
rule
,
that
all
such
actions
are
to
be
avoided
,
as
tending
to
render
us
odious
,
contemptible
,
or
punishable
,
the
objects
of
all
those
sentiments
for
which
we
have
the
greatest
dread
and
aversion”
(TMS
:
159
)
.


In
other
words
,
general
moral
rules
are
formed
out
of
our
judgments
of
particular
experiences
that
we
observe
in
conjunction
with
the
judgments
of
others
.


A
desire
for
praise
or
an
aversion
to
blame
,
not
the
moral
conscience’s
concern
for
praiseworthiness
or
aversion
to
blameworthiness
,
compels
us
to
develop
them
.


After
these
general
rules
are
formed
and
“universally
acknowledged
and
established
by
the
concurring
sentiments
of
mankind
,”
they
are
seen
to
be
standards
of
judgment
for
evaluating
other
events
in
the
world
(TMS
:
160
)
.



This
view
of
the
origins
of
general
moral
rules
carries
four
important
consequences
.


First
,
it
explains
the
tools
available
to
individuals
for
escaping
the
limitations
of
the
moral
sentiments
when
judging
oneself
.


Rather
than
trying
to
control
or
curtail
one’s
passions
and
emotions
,
an
individual
can
use
general
rules
through
“habitual
reflection”
as
a
way
to
escape
the
misrepresentations
of
self-love
and
other
passions
.


The
rules
are
standards
against
which
we
can
judge
our
actions
before
the
fact
and
decide
if
they
are
appropriate
behavior
or
not
.


Second
,
this
view
helps
account
for
the
enormous
variability
in
moral
rules
across
different
cultures
and
historical
periods
.


There
is
no
guarantee
that
different
societies
will
adopt
the
same
general
rules
for
overcoming
the
limitations
of
moral
judgment
in
real
individuals
.


Third
,
this
account
helps
explain
how
moral
rules
themselves
can
become
the
objects
of
moral
judgments
.


Individuals
come
to
approve
of
general
rules
as
being
a
good
thing
for
society
to
the
point
that
they
may
believe
that
they
have
a
foundation
independent
of
our
moral
sentiments
.


History
is
replete
with
examples
of
peoples
claiming
their
rules
were
given
to
them
by
divine
authority
.


Our
natural
sense
of
duty
may
be
reinforced
by
a
mistaken
notion
of
the
universality
of
the
moral
standards
that
have
emerged
in
the
society
in
which
we
live
.


Finally
,
this
view
explains
how
tensions
arise
when
the
judgments
of
our
moral
conscience
might
be
displaced
or
,
at
least
,
come
into
conflict
with
the
general
rules
that
are
established
in
a
particular
society
and
to
which
we
feel
deep
sentimental
attachments
.


In
Smith’s
world
,
there
is
no
guarantee
that
the
conclusions
of
our
sense
of
moral
conscience
will
dovetail
neatly
into
our
sense
of
duty
.



The
Sense
of
Duty

Smith’s
conclusions
about
the
difference
between
the
dictates
of
moral
conscience
and
our
sense
of
duty
to
obey
general
rules
are
profound
.


Virtuous
individuals
guided
by
moral
conscience
cultivate
the
feelings
that
are
appropriate
to
particular
situations
.


For
example
,
when
confronted
with
the
benevolent
behavior
of
another
,
they
feel
gratitude
towards
that
person
and
act
appropriately
.


A
person
educated
to
one’s
duty
may
never
feel
the
appropriate
sentiment
of
gratitude
.


But
they
may
learn
to
act
appropriately
,
based
on
their
regard
for
the
rules
of
gratitude
established
in
their
society
.


“The
motive
of
his
actions
,”
Smith
explains
,
“may
be
no
other
than
a
reverence
for
the
established
rule
of
duty
,
as
serious
and
earnest
desire
of
acting
,
in
every
respect
,
according
to
the
law
of
gratitude”
(TMS
:
162
)
.


A
regard
for
the
general
rules
of
society
may
be
a
second-best
option
for
human
beings
trying
to
live
together
with
one
another
.


Acting
from
a
sense
of
duty
may
not
point
one
to
the
most
complete
perfection
of
one’s
moral
character
.


But
it
does
give
rise
to
a
society
where
individuals
can
treat
one
another
with
a
“tolerable
decency
,”
and
,
for
most
of
one’s
life
,
be
able
“to
avoid
any
considerable
degree
of
blame”
(TMS
:
163
)
.


More
to
the
point
,
our
sense
of
duty
may
be
more
important
than
our
sentiments
for
virtue
.


“Without
this
sacred
regard
to
general
rules
,
there
is
no
man
whose
conduct
can
be
much
depended
upon”
(TMS
:
163
)
.



The
Tension
between
Conscience
and
Duty

For
Smith
,
humans
are
subject
to
multiple
commands
in
ethics
,
some
stemming
from
the
dictates
of
conscience
and
others
from
duty
.


When
should
the
principle
of
duty
be
the
sole
principle
regulating
our
conduct
in
the
world
,
and
when
should
it
concur
with
other
motives
such
as
those
provided
by
moral
conscience
?


Conscience
and
duty
introduce
tension
into
Smith’s
understanding
of
moral
judgement
and
action
in
The
Theory
of
Moral
Sentiments
.


Understanding
that
tension
between
the
demands
of
conscience
and
duty
lies
at
the
heart
of
the
final
chapter
of
Part
VI
.



Some
moral
judgements
are
guided
primarily
by
moral
conscience
;
others
are
guided
by
general
rules
and
our
sense
of
duty
.


Given
the
characteristics
of
a
particular
passion
,
individuals
may
face
a
difficult
task
of
balancing
between
the
demands
of
conscience
and
of
duty
.


For
example
,
regarding
benevolent
and
social
sentiments
like
love
,
our
moral
judgements
and
actions
flow
naturally
from
our
benevolent
sentiments
.


Our
sense
of
duty
can
be
employed
to
watch
over
and
moderate
excessive
benevolence
.


On
the
whole
,
the
benevolent
side
of
our
moral
character
can
be
trusted
to
work
appropriately
.


With
regard
to
malevolent
and
unsocial
passions
such
as
resentment
and
anger
,
however
,
moral
judgement
and
action
should
proceed
entirely
from
a
sense
of
duty
,
the
passions
themselves
being
too
dangerous
to
allow
unlimited
play
as
a
motive
to
our
actions
.


Selfish
passions
are
even
more
complicated
.


Our
ordinary
private
interest
ought
to
flow
from
a
regard
to
the
general
rules
,
not
from
the
objects
themselves
.


But
another
,
quite
different
,
conclusion
is
reached
regarding
the
“extraordinary
and
important
objects
of
self-interest”
involving
advancement
and
social
recognition
(TMS
:
173
)
.


Humans
recognize
that
the
actions
of
a
prince
in
war
,
a
member
of
parliament
seeking
reelection
,
or
a
tradesman
seeking
a
special
job
,
must
be
grounded
,
at
least
in
part
,
by
the
passion
of
ambition
,
and
not
just
duty
or
conscience
,
for
successful
advancement
and
social
recognition
.



A
second
issue
that
follows
from
the
distinction
between
conscience
and
duty
involves
the
precision
and
exactness
of
the
general
moral
rules
themselves
.


Some
rules
are
clearer
and
more
important
to
society
than
others
.


For
example
,
Smith
argues
that
the
rules
of
such
virtues
as
prudence
,
charity
,
generosity
,
gratitude
and
friendship
“are
in
many
respects
loose
and
inaccurate
,
admit
of
many
exceptions
,
and
require
so
many
modifications
,
that
it
is
scarce
possible
to
regulate
our
conduct
entirely
by
a
regard
for
them”
(TMS
:
174
)
.


In
contrast
,
the
rules
of
justice
are
accurate
to
the
highest
degree
and
admit
of
no
exceptions
.

6
When
we
practice
the
former
virtue
,
sentiment
should
be
allowed
to
predominate
rather
than
a
specific
regard
for
any
particular
rule
.


“But
it
is
otherwise
with
regard
to
justice
:
the
man
who
in
that
refines
the
least
,
and
adheres
with
the
most
obstinate
stedfastness
to
the
general
rules
themselves
,
is
the
most
commendable
,
and
the
most
to
be
depended
on”
(TMS
:
175
)
.



Given
its
importance
to
human
society
,
it
is
not
surprising
that
Smith
sees
other
sentiments
in
our
nature
bolstering
our
sense
of
duty
,
particularly
the
religious
sentiment
.


Even
in
its
crudest
form
,
“during
the
ignorance
and
darkness
of
pagan
superstition
,”
religion
gave
support
to
the
rules
of
morality
.


People
believed
that
the
gods
could
be
appealed
to
in
order
to
reward
the
good
and
punish
the
bad
.


Similarly
,
our
natural
sense
of
religion
supports
our
natural
sense
of
duty
by
convincing
us
that
the
general
rules
of
morality
“are
to
be
regarded
as
the
commands
and
laws
of
the
Deity
,
promulgated
by
those
vicegerents
which
he
has
thus
set
up
within
us”
(TMS
:
165
)
.


There
is
a
darker
side
to
religion’s
place
in
our
moral
life
.


Religion
may
complement
the
teaching
of
our
natural
sentiments
and
reinforce
the
importance
of
our
sense
of
duty
.


False
religion
may
pervert
our
natural
sentiments
and
distort
our
notions
of
duty
beyond
recognition
(TMS
:
176
)
.



The
linkage
drawn
by
Smith
between
the
general
rules
of
morality
and
“the
commands
and
laws
of
the
Deity”
is
one
of
the
most
confusing
in
The
Theory
of
Moral
Sentiments
and
remains
prone
to
misinterpretation
.


One
might
easily
argue
that
what
Smith
means
to
say
is
that
the
conclusions
of
conscience
are
the
general
laws
of
morality
backed
by
our
religious
sentiment
.


From
this
interpretation
,
conscience
can
easily
be
identified
as
“vicegerents
of
God”
that
reward
us
for
following
the
law
and
punish
us
for
breaking
it
.


If
my
reading
of
the
sharp
distinction
between
duty
and
conscience
is
correct
,
this
reading
is
seriously
mistaken
.


As
I
argue
above
,
our
general
rules
of
morality
are
generalizations
based
upon
our
observations
of
our
moral
judgments
in
conjunction
with
those
of
others
.


They
are
not
conclusions
of
our
moral
conscience
.


Conscience
deals
with
the
problem
of
praiseworthiness
,
duty
centers
upon
the
problem
of
praise
.


All
people
have
the
capacity
for
moral
generalization
.


All
people
do
not
have
a
highly
functioning
moral
sense
of
conscience
.


The
“vicegerents
of
God”
that
Smith
is
referring
to
are
not
just
the
sentiments
involved
with
conscience
.


They
encompass
all
our
moral
faculties
,
including
our
sense
of
propriety
and
impropriety
,
our
sense
of
merit
and
demerit
,
and
our
sense
of
duty
.



The
significance
of
the
distinction
between
conscience
and
duty
in
Smith’s
thought
is
revealed
most
clearly
at
the
end
of
Chapter
V
in
Part
III
.


Smith
emphasizes
that
while
he
wants
to
distinguish
between
duty
and
conscience
,
he
does
not
want
to
say
they
are
necessarily
antithetical
to
one
another
.


On
the
contrary
,
for
the
most
part
they
complement
one
another
.


He
comments
that
“the
general
rules
by
which
external
prosperity
and
adversity
are
commonly
distributed
in
this
life”
tend
to
encourage
and
promote
virtue
.


Prudence
is
rewarded
with
success
in
business
.


Humanity
is
rewarded
in
our
private
lives
with
love
.


But
there
are
times
when
some
of
our
natural
sentiments
fly
in
the
face
of
general
rules
by
which
society
is
governed
.


Smith
explains
,


The
industrious
knave
cultivates
the
soil
;
the
indolent
good
man

leaves
it
uncultivated
.


Who
ought
to
reap
the
harvest
?


Who
starve
,
and

who
live
in
plenty
?


The
natural
course
of
things
decides
in
favour
of

the
knave
:
the
natural
sentiments
of
mankind
in
favour
of
the
man
of

virtue
(TMS
:
168
)
.



From
the
perspective
of
duty
,
the
rules
governing
marketplace
activity
,
that
is
property
rights
and
the
like
,
generally
result
in
socially
beneficial
outcomes
.


The
fact
that
wealth
goes
to
the
industrious
knave
rather
than
the
lazy
or
indolent
good
man
is
acceptable
to
our
sense
of
justice
.


But
from
the
perspective
of
our
other
sentiments
that
tell
us
that
goodness
should
be
rewarded
,
another
conclusion
is
sometimes
reached
.


The
efforts
made
by
societies
to
redirect
the
natural
distribution
of
wealth
often
reflect
the
conflicting
demands
that
our
sentiments
make
up
the
world
.


Sometimes
these
demands
are
misconceived
.


As
Smith
notes
,


The
natural
course
of
things
cannot
be
entirely
controlled
by
the

impotent
endeavors
of
man
:
the
current
is
too
rapid
and
too
strong
for

him
to
stop
it
;
and
though
the
rules
of
which
direct
it
appear
to
have

been
established
for
the
wisest
and
best
purpose
,
they
sometimes

produce
effects
which
shock
all
his
natural
sentiments
(TMS
:
168
)
.



There
are
natural
limits
to
what
we
can
do
to
impose
the
teaching
of
our
consciences
upon
the
world
.


But
that
does
not
mean
that
we
must
deny
our
consciences
out
of
hand
.


Indignation
in
the
face
of
perceived
unfairness
is
a
natural
response
of
our
conscience
to
the
world
at
times
.


We
may
not
always
be
able
to
construct
the
world
in
the
way
that
we
wish
,
but
we
do
not
have
to
like
it
at
the
deepest
levels
of
our
being
.


In
the
end
,
humans
live
their
lives
trying
to
balance
the
conflicting
moral
demands
of
duty
and
virtue
as
best
they
can
.

Smith
uses
the
term
sympathy
in
a
number
of
different
ways
,
often

quite
loosely
.


In
one
of
his
broadest
definitions
,
Smith
suggests

that
the
term
may
be
used
“without
much
impropriety
,
be
made
use
of

to
denote
our
fellow-feeling
with
any
passion
whatever
.

”
(TMS
:
10
)

For
the
purposes
in
this
paper
,
sympathy
will
refer
to
our

imaginative
capacity
to
enter
into
the
sentiments
of
others
.

Like
sympathy
,
the
idea
of
the
impartial
spectator
has
sparked

considerable
controversy
in
the
secondary
literature
.


Interestingly
,

in
Parts
II
and
III
Smith
uses
the
concept
of
the
impartial

spectator
without
adequately
explaining
what
he
means
by
it
or
all

the
circumstances
under
which
individuals
might
use
it
.


Elsewhere
I

have
argued
that
the
idea
of
the
impartial
spectator
is
not
any
one

particular
position
for
viewing
and
judging
the
conduct
of
another
.



It
is
not
the
unique
position
of
an
ideal
spectator
.


There
may
be
a

variety
of
impartial
spectator
positions
for
viewing
others
,
equally

“impartial
,”
but
characterized
by
different
capacities
for
moral

judgment
or
even
different
amounts
of
information
available
to
the

spectator
for
making
a
moral
judgment
.

Harpham

“In
order
to
pervert
the
rectitude
of
our
own
judgments
concerning

the
propriety
of
our
own
conduct
,
it
is
not
always
necessary
that

the
real
and
impartial
spectator
should
be
at
a
great
distance
.


When

he
is
at
hand
,
when
he
is
present
,
the
violence
and
injustice
of
our

own
selfish
passions
are
sometimes
sufficient
to
induce
the
man

within
the
breast
to
make
a
report
very
different
from
what
the
real

circumstances
of
the
case
are
capable
of
authorizing”
(TMS
:
157
)
.

This
concern
over
the
partiality
of
the
passions
and
emotions
lies

at
the
heart
of
Smith’s
rejection
of
Francis
Hutcheson’s
theory
of

moral
sense
.


Essentially
Smith’s
argument
is
that
if
we
had
a
moral

sense
,
we
would
be
able
to
judge
our
own
actions
and
sentiments

better
than
we
are
able
to
judge
those
of
others
.


This
,
he
believes
,

is
clearly
not
the
case
and
one
of
the
major
reasons
that
general

rules
emerge
in
society
as
standards
for
measuring
our
own
behavior

against
.


See
TMS
:
158

This
whole
line
of
argument
follows
those
developed
by
Hume
in
Book

III
of
the
Treatise
.


Echoing
his
friends
,
Smith
writes
,
“The
rules

of
justice
may
be
compared
to
the
rules
of
grammar
;
the
rules
of
the

other
virtues
to
the
rules
which
critics
lay
down
for
the
attainment

of
what
is
sublime
and
elegant
in
composition
.


The
one
,
are
precise
,

accurate
an
indispensable
.


The
other
,
are
loose
,
vague
,
and

indeterminate
,
and
present
us
rather
with
a
general
idea
of
the

perfection
we
ought
to
aim
at
,
than
afford
us
any
certain
and

infallible
directions
for
acquiring
it”

:
176-77
)
