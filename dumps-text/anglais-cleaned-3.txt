The
Judgment
of
Conscience

1777
Moral
conscience
,⁴⁸
present
at
the
heart
of
the
person
,
enjoins
him
at
the
appropriate
moment
to
do
good
and
to
avoid
evil
.


It
also
judges
particular
choices
,
approving
those
that
are
good
and
denouncing
those
that
are
evil
.

⁴⁹
It
bears
witness
to
the
authority
of
truth
in
reference
to
the
supreme
Good
to
which
the
human
person
is
drawn
,
and
it
welcomes
the
commandments
.


When
he
listens
to
his
conscience
,
the
prudent
man
can
hear
God
speaking
.



1778
Conscience
is
a
judgment
of
reason
whereby
the
human
person
recognizes
the
moral
quality
of
a
concrete
act
that
he
is
going
to
perform
,
is
in
the
process
of
performing
,
or
has
already
completed
.


In
all
he
says
and
does
,
man
is
obliged
to
follow
faithfully
what
he
knows
to
be
just
and
right
.


It
is
by
the
judgment
of
his
conscience
that
man
perceives
and
recognizes
the
prescriptions
of
the
divine
law
:

Conscience
is
a
law
of
the
mind
;
yet
[Christians]
would
not
grant
that
it
is
nothing
more
;
I
mean
that
it
was
not
a
dictate
,
nor
conveyed
the
notion
of
responsibility
,
of
duty
,
of
a
threat
and
a
promise
.


.


.


.


[Conscience]
is
a
messenger
of
him
,
who
,
both
in
nature
and
in
grace
,
speaks
to
us
behind
a
veil
,
and
teaches
and
rules
us
by
his
representatives
.


Conscience
is
the
aboriginal
Vicar
of
Christ
.

⁵⁰

1779
It
is
important
for
every
person
to
be
sufficiently
present
to
himself
in
order
to
hear
and
follow
the
voice
of
his
conscience
.


This
requirement
of
interiority
is
all
the
more
necessary
as
life
often
distracts
us
from
any
reflection
,
self-examination
or
introspection
:

Return
to
your
conscience
,
question
it
.


.


.


.


Turn
inward
,
brethren
,
and
in
everything
you
do
,
see
God
as
your
witness
.

⁵¹

1780
The
dignity
of
the
human
person
implies
and
requires
uprightness
of
moral
conscience
.


Conscience
includes
the
perception
of
the
principles
of
morality
(synderesis)
;
their
application
in
the
given
circumstances
by
practical
discernment
of
reasons
and
goods
;
and
finally
judgment
about
concrete
acts
yet
to
be
performed
or
already
performed
.


the
truth
about
the
moral
good
,
stated
in
the
law
of
reason
,
is
recognized
practically
and
concretely
by
the
prudent
judgment
of
conscience
.


We
call
that
man
prudent
who
chooses
in
conformity
with
this
judgment
.



1781
Conscience
enables
one
to
assume
responsibility
for
the
acts
performed
.


If
man
commits
evil
,
the
just
judgment
of
conscience
can
remain
within
him
as
the
witness
to
the
universal
truth
of
the
good
,
at
the
same
time
as
the
evil
of
his
particular
choice
.


the
verdict
of
the
judgment
of
conscience
remains
a
pledge
of
hope
and
mercy
.


In
attesting
to
the
fault
committed
,
it
calls
to
mind
the
forgiveness
that
must
be
asked
,
the
good
that
must
still
be
practiced
,
and
the
virtue
that
must
be
constantly
cultivated
with
the
grace
of
God
:

We
shall
.


.


.


reassure
our
hearts
before
him
whenever
our
hearts
condemn
us
;
for
God
is
greater
than
our
hearts
,
and
he
knows
everything
.

⁵²

1782
Man
has
the
right
to
act
in
conscience
and
in
freedom
so
as
personally
to
make
moral
decisions
.


"He
must
not
be
forced
to
act
contrary
to
his
conscience
.


Nor
must
he
be
prevented
from
acting
according
to
his
conscience
,
especially
in
religious
matters
.
