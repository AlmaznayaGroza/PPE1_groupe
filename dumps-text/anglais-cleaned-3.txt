introduction

in this essay i explore adam smith s analysis of the origins of
conscience and general moral rules in the theory of moral sentiments

 i
argue that adam smith offers a distinction between moral conscience and
general moral rules that sidesteps the traditional distinction between
universal and relative moral standards leading to a fundamental
rethinking of the problem of the variability of moral opinion and the
demands of moral conscience and duty



moral conscience

like the thought of his mentor francis hutcheson and of his friend david
hume smith s moral theory is rooted in an analysis of the workings of
our moral sentiments

 in its barest form smith s argument is that we
judge others when we use our imaginations to put ourselves into their
situation and bring their case home to us

1 either we do or do not
sympathize with the sentiments and motives guiding the actions of the
person we are observing

 when the sentiments sparked in the spectator
are congruent with those found in the agent we approve of another s
actions or character as being appropriate

2 when they do not we condemn
them as inappropriate

 moral judgment thus arises from how we feel about
a particular situation that we as spectators are observing

 in order
to correct for any biases that might intrude into our moral judgment
from either our interests or our passions smith argues that we must
assume the socalled “impartial spectator” position for viewing others 
actions and motives

3 our senses of propriety and impropriety as well
as of merit and demerit follow from our observations and judgments as
spectators of ourselves and other people with the adoption of an
impartial spectator position to correct for any bias in our judgments



smith s notion of moral conscience follows directly from this general
approach

 he believes we cultivate a moral conscience by learning to
view ourselves our intentions and our actions from a position of
impartial spectatorship

 from this position we cultivate a concern with
praiseworthiness and blameworthiness not praise and blame

 being
virtuous and having a fully developed moral conscience for smith
represents the highest stage in the moral development of an individual



general rules and duty

early in the theory of moral sentiments smith appears to be confident in
our ability to form moral judgments

 a more cautious attitude emerges at
the beginning of chapter four of part iii of the theory of moral
sentiments

 the impartial spectator it seems is no longer enough to
help individuals make moral judgments in the real world

4 smith begins
the chapter by noting that the impartial spectator has its limitations
in the world of action

 we may try to view our own conduct from the
perspective of the impartial spectator both before and after we do
something

 but our passions and emotions can affect the way we examine
ourselves and often lead us to mistaken judgments in both circumstances


in general it is easier to resist this partiality after the fact when
our passions and emotions have subsided and no longer dominate our moral
perception of the world

 our ability to resist the partiality of the
passions before an action is more problematic

 we may want something so
badly that we are unable to make a good decision about what should be
done

 our passions want what they want and there may be nothing that we
can do about it

5

smith labels this partiality brought into moral judgment by the passions
and emotion “selfdeceit” and claims that it the “fatal weakness of
mankind” “the source of half the disorders of human life” tms 158


the solution that “nature” appears to have devised to the problem of
selfdeceit comes in the form of general rules concerning what is fit
and proper to do and what must be avoided

 the psychological source of
these general rules that we use to guide our judgments about ourselves
is surprising

 they do not arise from our observations of our own
behavior but from our observations of the behavior of others

 as smith
explains “our continual observations upon the conduct of others
insensibly lead us to form to ourselves certain general rules concerning
what is fit and proper either to be done or to be avoided” tms 159


the specific mechanism by which these rules are formed is considerably
different from the cultivation of conscience

 take the emergence of
negative rules or commands that order us not to do something

 we observe
another s behavior and disapprove of it

 we hear others express similar
sentiments and this confirms and reinforces our earlier judgment

 we
resolve never to be guilty of similar actions and exposed to similar
disapprobation

 “we thus naturally lay down to ourselves a general rule
that all such actions are to be avoided as tending to render us odious
contemptible or punishable the objects of all those sentiments for
which we have the greatest dread and aversion” tms 159

 in other
words general moral rules are formed out of our judgments of particular
experiences that we observe in conjunction with the judgments of others


a desire for praise or an aversion to blame not the moral conscience s
concern for praiseworthiness or aversion to blameworthiness compels us
to develop them

 after these general rules are formed and “universally
acknowledged and established by the concurring sentiments of mankind”
they are seen to be standards of judgment for evaluating other events in
the world tms 160



this view of the origins of general moral rules carries four important
consequences

 first it explains the tools available to individuals for
escaping the limitations of the moral sentiments when judging oneself


rather than trying to control or curtail one s passions and emotions an
individual can use general rules through “habitual reflection” as a way
to escape the misrepresentations of selflove and other passions

 the
rules are standards against which we can judge our actions before the
fact and decide if they are appropriate behavior or not

 second this
view helps account for the enormous variability in moral rules across
different cultures and historical periods

 there is no guarantee that
different societies will adopt the same general rules for overcoming the
limitations of moral judgment in real individuals

 third this account
helps explain how moral rules themselves can become the objects of moral
judgments

 individuals come to approve of general rules as being a good
thing for society to the point that they may believe that they have a
foundation independent of our moral sentiments

 history is replete with
examples of peoples claiming their rules were given to them by divine
authority

 our natural sense of duty may be reinforced by a mistaken
notion of the universality of the moral standards that have emerged in
the society in which we live

 finally this view explains how tensions
arise when the judgments of our moral conscience might be displaced or
at least come into conflict with the general rules that are established
in a particular society and to which we feel deep sentimental
attachments

 in smith s world there is no guarantee that the
conclusions of our sense of moral conscience will dovetail neatly into
our sense of duty



the sense of duty

smith s conclusions about the difference between the dictates of moral
conscience and our sense of duty to obey general rules are profound


virtuous individuals guided by moral conscience cultivate the feelings
that are appropriate to particular situations

 for example when
confronted with the benevolent behavior of another they feel gratitude
towards that person and act appropriately

 a person educated to one s
duty may never feel the appropriate sentiment of gratitude

 but they may
learn to act appropriately based on their regard for the rules of
gratitude established in their society

 “the motive of his actions”
smith explains “may be no other than a reverence for the established
rule of duty as serious and earnest desire of acting in every respect
according to the law of gratitude” tms 162

 a regard for the general
rules of society may be a secondbest option for human beings trying to
live together with one another

 acting from a sense of duty may not
point one to the most complete perfection of one s moral character

 but
it does give rise to a society where individuals can treat one another
with a “tolerable decency” and for most of one s life be able “to
avoid any considerable degree of blame” tms 163

 more to the point
our sense of duty may be more important than our sentiments for virtue


“without this sacred regard to general rules there is no man whose
conduct can be much depended upon” tms 163



the tension between conscience and duty

for smith humans are subject to multiple commands in ethics some
stemming from the dictates of conscience and others from duty

 when
should the principle of duty be the sole principle regulating our
conduct in the world and when should it concur with other motives such
as those provided by moral conscience

 conscience and duty introduce
tension into smith s understanding of moral judgement and action in the
theory of moral sentiments

 understanding that tension between the
demands of conscience and duty lies at the heart of the final chapter of
part vi



some moral judgements are guided primarily by moral conscience others
are guided by general rules and our sense of duty

 given the
characteristics of a particular passion individuals may face a
difficult task of balancing between the demands of conscience and of
duty

 for example regarding benevolent and social sentiments like love
our moral judgements and actions flow naturally from our benevolent
sentiments

 our sense of duty can be employed to watch over and moderate
excessive benevolence

 on the whole the benevolent side of our moral
character can be trusted to work appropriately

 with regard to
malevolent and unsocial passions such as resentment and anger however
moral judgement and action should proceed entirely from a sense of duty
the passions themselves being too dangerous to allow unlimited play as a
motive to our actions

 selfish passions are even more complicated

 our
ordinary private interest ought to flow from a regard to the general
rules not from the objects themselves

 but another quite different
conclusion is reached regarding the “extraordinary and important objects
of selfinterest” involving advancement and social recognition tms
173

 humans recognize that the actions of a prince in war a member of
parliament seeking reelection or a tradesman seeking a special job
must be grounded at least in part by the passion of ambition and not
just duty or conscience for successful advancement and social
recognition



a second issue that follows from the distinction between conscience and
duty involves the precision and exactness of the general moral rules
themselves

 some rules are clearer and more important to society than
others

 for example smith argues that the rules of such virtues as
prudence charity generosity gratitude and friendship “are in many
respects loose and inaccurate admit of many exceptions and require so
many modifications that it is scarce possible to regulate our conduct
entirely by a regard for them” tms 174

 in contrast the rules of
justice are accurate to the highest degree and admit of no exceptions

6
when we practice the former virtue sentiment should be allowed to
predominate rather than a specific regard for any particular rule

 “but
it is otherwise with regard to justice the man who in that refines the
least and adheres with the most obstinate stedfastness to the general
rules themselves is the most commendable and the most to be depended
on” tms 175



given its importance to human society it is not surprising that smith
sees other sentiments in our nature bolstering our sense of duty
particularly the religious sentiment

 even in its crudest form “during
the ignorance and darkness of pagan superstition” religion gave support
to the rules of morality

 people believed that the gods could be
appealed to in order to reward the good and punish the bad

 similarly
our natural sense of religion supports our natural sense of duty by
convincing us that the general rules of morality “are to be regarded as
the commands and laws of the deity promulgated by those vicegerents
which he has thus set up within us” tms 165

 there is a darker side
to religion s place in our moral life

 religion may complement the
teaching of our natural sentiments and reinforce the importance of our
sense of duty

 false religion may pervert our natural sentiments and
distort our notions of duty beyond recognition tms 176



the linkage drawn by smith between the general rules of morality and
“the commands and laws of the deity” is one of the most confusing in the
theory of moral sentiments and remains prone to misinterpretation

 one
might easily argue that what smith means to say is that the conclusions
of conscience are the general laws of morality backed by our religious
sentiment

 from this interpretation conscience can easily be identified
as “vicegerents of god” that reward us for following the law and punish
us for breaking it

 if my reading of the sharp distinction between duty
and conscience is correct this reading is seriously mistaken

 as i
argue above our general rules of morality are generalizations based
upon our observations of our moral judgments in conjunction with those
of others

 they are not conclusions of our moral conscience

 conscience
deals with the problem of praiseworthiness duty centers upon the
problem of praise

 all people have the capacity for moral
generalization

 all people do not have a highly functioning moral sense
of conscience

 the “vicegerents of god” that smith is referring to are
not just the sentiments involved with conscience

 they encompass all our
moral faculties including our sense of propriety and impropriety our
sense of merit and demerit and our sense of duty



the significance of the distinction between conscience and duty in
smith s thought is revealed most clearly at the end of chapter v in part
iii

 smith emphasizes that while he wants to distinguish between duty
and conscience he does not want to say they are necessarily
antithetical to one another

 on the contrary for the most part they
complement one another

 he comments that “the general rules by which
external prosperity and adversity are commonly distributed in this life”
tend to encourage and promote virtue

 prudence is rewarded with success
in business

 humanity is rewarded in our private lives with love

 but
there are times when some of our natural sentiments fly in the face of
general rules by which society is governed

 smith explains

 the industrious knave cultivates the soil the indolent good man
 leaves it uncultivated

 who ought to reap the harvest

 who starve and
 who live in plenty

 the natural course of things decides in favour of
 the knave the natural sentiments of mankind in favour of the man of
 virtue tms 168



from the perspective of duty the rules governing marketplace activity
that is property rights and the like generally result in socially
beneficial outcomes

 the fact that wealth goes to the industrious knave
rather than the lazy or indolent good man is acceptable to our sense of
justice

 but from the perspective of our other sentiments that tell us
that goodness should be rewarded another conclusion is sometimes
reached

 the efforts made by societies to redirect the natural
distribution of wealth often reflect the conflicting demands that our
sentiments make up the world

 sometimes these demands are misconceived


as smith notes

 the natural course of things cannot be entirely controlled by the
 impotent endeavors of man the current is too rapid and too strong for
 him to stop it and though the rules of which direct it appear to have
 been established for the wisest and best purpose they sometimes
 produce effects which shock all his natural sentiments tms 168



there are natural limits to what we can do to impose the teaching of our
consciences upon the world

 but that does not mean that we must deny our
consciences out of hand

 indignation in the face of perceived unfairness
is a natural response of our conscience to the world at times

 we may
not always be able to construct the world in the way that we wish but
we do not have to like it at the deepest levels of our being

 in the
end humans live their lives trying to balance the conflicting moral
demands of duty and virtue as best they can

 smith uses the term sympathy in a number of different ways often
 quite loosely

 in one of his broadest definitions smith suggests
 that the term may be used “without much impropriety be made use of
 to denote our fellowfeeling with any passion whatever

” tms 10
 for the purposes in this paper sympathy will refer to our
 imaginative capacity to enter into the sentiments of others

 like sympathy the idea of the impartial spectator has sparked
 considerable controversy in the secondary literature

 interestingly
 in parts ii and iii smith uses the concept of the impartial
 spectator without adequately explaining what he means by it or all
 the circumstances under which individuals might use it

 elsewhere i
 have argued that the idea of the impartial spectator is not any one
 particular position for viewing and judging the conduct of another


 it is not the unique position of an ideal spectator

 there may be a
 variety of impartial spectator positions for viewing others equally
 “impartial” but characterized by different capacities for moral
 judgment or even different amounts of information available to the
 spectator for making a moral judgment

 see harpham 2001 2004
 2010

 spectator see griswold 1999 otteson 2002 montes 2004 and

 “in order to pervert the rectitude of our own judgments concerning
 the propriety of our own conduct it is not always necessary that
 the real and impartial spectator should be at a great distance

 when
 he is at hand when he is present the violence and injustice of our
 own selfish passions are sometimes sufficient to induce the man
 within the breast to make a report very different from what the real
 circumstances of the case are capable of authorizing” tms 157

 this concern over the partiality of the passions and emotions lies
 at the heart of smith s rejection of francis hutcheson s theory of
 moral sense

 essentially smith s argument is that if we had a moral
 sense we would be able to judge our own actions and sentiments
 better than we are able to judge those of others

 this he believes
 is clearly not the case and one of the major reasons that general
 rules emerge in society as standards for measuring our own behavior
 against

 see tms 158

 this whole line of argument follows those developed by hume in book
 iii of the treatise

 echoing his friends smith writes “the rules
 of justice may be compared to the rules of grammar the rules of the
 other virtues to the rules which critics lay down for the attainment
 of what is sublime and elegant in composition

 the one are precise
 accurate an indispensable

 the other are loose vague and
 indeterminate and present us rather with a general idea of the
 perfection we ought to aim at than afford us any certain and
 infallible directions for acquiring it” tms 17677
