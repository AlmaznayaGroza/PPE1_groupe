conscience

i

 definition

conscience is a faculty of the mind that motivates us to act morally—or
at least according to our most deeply held values

  most say it is a
form of intuition and uses emotion although others have argued that it
should be shaped by reason

  it is a private experience and a form of
selfknowledge from one s conscience one can learn one s own values and
morals

  this is the root of the word from the latin conscientia
perhaps translatable as “togetherwithknowing” – to be together with
one s knowledge of morality



yet conscience has been thought by many to be informed by an objective
morality with divine transcendental or natural sources

  even in our
society where we ostensibly recognize the cultural and personal
relativity of morality conscience is granted a special status with
laws protecting the rights of doctors and others not to violate their
consciences

  so conscience is private subjective and culturally
relative but carries legal and political weight



there are many different ideas about conscience—religious
philosophical scientific legal and popular

 religious in most religions the morality that informs conscience
 does or should come from either god or an enlightened mind


 religions differ as to whether conscience is thought of mainly as a
 punisher e

g

 catholic or as a virtue to be cultivated e

g


 protestant buddhist


 philosophical many philosophers have written that a truly moral
 conscience requires the exercise of reason others have claimed that
 it is an intuition of objective moral truth

 premodern philosophers
 tended to believe in a natural and objective morality informing
 conscience—something like a truly moral instinct

  modern
 philosophers tend to recognize the cultural and individual
 relativity of morality and many present arguments based on
 scientific theories about mind evolution and society


 scientific such as theories in evolutionary psychology cognitive
 science and sociology


 legal our society seems to recognize “freedom of conscience” – that
 we should be free to obey our consciences – within limits


 considering that we don t have a clear or unified philosophy of
 conscience this raises legal political and social issues


 popular our everyday notions of conscience are philosophically
 interesting

 consider that conscience is a part of us opposing
 actions that we ourselves apparently already consider immoral but
 are in danger of doing anyway

  it seems a little paradoxical

  why
 do we need a conscience

 evolutionary theory most likely has the
 answer see “history” section

thought about conscience is so diverse and complex that a comprehensive
treatment is not possible

 this seems another paradox about conscience
we know it most intimately in ourselves but there is no consensus about
where it comes from or how much it should be respected



 

ii

 controversies about conscience

freedom of conscience is part of the united nations declaration of
human rights and the laws of many nations

  yet we have reason to
question the idea

  former nazi generals have told interviewers that
they acted with a clear conscience because their actions were
sanctioned by their leadership and society

  this would be consistent
with ideas about conscience as a social instinct but not necessarily an
altruistic one as darwin thought—perhaps conscience merely urges us to
conform with the mores of our society or beliefsystems



freedom of conscience is problematic because it s perfectly possible for
people s consciences to insist on actions that most of consider harmful
to other human beings—such as refusing to vaccinate their children



there are several traditional arguments in favor of freedom of
conscience

 the argument from hypocrisy or ineffectiveness most people agree
 that it is impossible to change a person s conscience from the
 outside therefore not granting freedom of conscience means
 requiring people to act contrary to their beliefs which seems
 wrong

 this was a reason to consider persecuting heretics
 ineffective from the medieval catholic point of view but aquinas
 and others then justified it for other reasons



however the argument from hypocrisy can be turned around if you can t
change a person s conscience then they still have freedom of
conscience even if you force them to behave in a certain way



 the argument from ignorance this is based on the recognition of
 relativism and subjectivism

 if our consciences don t give us
 objective moral guidance then you can t assume that yours is right
 and another s wrong therefore you don t have a right to deny them
 freedom of conscience


 the argument from legitimization john stuart mill argued that it is
 best for society if all people express their convictions freely for
 that will make it possible through comparison and debate to better
 approach truth



however none of these arguments completely addresses the conflicts
between freedom of conscience and public wellbeing

  some might say
that a doctor who refuses to perform a lifesaving operation out of
conscience should be charged with negligence or even manslaughter

 
while others might feel that performing the operation is murder

 the
precise limits of freedom of conscience are still an open debate with
profound consequences

 quotes about conscience

quotation 1

 “there comes a time when one must take a position that is neither
 safe nor politic nor popular but he must take it because conscience
 tells him it is right

”
 ― martin luther king jr

 a testament of hope the essential writings
 and speeches

this quote seems to represent the way most of us naturally think of
conscience—assuming that conscience is always right as if it s a direct
line to god or some other source of objective moral knowledge

  this
also implies that it is right to obey conscience even if opposes one s
social and legal environment

  one the one hand these could be
incorrect and dangerous assumptions on the other we could never change
injustice in our society like dr

 king without sometimes trusting
conscience over social norms



quotation 2

 “the infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to
 moralists

 that is why they invented hell

” ― bertrand russell
 skeptical essays

bertrand russel cuts to the heart of the problem with everyday notions
about the sacred truth of conscience

  people who were certain they knew
the moral truth and followed their conscience have included members of
the spanish inquisition the crusaders the nazis and most terrorists

 
such people did indeed invent hell



quotation 3

 “a clear conscience is the sure sign of a bad memory

” ― mark twain

this one speaks for itself



 

iv

 types of conscience

there are no types of conscience recognized by philosophers except
 critical conscience which means the application of critical reasoning
to ethical decisions

  many religious webpages list their own types of
conscience in light of their beliefs



conscience versus sociopathy

sociopaths are arguably individuals with no conscience

  they are also
defined as incapable of feeling empathy guilt fear or shame at
hurting others or violating any notion of morality

  interestingly
psychologists say that sociopaths understand morality and may even agree
with the moral values of their society

  they lack only the brain
connection between those values and the emotions that would prevent them
from hurting others enabling them to act without remorse

  most experts
claim that it is an incurable condition and neuroscientific research
shows concrete differences between normal and sociopathic brains

 
ironically then sociopaths seem to be evidence that a capacity for
conscience is innate in normal humans



 

v

 history of conscience

before cultural relativity and subjectivism came into vogue during the
20th century conscience was considered a source of objective moral
knowledge by almost everyone however in different senses in different
cultures

  in ancient hinduism buddhism and taoism knowledge of good
and evil was thought to be the natural longterm result of practicing
moral action and correct contemplation–in hindu thought through the
accumulation of good karma in buddhist and taoist thought through
purification of the heart and mind

 moral knowledge in these
beliefsystems was an aspect of enlightened mind—true knowledge of the
nature of self and reality

 ironically though each belief system had
different ideas about the content of this truth and morality

  in
hinduism it was primarily about selfsacrifice in buddhism compassion
and in taoism harmony with society and nature



judaism christianity and islam represented a very different
conception arguably

  all three religions are supposed to accept the
story of genesis which says that man s acquisition of the knowledge of
good and evil was a fall from grace original sin

   therefore
according to some interpretations following one s own intuitions is
more likely a source of sin than morality

  instead obedience to god s
law is thought the only true morality

  this would mean that true
conscience is knowledge of god s law whether that comes directly from
god or through obedience to scripture or clergy all these
possibilities—direct revelation scripture and obedience to
authorities–have been claimed as the source of moral knowledge in these
religions

  however in practice these religions also teach
purification of the mind to attain true conscience where eastern
religions teach that a pure mind allows the truth to emerge from within
one s own consciousness most versions of the abrahamic religions see a
pure mind as a prerequisite for receiving god s truth



greek and roman thought emphasized reason and knowledge in making moral
decisions a tradition beginning with aristotle s ideas about the
development of virtuous character and wisdom through reason and
practice

  this is also true of judaism known for its talmud a body of
writing devoted to interpreting scripture and applying it to ethical
issues through rational analysis and debate



despite the emphasis on blind obedience in christianity medieval
christian philosophers developed a theory of conscience with a strong
role for both intuition and reasoning

  st

 bonaventure and st

 aquinas
wrote of synderesis – a divine spark of moral knowledge – which could
only come to a mind which had been cultivated by reason and
contemplation to overcome the distortions and corruption of social
conditioning



in the 17th century spinoza similarly wrote that it was necessary to
practice and develop reason to transcend socially conditioned emotions
and perceptions

  however instead of positing a diving spark as the
source of moral truth spinoza said that if you view problems from the
perspective of eternity with a peaceful mind you will perceive moral
truth

   kant also regarded critical reasoning as an important element
of conscience believing that moral truth could be evaluated objectively
in light of his categorical imperative

   other 18th century
philosophers believed that conscience was purely intuitive excluding
reason but like kant many of them also believed in the objectivity of
the moral truth informing conscience



from the 18th century on increasing numbers of philosophers spoke
for pragmatic and relativistic ideas about conscience

  john locke wrote
about how a moral conscience might oppose the laws of the state and
thomas hobbes insisted that opinions based on conscience could easily be
wrong or in contradiction to other people s consciences

  so these and
other philosophers also advocated for a critical conscience –and some
skepticism about the dictates of conscience in general



in the 19th century darwin hypothesized that conscience evolved to
resolve conflicts between instincts such as between instincts for
selfpreservation and instincts to protect and cooperate with other
human beings



in the 20th century freud analyzed conscience as an effect of the
superego as we grow up natural instincts such as aggression and
sexual desire must be frequently frustrated and even punished by
parents and peers in order for us to develop into welladjusted members
of society

  this process creates the superego where we internalize
the beliefs implicit or explicit about right and wrong in our culture
and the superego causes us to feel guilt or anxiety when we violate
them



where darwin said that conscience evolved to resolve inner conflicts
other more recent evolutionary psychologists suggest that it evolved to
motivate altruistic behavior which is now thought to be evolutionarily
adaptive for social creatures



few today would claim that conscience is a source of objective morality
divine transcendental or otherwise since it is obvious that two
people s consciences or religions can dictate opposing moralities—such
as prochoice and prolife

   therefore philosophers today are more
concerned with exploring the consequences of this relativity of
conscience especially since people still seem to think of conscience as
objectively true sacred and inviolable

 which leads naturally to our
controversy – “freedom of conscience

”

 conscience in pop culture

example 1 pinocchio

une erreur s est produite



impossible d exécuter javascript



in this clip from the old disney pinocchio film jiminy cricket gives
the boy who would be human a lecture and song about conscience with the
message “always let your conscience be your guide

”  although that
message implies relying on intuitive conscience it s interesting that
the cricket first tries to explain something like critical conscience 
to pinocchio before giving up in confusion and falling back on a
traditional christian notion of conscience—resistance to temptation



example 2 emperor s new groove

une erreur s est produite



essayez de regarder cette vidéo sur www

youtube

com ou activez
javascript dans votre navigateur si ce n est pas déjà le cas



this scene from the emperor s new groove nicely dramatizes one of the
most popular conceptions of conscience in our society—the devil and
angel on your shoulders

  this colorful and compelling image seems to
imply that true morality consists of righteousness

 while following the
one that “rocks” is the evil one

  however instead of emphasizing good
vs evil they both just confuse the guy and he ends up dismissing them
both
