friedrich wilhelm nietzsche german philosopher philologist

in his genealogy of morals nietzsche dives into the origin of morals
starting with two forms of morality in the first essay the master
morality and the slave morality

 in order to understand the subject of
this essay that discusses the origin of guilt and bad conscience it is
vital to briefly demonstrate the first essay because the second essay is
followed by the latter

 in the first essay of the genealogy of morals
nietzsche demonstrates the origin of good and evil and that there are
two opposing moralities

 nietzsche names them the master morality and
the slave morality

 the master morality is associated with strength
confidence wealth and power whereas the slave morality is associated
with weak powerless poor and ugly



nietzsche argues that master morality does not hold grudges or deterred
by the actions of others — it holds its position and is focused on doing
the things that it wants and always believes in the possibility of
things

 on the contrary the slave morality is weak and therefore it
holds grudges against the strong

 the slave morality thinks that not
everything is possible because the strong always win the slave
morality therefore becomes jealous vengeful and seeks revenge from
the strong powered by ressentiment

 “all noble morality grows out of a
triumphant saying yes to itself slave morality says no on
principle to everything that is outside other nonself and this
 no is its creative deed

 this reversal of the evaluating glance — this
inevitable orientation to the outside instead of back onto itself — is a
feature of ressentiment

” the nietzsche reader on the genealogy of
morality a polemic p400

in the second essay of the genealogy of morals nietzsche argues that
humans and their nature are different from the rest of the animals

 it
is because of the ability to make promises that makes a human different
superior and organised from other species on earth

 the ability to
remember the promises made at a certain point under a specific
condition ought to be delivered at a particular time in future

 this
promise has different connotations within an individual a society and a
global realm

 the individual realm is concerned with direct interaction
between two individuals society and the world in itself

 it is because
the individual makes a promise at different levels

 for instance it
promises another individual to do a thing at a specific time in the
future

 whilst the individual also makes a promise to a society that
creates a relationship between the two as rousseau calls it social
contract 



in society an individual makes a promise not to break the law

 this
promise in itself is a social contract according to rousseau

 moreover
according to nietzsche breaking a promise is thus the origin of guilt 
where the promisebreaker forgets to uphold the promise that heshe
made

 “like a doorkeeper or guardian of mental order rest and
etiquette from which we can immediately see how there could be no
happiness cheerfulness hope pride immediacy without forgetfulness

”
the nietzsche reader on the genealogy of morality a polemic p408


however this forgetfulness can happen in two ways

 one which the
promisebreaker truly forgets and the second in which the
promisebreaker breaks hisher promise intentionally not because of
forgetting it but forgetting it intentionally

 the other end to
forgetfulness is the sense of ignorance which leads to more happiness as
the consciousness of the human forgot or yet to learn about the things
that cause unhappiness

 as they say the wiser the human becomes the
less happy heshe is



one of the reasons behind humans as a superior species is their free
will and the sovereign soul that makes decisions based on hisher
choice

 hence nietzsche argues that “this sovereign — how could he
remain ignorant of his superiority over everybody else who is not
permitted to make a promise or answer for himself how much trust fear
and respect he arouses — he merits all three

” the nietzsche reader
on the genealogy of morality a polemic p409

 the point in which a
person makes a promise is not only to another person but he should also
 answer for himself for instance i will do this or that

 the
terminology of i will means that i promise refers to an action of
the future

 however a human breaks too many promises of himself but
breaking a promise for another person will lead to a severe sense of
guilt

 the human s consciousness will push through to uphold the
promise

 “what will he call his dominant instinct assuming that he
needs a word for it

 no doubt about the answer this sovereign man calls
it his conscience

” the nietzsche reader on the genealogy of morality
a polemic p409



nietzsche describes the parties involved in the promise as the creditor
and debtor where the debtor repays the creditor in the form of
punishment in which pain could be extracted

 the exchange in which pain
as a form of debt is extracted from the debtor pays the creditor
according to nietzsche is pleasurable

 however nietzsche makes another
argument that concerns memory and has to do with the idea of
forgetfulness

 “only something which continues to hurt stays in the
memory — that is a proposition from the oldest and unfortunately the
longestlived psychology on earth

” the nietzsche reader on the
genealogy of morality a polemic p410

 often in punishing individuals
the psychology behind it is that it will stay in the memory of both the
observer and the subject — it shall prevent the individual from
committing a crime but also give a lesson for the rest of society that
they will be punished for their involvement in the act of crime


however this is not what nietzsche wants to bring into the modern
world

 rather he dives into the genealogy of justice and morality
practised in ancient times through the relationship of creditor and
debtor

 thus the debtor is the person who holds guilt or is guilty of
breaking the law or promise

 the debtor should repay the creditor in the
form that substitutes the debtor s benefits

 it can be extended to
different realms of society

 for instance the creditor can be a
religious king or a rich person and debtor based on the contract heshe
has must repay for what substitutes for the sin heshe has committed


this can be money food freedom or the debtor s body something the
debtor owns that when the debtor is unable to pay the creditor the
things that the debtor owns will substitute instead as a form of
payment

 however nietzsche argues in case when the debtor puts his body
as a substitute “in particular the creditor could inflict all kinds of
dishonour and torture on the body of the debtor for example cutting as
much flesh off as seemed appropriate for the debt

” the nietzsche
reader on the genealogy of morality a polemic p412

 this could
result in the death of the debtor



furthermore the relationship between creditor and debtor is the primary
but profound legal form to keep the order within a community

 thus it
evolved over time and changed to a system of justice in which criminals
are punished for the act that harmed the creditor

 this act could harm
the creditor and the community the debtor belongs to as a whole
therefore the punishment is necessary to prevent such acts in the
future from other community members

 in contrast nietzsche argues that
“it was out of anger over some wrong which had been suffered directed
at the perpetrator — but this anger was held in check and modified by
the idea that every injury has its equivalent which can be paid in
compensation if only through the pain of the person who injures” the
nietzsche reader on the genealogy of morality a polemic p412

 the
punishment will not prevent future wrong acts but it expresses that
every wrong act has a price and in a system of justice whether ancient
or modern — the price is measured according to the time age duration
and consequences of the wrong act of the doer

 the punishment marks in
the debtor s memory and through pain the memory lasts for quite a long
time

 however the memory of the pain may vanish or be forgotten at a
certain point in future but the other aspect that nietzsche touched
upon briefly is the humiliation of the debtor by the creditor

 the
psychology of humiliation extends it will make the debtor disappear
from the public eyes after receiving the punishment in the public arena


for example the extrajudicial beating denigrating and shaving the
heads of thieves in public spaces by the taliban in afghanistan as seen
in the 21st century where they not only punish them but parade the
criminals on the streets

 these criminals however receive physical
punishment but the humiliation in the public spaces will have
exponential psychological consequences both for the public observers and
the criminals at the same time



the debtor s price in a developing country is higher than in a rich
country

 today the punishment of the debtor is crueler in poorer
communities around the world

 however it is profoundly connected with
the amount of pleasure the creditor receives from the punishment of the
debtor

 because some of the rich countries too participate in getting
pleasure from inflicting pain on the debtor “to make someone suffer —
a true feast something which as i mentioned rose in price the more it
contrasted with the rank and social position of the creditor

” the
nietzsche reader on the genealogy of morality a polemic p413


because the creditor feels threatened for his position he will hold the
law in his hand to extract as much pain from the debtor as his societal
position allows him to

 this extraction of pain is pleasurable for the
creditor it is not a direct pleasure but a pleasure of superiority a
pleasure in which the creditor feels powerful strong and in a position
of authority

 “through punishment of the debtor the creditor takes part
in the rights of the masters at last he too shares the elevated
feeling of despising and maltreating someone as an inferior 

” the
nietzsche reader on the genealogy of morality a polemic p413

 this
also becomes problematic as the creditor extends his credits to those
who will most probably be unable to repay the debts and it is
therefore the creditor will enjoy not the pleasure of punishing the
debtor but enjoy having authority and power

 moreover the extension of
the credits in which those who are unable to repay it will enable the
creditors to enjoy an authority position

 thus the notion of will to
power expands to a deeper discussion for another essay



furthermore the relationship between creditor and debtor has another
crucial element and it deals with justice which is only implemented
by the strong or the creditor

 justice is a term linked with strength
power and authority what is just and what is not can only be determined
by the strong — only the strong dictates justice

 “justice at this first
level is the goodwill between those who are roughly equal to come to
terms with each other

” the nietzsche reader on the genealogy of
morality a polemic p414 nietzsche further takes the discussion of
justice to a system that emerges in greater human civilisation with
greater populations

 a system of justice is called the court where
before anything ruling on the punishment of the debtor the court is the
place where the debtor is found guilty of not repaying the creditor or
the creditor who is strong enough can show mercy and forgives the
debtor



“as a community grows in power it ceases to take the offence of the
individual quite so seriously because these do not seem to be as
dangerous and destabilising for the survival of the whole as they did
earlier the wrongdoer is no longer deprived of peace and cast out
nor can the general public vent their anger on him with the same lack of
constraint — instead the wrongdoer is carefully shielded by the
community from this anger especially from that of the immediate injured
party and given protection

” the nietzsche reader on the genealogy of
morality a polemic p415

in another part nietzsche argues that “the creditor always becomes more
humane as his wealth increases

” the nietzsche reader on the genealogy
of morality a polemic p416 with the increase of wealth the creditor
realises that the time spent on the punishment of the weak or the debtor
is merely a waste of time — a time so precious that it may bring more
wealth

 thus the creditor often suffices with minimum punishment
without the intention of pleasure or a sense of mastery but to keep the
debtor in check

 for instance the death penalty does exist in most
authoritarian regimes the execution of the political opposition that
damages the regime — making it an excuse to execute any political
opposition

 on the other hand many other countries give the death
penalty only to sporadic and exceptional cases as a form of justice for
the victim and justice for the perpetrator s guilt

 however there are
other exceptional cases in which the victim forgives the debtor and
reduces the amount of suffering that debtor may face

 one can also argue
that punishment will undo the wrong act committed by the debtor

 “the
selfsublimation of justice we know what a nice name it gives itself —
mercy it remains of course the prerogative of the most powerful man
better still his way of being beyond the law

” the nietzsche reader
on the genealogy of morality a polemic p416

on the contrary most people may be confused with the forms of justice
being applied in different realms of society

 as discussed in the first
essay of the genealogy of morals by nietzsche that the revolt of the
slave morality against the strong is out of resentment and jealousy

 the
slave morality is vengeful yet it is not strong physically therefore
the slave morality uses religion as a weapon of fear to control and take
revenge from the strong

 this will to power of the slave morality is out
of resentment and envy

 hence when the slave morality is in power its
justice is reactionary

 justice must not come from a resentful person


it is not justice in any form or shape but revenge

 the law order and
justice are only applied to the reactionary people not the active and
strong

 if the revenge of the reactionary takes the shape of justice it
is without a doubt that it breeds more reactionary people who will seek
revenge for the cruelty they face and call it justice 



in conclusion this essay is demonstrated in the second essay of the
genealogy of morals by nietzsche in which he argues that making a
promise is a skill that only humans possess this ability to remember
what is owed and when it is due

 the relationship that nietzsche talks
about is between creditor and debtor

 thus when the debtor breaks his
promise this broken promise is the origin of guilt for nietzsche and
in the process the debtor before making a promise must substitute
something in the case if he is unable to repay the debts to the creditor
in any form — which lead us to the notion of justice and how justice can
prevail between the creditor and debtor

 after all nietzsche s interest
in the profundity of the elements of justice guilt or bad conscience
describes how the justice system worked both historically and
psychologically

 for nietzsche it is not only important to think about
the origin of the abovediscussed subjects but also their correlation to
the modern world — the two opposing poles that nietzsche elaborates on
in his philosophy
