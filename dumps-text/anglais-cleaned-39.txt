By
“intellectual
conscience
,”
Nietzsche
means
the
idea
that
it
is
wrong
to
believe
something
unless
you
have
good
reason
to
think
that
the
belief
is
true
.


Someone
with
an
intellectual
conscience
will
form
and
endorse
beliefs
by
applying
the
best
epistemic
standards
known
to
him
or
her
.



Most
of
us
,
Nietzsche
thinks
,
lack
an
intellectual
conscience
:


[T
]he
great
majority
of
people
lacks
an
intellectual
conscience
.


[…
]
I
mean
:
the
great
majority
of
people
does
not
consider
it
contemptible
to
believe
this
or
that
and
to
live
accordingly
,
without
first
having
given
themselves
an
account
of
the
final
and
most
certain
reasons
pro
and
con
,
and
without
even
troubling
themselves
about
such
reasons
afterward…
.



(The
Gay
Science
§2
.


)

Exercising
the
intellectual
conscience
,
if
one
does
possess
it
,
doesn’t
necessarily
lead
to
certainty
;
on
the
contrary
.


The
more
you
subject
your
beliefs
to
scrutiny
,
the
less
certain
you
will
become
about
them
.


This
is
good
,
because
searching
for
the
truth
,
as
well
as
finding
it
,
is
good
.


Bernard
Reginster
puts
the
point
as
follows
:


[T
]he
seeker
after
knowledge
must
want
both
knowledge
and
uncertainty
or
ignorance
.


He
cannot
be
a
genuine
seeker
after
truth
unless
he
actually
wants
to
find
it
,
but
since
what
he
cares
about
is
the
search
after
truth
,
he
must
also
welcome
the
uncertainty
and
ignorance
that
supply
opportunities
for
it
.


(The
Affirmation
of
Life
:
Nietzsche
on
Overcoming
Nihilism
.


)

Although
intellectual
conscience
is
a
necessary
condition
,
it
is
not
,
Nietzsche
seems
to
think
,
a
sufficient
one
.


The
“last
idealists
of
knowledge
in
whom
alone
the
intellectual
conscience
dwells
today
,”
namely
the
scientists
,
have
rendered
Christian
belief
untenable
,
but
they
shrink
from
questioning
their
own
values
.


“These
are
by
no
means
free
spirits
:
for
they
still
believe
in
[the
value
of
]
truth
.

”
(On
the
Genealogy
of
Morals
,
III
§24
.


)

Properly
employed
by
an
authentic
free
spirit
,
intellectual
conscience
works
against
the
tendency
to
assimilate
novel
experiences
or
problems
to
already-familiar
explanations
and
evaluations
.


By
eroding
convictions
and
multiplying
possibilities
,
it
counteracts
the
disposition
to
simplify
and
unify
and
makes
it
less
likely
to
get
stuck
in
any
one
perspective
.



The
best
article
I
know
of
on
Nietzsche’s
concept
of
intellectual
conscience
is
Jeremy
Page’s
“Nietzsche
on
Honesty”
(2019
)
.
