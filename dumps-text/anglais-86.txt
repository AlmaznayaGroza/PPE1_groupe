   Internal conflict of society's oppressed
   Not to be confused with Dual consciousness.

   Double consciousness is the dual self-perception^[1] experienced by
   subordinated or colonized groups in an oppressive society. The term and
   the idea were first published in W. E. B. Du Bois's autoethnographic
   work, The Souls of Black Folk in 1903, in which he described the
   African American experience of double consciousness, including his
   own.^[2]

   Originally, double consciousness was specifically the psychological
   challenge African Americans experienced of "always looking at one's
   self through the eyes" of a racist white society and "measuring oneself
   by the means of a nation that looked back in contempt".^[2] The term
   also referred to Du Bois's experiences of reconciling his African
   heritage with an upbringing in a European-dominated society.^[3]

Origin

   [edit]
   [220px-The_Souls_of_Black_Folk_title_page.jpg] Title page of a 1903
   book in which Du Bois' essay about double-consciousness was
   re-published

   The term was introduced by Ralph Waldo Emerson in his 1842 essay "The
   Transcendentalist". Du Bois first used the term in an article titled
   "Strivings of the Negro People", published in the August 1897 issue of
   the Atlantic Monthly.^[4] It was later republished and slightly edited
   under the title "Of Our Spiritual Strivings" in his book, The Souls of
   Black Folk. Du Bois describes double consciousness as follows:

     It is a peculiar sensation, this double-consciousness, this sense of
     always looking at one's self through the eyes of others, of
     measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused
     contempt and pity. One ever feels his two-ness,—an American, a
     Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two
     warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps
     it from being torn asunder. The history of the American Negro is the
     history of this strife – this longing to attain self-conscious
     manhood, to merge his double self into a better and truer self. In
     this merging he wishes neither of the older selves to be lost. He
     does not wish to Africanize America, for America has too much to
     teach the world and Africa. He wouldn't bleach his Negro blood in a
     flood of white Americanism, for he knows that Negro blood has a
     message for the world. He simply wishes to make it possible for a
     man to be both a Negro and an American without being cursed and spit
     upon by his fellows, without having the doors of opportunity closed
     roughly in his face.^[2]

Modern conceptions

   [edit]

   The concept of double consciousness has been expanded on by many
   different scholars in the 20th and early 21st centuries. Commentators
   have examined how the concept can be expanded to other aspects of the
   African American experience, or for other marginalized groups who
   experience a similar forms of oppression.^[5]

Gilroy and the "Black Atlantic"

   [edit]

   Paul Gilroy applied theories of culture and race to the study and
   construction of African American intellectual history. He is known
   especially for marking a turning point in the study of the African
   diasporas.^[6] His book The Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double
   Consciousness (1993) introduces the "Black Atlantic" as a source for
   cultural construction.^[7] Gilroy pioneers a shift in contemporary
   black studies by arguing for a rejection of the notion of a homogeneous
   nation-state based nationality in favor of analyzing "the Atlantic as
   one single, complex unit of analysis in their discussions of the modern
   world and use it to produce an explicitly transnational and
   intercultural perspective".^[8] He based this on the Atlantic slave
   trade and marked it as the foundation for the diaspora. He recognized
   the significance of European and African transnational travel as a
   foundation for double consciousness. Gilroy used Du Bois's theory of
   double consciousness to suggest there exists an internal struggle to
   reconcile being both European and Black, which was his main focus in
   his book.^[7] He even characterized the Black Atlantic by the influence
   of slave trade "routes" on black identity. He aimed to unify black
   culture with the connection to the homeland as well as the cultural
   exchanges that occurred afterward. Gilroy's work became popular with
   the Black diaspora in Europe, and his theories became the foundation
   for several black power movements throughout the continent.^[9]

   Gilroy argues that occupying the space between these two dialectal
   subjectivities is "viewed as a provocative and even oppositional act of
   political insubordination".^[8] This means that for black people across
   diaspora, thinking of the duality in their identity as one is almost
   paradoxical, and conceptualizing and actualizing this is a move of
   symbolic resistance in modernity.^[citation needed]

Frantz Fanon

   [edit]

   Very similarly to Du Bois, Frantz Fanon touched upon the term of double
   consciousness in his life. In his first book, Black Skin, White Masks,
   where he expressed his hopelessness at being neither white nor black.
   Fanon identifies the double consciousness that African Americans face
   and its source; he claimed the cultural and social confusions of
   African Americans were caused by European culture.^[10] He gave
   examples of things that he has encountered that demonstrate the double
   consciousness. He talks about people who preach about completely
   conforming to being white and says that they are wrong. He also says
   that the people who believe that complete rejection of whites are also
   wrong.^[11]

   He then proceeds to talk about why black people adopt cultures that are
   so strange to him. He talks about how when a Black Caribbean leaves for
   Europe, they come back speaking a language different from their own. He
   also talks about how Africans, mostly the wealthiest, tend to have
   insecurities of not being European enough because they are African.
   This manifests in buying European furniture and buying European
   clothes.^[11]

   In addition to this he talks about the way white men talk to African
   Americans and how it contributes to this problem of double
   consciousness. He says that when a white man talks to an African
   American man he is changing his language to a way in which a
   stereotypical black man would talk, similarly to how one would talk to
   a child, with different language sophistication and slang. He says that
   this angers the African American because he feels as though he has been
   categorized and imprisoned into a box from which he cannot escape due
   to this judgement. He gives an example of a film where this stereotype
   is portrayed and then talks about how African Americans need to be
   educated to not follow the stereotypes displayed by white culture.^[12]

   Stephen Greenblatt also uses it to describe the peculiar quality of
   Shakespeare's consciousness in his biography of the bard, Will in the
   World (2004).^[13]

Triple consciousness

   [edit]

   In the 21st century, Du Bois's theory of double consciousness has been
   revisited to develop a more inclusive concept of triple consciousness.
   This triple consciousness may include another intersecting identity
   that impacts a person's social experiences. Additional identities that
   may affect the already present double consciousness experience might
   include ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, etc. For example, Juan
   Flores identified ethnicity as a potential aspect that influences
   double consciousness by speculating Afro-Latinos in the U.S.
   experienced an added layer of discrimination that combined skin color
   with ethnicity and nationality.^[14] Anna Julia Cooper similarly
   references the intersectionality of race and gender within her work A
   Voice from the South where she states: "Only the black woman can say
   'when and where I enter, in the quiet, undisputed dignity of my
   womanhood, without violence and without suing or special patronage,
   then and there the whole ... race enters with me".^[15] Finally,
   Jossianna Arroyo explains that triple consciousness brings "spaces,
   culture, and skin ... [to] re-contextualize blackness"^[16] in the case
   of black Puerto Ricans.

Experiences of women of color

   [edit]

   Just like any other thought in critical race analysis, double
   consciousness theory cannot be divorced from gender. This is where
   black feminists have introduced their concept of the triple
   consciousness.^[17] Black women not only have to see themselves through
   the lens of blackness and whiteness, but also through the lens of
   patriarchy. Whenever they are in black spaces, women still have to
   situate themselves in the context of patriarchy. Whenever they are in
   fem spaces, they must still situate themselves in the context of their
   blackness. Deborah Gray White writes, "African American women are
   confronted with an impossible task. If she is rescued from the myth of
   the negro, the myth of the woman traps her. If she escapes the myth of
   the women, the myth of the negro still ensnares her".^[18]

   Among the double burdens that feminists faced was fighting for women's
   rights as well as rights for people of color. Frances M. Beale wrote
   that the situation of black women was full of misconceptions and
   distortions of the truth. In her pamphlet Double Jeopardy: To Be Black
   and Female, she claimed that capitalism was the direct forebear of
   racism because the system was indirectly a way to destroy the humanity
   of black people.^[19]

   "In any society where men are not yet free, women are less free because
   we are further enslaved because we [African American women] are
   enslaved by our sex." Many African American women turned towards
   feminism in their fight against oppression because "there was an
   awareness that they were being treated as second-class citizens within
   the Civil Rights movement of the 60's." Due to this, many women felt
   that they were being asked to choose between "a Black movement that
   primarily served the interest of Black male patriarchs, and a women's
   movement which primarily served the interests of racist white women."

   The theory of double consciousness is also heavily present for female
   diasporic artists. These artists are faced with the task of remaining
   authentic to their roots while still branding themselves in a way to
   allow international and mainstream popularity. In the music industry,
   women of color are often stereotyped as being hyper-sexual and
   aggressive; which in some cases helps their branding, and in other
   cases, it hurts their branding and the identity they have attempted to
   create for themselves. Due to this, diasporic female artists are often
   forced to privilege certain self markers and conceal others depending
   on the situation; often making them feel as if they can never create
   one true identity for themselves but must rather change depending on
   the circumstances present.^[citation needed]

Black Power

   [edit]

   The first portion of Black Power: The Politics of Liberation, labeled
   "White Power", by Kwame Ture (formerly known as Stokely Carmichael) and
   Charles V. Hamilton, provides evidence backing up the ideology of
   double consciousness in regards to black people in the United States.
   The book opens up by defining racism as "the predication of decisions
   and policies on considerations of race for the purpose of subordinating
   a racial group and maintaining control over that group" (Hamilton &
   Ture, 3). Therefore, the subordinate group, black people, must think of
   themselves in terms of the oppressive population, white. Individual
   racism and institutional racism both contribute to double
   consciousness. On an individual level, double consciousness is
   practiced within every day interactions, and on an institutional level,
   it impacts how black people function throughout society. "Black People
   are legal citizens of the United States with, for the most part, the
   same legal rights as other citizens. Yet they stand as colonial
   subjects in relation to the white society."^[20] Therefore, while the
   Black population in the United States are essentially equal to whites
   under written law, there remain deeply rooted inequities between the
   races that reinforce double consciousness. Because these differences
   are not evident under the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights,
   they are an experience.

In the Afro-German paradigm

   [edit]

   Even though the framework of double consciousness can be applied to an
   African Diaspora and Transnationality, the nuances of racial dynamics
   differ from nation to nation. In Germany, for example, the political
   exigencies enforced by the Third Reich created a more nuanced
   situation. Tina Campt notes in Other Germans: Black Germans and the
   Politics of Race, Gender, and Memory in the Third Reich, the tension
   for Afro-Germans who "came of age during the totalitarian regime of the
   Third Reich ... was not necessarily experienced as one of absolute
   duality or 'twoness.' Rather, it was a contradictory and complexly
   textured form of identity".^[21] Due to the absence of a Black
   community in Germany, "most Afro-Germans did not have the option of
   choosing between a Black community or identity and a German
   identity".^[21] They were essentially forced to "occupy a position
   between a conception of German identity that excluded blackness and a
   conception of blackness that precluded any identification with
   Germanness".^[21] This means that for Black Germans during the Third
   Reich, the psychological dilemmas of "two-ness" did not necessarily map
   onto the double consciousness dynamic W. E. B. Du Bois first identified
   in 1897. For Black Germans in the early 20th century, there was no
   stable idea or community of blackness with which they could fully, or
   even partly, identify.
