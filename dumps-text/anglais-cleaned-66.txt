the word consciousness is used in a variety of ways that need to be
distinguished

 sometimes the word means merely any human mental activity
at all as when one talks about the “history of consciousness” and
sometimes it means merely being awake as in as the anesthetic wore off
the animal regained consciousness

 the most philosophically troublesome
usage concerns phenomena with which people seem to be “directly
acquainted”—as the british philosopher bertrand russell 1872–1970
described them—each in his own case

 each person seems to have direct
immediate knowledge of his own conscious sensations and of the contents
of his propositional attitudes—what he consciously thinks believes
desires hopes fears and so on

 in common philosophical parlance a
person is said to have “incorrigible” or uncorrectable access to his
own mental states

 for many people the existence of these conscious
states in their own case is more obvious and undeniable than anything
else in the world

 indeed the french mathematician and philosopher rené
descartes 1596–1650 regarded his immediate conscious thoughts as the
basis of all of the rest of his knowledge

 views that emphasize this
firstperson immediacy of conscious states have consequently come to be
called “cartesian

”

it turns out to be surprisingly difficult to say much about
consciousness that is not highly controversial

 initial efforts in the
19th century to approach psychology with the rigour of other
experimental sciences led researchers to engage in careful introspection
of their own mental states

 although there emerged some interesting
results regarding the relation of certain sensory states to external
stimulation—for example laws proposed by gustav theodor fechner
1801–87 that relate the apparent to the real amplitude of a sound—much
of the research dissolved into vagaries and complexities of experience
that varied greatly over different individuals and about which
interesting generalizations were not forthcoming



it is worth pausing over some of the difficulties of introspection and
the consequent pitfalls of thinking of conscious processes as the
central subject matter of psychology

 while it can seem natural to think
that all mental phenomena are accessible to consciousness close
attention to the full range of cases suggests otherwise

 the
austrianborn british philosopher ludwig wittgenstein 1889–1951 was
particularly adept at calling attention to the rich and subtle variety
of ordinary mental states and to how little they lend themselves to the
model of an introspectively observed object

 in a typical passage from
his later writings zettel §§484–504 he asked

 is it hairsplitting to say —joy enjoyment delight are not
 sensations

 —let us at least ask ourselves how much analogy is there
 between delight and what we call “sensation”

 “i feel great joy”
 —where

 —that sounds like nonsense

 and yet one does say “i feel a
 joyful agitation in my breast

” —but why is joy not localized

 is it
 because it is distributed over the whole body

 love is not a
 feeling

 love is put to the test pain not

 one does not say “that
 was not true pain or it would not have gone off so quickly

”

in a related vein the american linguist ray jackendoff proposed that
one is never directly conscious of abstract ideas such as goodness and
justice—they are not items in the stream of consciousness

 at best one
is aware of the perceptual qualities one might associate with such
ideas—for example an image of someone acting in a kindly way

 while it
can seem that there is something right in such suggestions it also
seems to be immensely difficult to determine exactly what the truth
might be on the basis of introspection alone



in the late 20th century the validity and reliability of introspection
were subject to much experimental study

 in an influential review of the
literature on “selfattribution” the american psychologists richard
nisbett and timothy wilson discussed a wide range of experiments that
showed that people are often demonstrably mistaken about their own
psychological processes

 for example in problemsolving tasks people
are often sensitive to crucial clues of which they are quite unaware
and they often provide patently confabulated accounts of the
problemsolving methods they actually employ

 nisbett and wilson
speculated that in many cases introspection may not involve privileged
access to one s own mental states but rather the imposition upon oneself
of popular theories about what mental states a person in one s situation
is likely to have

 this possibility should be considered seriously when
evaluating many of the traditional claims about the alleged
incorrigibility of people s access to their own minds



in any event it is important to note that not all mental phenomena are
conscious

 indeed the existence of unconscious mental states has been
recognized in the west since the time of the ancient greeks

 obvious
examples include the beliefs longrange plans and desires that a
person is not consciously thinking about at a particular time as well
as things that have “slipped one s mind” though they must in some way
still be there since one can be reminded of them

 plato thought that
the kinds of a priori reasoning typically used in mathematics and
geometry involve the “recollection” anamnesis of temporarily forgotten
thoughts from a previous life

 modern followers of sigmund freud
1856–1939 have argued that a great many ordinary parapraxes or
“freudian slips” are the result of deeply repressed unconscious
thoughts and desires

 and as noted above many experiments reveal
myriad ways in which people are unaware of and sometimes demonstrably
mistaken about the character of their mental processes which are
therefore unconscious at least at the time they occur



partly out of frustration with introspectionism psychologists during
the first half of the 20th century tended to ignore consciousness
entirely and instead study only “objective behaviour” see below radical
behaviourism

 in the last decades of the century psychologists began
to turn their attention once again to consciousness and introspection
but their methods differed radically from those of early
introspectionists in ways that can be understood against the background
of other issues



one might wonder what makes an unconscious mental process “mental” at
all

 if a person does not have immediate knowledge of it why is it not
merely part of the purely physical machinery of the brain

 why bring in
mentality at all

 accessibility to consciousness however is not the
only criterion for determining whether a given state or process is
mental

 one alternative criterion is that mental states and processes
enter into the rationality of the systems of which they are a part
