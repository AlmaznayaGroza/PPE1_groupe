When
documenting
your
patient’s
level
of
consciousness
,
you’ll
notice
you
have
a
LOT
of
options
to
choose
from
.


Your
patient
can
be
alert
,
confused
,
in
a
coma
and
anything
in
between
.


Knowing
the
difference
between
each
level
of
consciousness
will
help
you
chart
accurately
and
communicate
your
patient’s
condition
with
precision
.


The
different
levels
of
consciousness
are
:

-
Alert
:
awake
and
responsive
-
Confused
:
note
that
confusion
can
occur
anywhere
along
this
spectrum

and
is
not
always
present
prior
to
the
patient
becoming
somnolent
,

lethargic
,
etc…
It
is
possible
to
have
a
patient
who
is
somnolent
or

even
lethargic
and
still
oriented
.


-
Somnolent
:
sleepy
-
Lethargic
:
very
drowsy
,
falls
asleep
in
between
care
-
Obtunded
:
difficult
to
arouse
-
Stuporous
:
very
difficult
to
arouse
-
Unresponsive/Coma
:
unarousable

Describing
your
patient’s
LOC
correctly
is
especially
important
when
there
are
acute
changes
in
condition
.


For
example
,
I
had
a
patient
recently
who
was
stuporous
upon
arrival
to
the
ICU
,
but
quickly
became
unresponsive
,
requiring
immediate
intervention
in
order
to
keep
the
patient
safe
.


Had
I
not
known
how
to
describe
this
patient’s
level
of
consciousness
using
standardized
language
,
there
could
have
been
a
huge
miscommunication
between
me
and
the
MD
.


So
,
let’s
go
through
a
quick
example
using
an
entirely
fictitious
patient
.


Ready
?




[
]

In
report
you
learn
the
following
about
your
patient
:
56
year
old
female
with
CKD
stage
4
,
CHF
,
DM2
,
and
hyperlipidemia
.


BIBA
yesterday
for
SOB
,
currently
on
6L
oxygen
.


BP
110/68
,
HR
77
,
O2
sat
94%
,
afebrile
.


Urine
output
minimal
overnight
at
20
ml/hr
,
dark
and
concentrated
.


Chemistry
panel
shows
mild
hyperkalemia
,
elevated
BUN
and
Creatinine
,
mildly
anemic
with
Hbg
9
.

2
and
WBC
WDL
.



At
the
time
of
your
initial
assessment
at
0800
,
you
note
that
the
patient
opens
her
eyes
spontaneously
and
responds
to
questions
though
not
all
her
answers
make
sense
.


She
will
follow
simple
one-step
commands
,
but
when
you
ask
her
to
do
more
than
one
thing
at
a
time
,
she
does
not
always
follow
through
.


You
ask
your
patient
where
she
is
right
now
and
she
answers
“in
my
living
room
.

”
At
this
time
,
your
patient
is
ALERT
and
CONFUSED
.



At
0900
,
you
bring
in
your
patient’s
medications
.


She
wakes
easily
to
voice
but
yawns
a
few
times
and
states
she
just
wants
to
sleep
.


At
this
point
your
patient
is
SOMNOLENT
.



At
1000
, 
you
go
in
to
help
your
patient
get
repositioned
when
you
notice
she
opens
eyes
only
to
voice
or
stimulation
(not
spontaneously
)
.


She
follows
some
basic
commands
,
and
is
slow
to
respond
.


She
drifts
off
again
once
no
longer
stimulated
.


Your
patient
is
now
LETHARGIC
.



At
1200
,
your
patient
is
more
difficult
to
arouse
.


Her
responses
are
delayed
and
minimal
.


She
does
not
appear
to
fully
wake
when
stimulated
and
she
immediately
goes
back
to
sleep
when
not
stimulated
.


When
she
does
answer
questions
,
she
mumbles
and
is
clearly
confused
.


At
this
time
she
is
OBTUNDED
.



By
1300
,
your
patient
can
only
be
aroused
by
vigorous
and
repeated
stimulation
.


When
the
stimulation
stops
she
immediately
lapses
back
into
her
unresponsive
state
.


The
only
vocalizations
she
makes
are
moans
.


She
is
now
in
a
STUPOR
.



At
1400
,
your
patient
is
unarousable
to
any
stimulation
,
even
vigorous
and
painful
stimuli
.


At
this
point
she
is
UNRESPONSIVE
or
COMATOSE
.



Of
course
,
you’ve
been
updating
the
MD
on
your
patient’s
changes
in
LOC
all
morning
,
and
you
have
both
ensured
that
the
appropriate
interventions
have
been
instituted
.


In
a
case
with
patient
with
renal
disease
,
you
will
often
see
them
have
decreasing
levels
of
consciousness
as
their
pH
drops
secondary
to
their
metabolic
acidosis
.


With
a
patient
like
this
,
you
might
anticipate
the
MD
ordering
an
ABG
at
some
point…don’t
be
surprised
if
it
comes
back
acidotic
.


Typically
what
happens
is
the
patient
will
receive
dialysis
and
as
things
start
to
come
back
into
balance
the
patient
becomes
more
alert
(assuming
they
don’t
have
any
other
underlying
physiologic
derangements
such
as
sepsis
.


)

The
other
common
situation
this
occurs
in
is
COPD
exacerbation
.


The
pH
will
decrease
as
the
CO2
increases
.


As
the
CO2
rises
,
the
patient
becomes
more
and
more
comatose…usually
we
can
pull
the
patient
out
of
it
with
BIPAP
,
but
in
extreme
cases
they
may
be
intubated
.


You’ll
see
this
over
and
over
and
over
again…especially
if
you
work
in
a
medical
ICU
or
telemetry
unit
.



This
whole
topic
of
consciousness
is
so
incredibly
interesting
,
especially
as
it
relates
to
anesthesia
.


If
you’re
interested
in
getting
your
CRNA
someday
,
you
might
find
this
article
fascinating…I
know
I
certainly
did
!


Enjoy
!
