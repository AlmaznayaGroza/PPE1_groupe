consciousness
,
a
psychological
condition
defined
by
the
English
philosopher
John
Locke
as
“the
perception
of
what
passes
in
a
man’s
own
mind
.

”

(Read

Noah
Harari’s
Britannica
essay
on
“Nonconscious
Man
.

”)

Early
views

In
the
early
19th
century
the
concept
was
variously
considered
.


Some
philosophers
regarded
it
as
a
kind
of
substance
,
or
“mental
stuff
,”
quite
different
from
the
material
substance
of
the
physical
world
.


Others
thought
of
it
as
an
attribute
characterized
by
sensation
and
voluntary
movement
,
which
separated
animals
and
men
from
lower
forms
of
life
and
also
described
the
difference
between
the
normal
waking
state
of
animals
and
men
and
their
condition
when
asleep
,
in
a
coma
,
or
under
anesthesia
(the
latter
condition
was
described
as
unconsciousness)
.


Other
descriptions
included
an
analysis
of
consciousness
as
a
form
of
relationship
or
act
of
the
mind
toward
objects
in
nature
,
and
a
view
that
consciousness
was
a
continuous
field
or
stream
of
essentially
mental
“sense
data
,”
roughly
similar
to
the
“ideas”
of
earlier
empirical
philosophers
.

Altered
consciousness

The
method
employed
by
most
early
writers
in
observing
consciousness
was
introspection—looking
within
one’s
own
mind
to
discover
the
laws
of
its
operation
.


The
limitations
of
the
method
became
apparent
when
it
was
found
that
because
of
differing
preconceptions
,
trained
observers
in
the
laboratory
often
could
not
agree
on
fundamental
observations
.



The
behaviourist
view

The
failure
of
introspection
to
reveal
consistent
laws
led
to
the
rejection
of
all
mental
states
as
proper
subjects
of
scientific
study
.


In
behaviourist
psychology
,
derived
primarily
from
work
of
the
American
psychologist
John
B
.


Watson
in
the
early
1900s
,
the
concept
of
consciousness
was
irrelevant
to
the
objective
investigation
of
human
behaviour
and
was
doctrinally
ignored
in
research
.


Neobehaviourists
,
however
,
adopted
a
more
liberal
posture
toward
mentalistic
states
such
as
consciousness
.



Neurophysiological
mechanisms

That
consciousness
depends
on
the
function
of
the
brain
has
been
known
from
ancient
times
.


Although
detailed
understanding
of
the
neural
mechanisms
of
consciousness
has
not
been
achieved
,
correlations
between
states
of
consciousness
and
functions
of
the
brain
are
possible
.


Levels
of
consciousness
in
terms
of
levels
of
alertness
or
responsiveness
are
correlated
with
patterns
of
electrical
activity
of
the
brain
(brain
waves)
recorded
by
an
electroencephalograph
.


During
wide-awake
consciousness
the
pattern
of
brain
waves
consists
of
rapid
irregular
waves
of
low
amplitude
or
voltage
.


In
contrast
,
during
sleep
,
when
consciousness
can
be
said
to
be
minimal
,
the
brain
waves
are
much
slower
and
of
greater
amplitude
,
often
coming
in
periodic
bursts
of
slow
waxing
and
waning
amplitude
.



Both
behavioral
levels
of
consciousness
and
the
correlated
patterns
of
electrical
activity
are
related
to
the
function
of
a
part
of
the
brainstem
called
the
reticular
formation
.


Electrical
stimulation
of
the
ascending
reticular
systems
arouses
a
sleeping
cat
to
alert
consciousness
and
simultaneously
activates
its
brain
waves
to
the
waking
pattern
.

It
was
once
supposed
that
the
neurophysiological
mechanisms
subserving
consciousness
and
the
higher
mental
processes
must
reside
in
the
cortex
.


It
is
more
likely
,
however
,
that
the
cortex
serves
the
more
specialized
functions
of
integrating
patterns
of
sensory
experience
and
organizing
motor
patterns
and
that
the
ascending
reticular
system
represents
the
neural
structures
most
critically
related
to
consciousness
.


The
brainstem
reticular
formation
should
not
,
however
,
be
called
the
seat
of
consciousness
.


It
represents
an
integrative
focus
,
functioning
through
its
widespread
interconnections
with
the
cortex
and
other
regions
of
the
brain
.
