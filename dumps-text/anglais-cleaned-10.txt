eating with a conscience

choose a cropchoosing organic food to protect health and the environment

our food choices have a direct effect on the health of our environment
and those who grow and harvest what we eat

  that s why food labeled
organic is the right choice

 in addition to serious health questions
linked to actual residues of toxic pesticides on the food we eat our
food buying decisions support or reject hazardous agricultural
practices protection of farmworkers and farm families and stewardship
of the earth



the organic choice is clear

it is important to eat organic food—nurtured in a system of food
production handling and certification that rejects hazardous synthetic
chemicals

 usda organic certification is the only system of food
labeling that is subject to independent public review and oversight
assuring consumers that toxic synthetic pesticides used in conventional
agriculture are replaced by management practices focused on soil
biology biodiversity and plant health

 this eliminates commonly used
toxic chemicals in the production and processing of food that is not
labeled organicpesticides that contaminate our water and air hurt
biodiversity harm farmworkers and kill bees birds fish and other
wildlife



food choices based only on pesticide residues fall short

to help explain the urgent need for a major shift to organic food
consumption beyond pesticides has begun the eating with a conscience
database which evaluates the impacts on the environment and farmworkers
of the toxic chemicals allowed for use on major food crops grown
domestically and internationally

 we have started with those foods that
have been identified widely in the media as “clean

” while the clean 15
and dirty dozen lists generated by environmental working group is
helpful in alerting consumers to hazardous residues on food food
residues are only part of the story

 it turns out that those very same
“clean” food commodities may be grown with hazardous pesticides that get
into waterways and groundwater contaminate nearby communities poison
farmworkers and kill wildlife while not all showing up at detectable
levels on our food



choosing organic for you the environment and workers

eating with a conscience looks at the toxic chemicals that are allowed
in the production of the food we eat and the environmental and public
health effects resulting from their use



choose a fruit or vegetable
