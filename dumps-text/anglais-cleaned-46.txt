close 

consciousness is the individual awareness of your unique thoughts
memories feelings sensations and environments

 essentially your
consciousness is your awareness of yourself and the world around you



this awareness is subjective and unique to you

 if you can describe
something you are experiencing in words then it is part of your
consciousness



your conscious experiences are constantly shifting and changing

 for
example in one moment you may be focused on reading this article

 your
consciousness may then shift to the memory of a conversation you had
earlier with a coworker

 next you might notice how uncomfortable your
chair is or maybe you are mentally planning dinner



this evershifting stream of thoughts can change dramatically from one
moment to the next but your experience of it seems smooth and
effortless



 states of consciousness 

the various states of consciousness include

 dreams
 hallucinations
 hypnosis
 meditation
 sleep
 states induced by psychoactive drugs

the two normal states of awareness are consciousness and
unconsciousness

 higher states of consciousness are often associated
with spiritual or mystical experiences

 it involves an elevated state of
awareness where people are able to gain a greater sense of themselves
their role and the world

 examples of this include transcendence
meditation mindfulness a runner s high lucid dreaming and flow
states

 

altered levels of consciousness also can occur which may be caused by
medical or mental conditions that impair or change awareness

  altered
types of consciousness include

 coma
 confusion
 delirium
 disorientation
 lethargy
 stupor

doctors and healthcare professionals use various assessments to measure
and assess levels of consciousness

 they use scores on these assessments
to guide diagnosis and treatment decisions



what are the 5 levels of consciousness



conscious everything you are aware of

preconscious information you are not currently aware of that you can
pull into awareness if needed

unconscious memories that are outside of awareness and inaccessible

nonconscious automatically bodily functions that occur without
awareness and sensation

subconscious information that is out of consciousness and not
immediately available to consciousness

what is the unconscious mind



 functions of consciousness 

consciousness has several biological and social purposes

 for example
it allows us to process information choose our actions set priorities
learn and adapt to new information make decisions and more



consciousness is an essential state in philosophy spirituality and
religion

 all of these require selfawareness which is impossible
without consciousness



 changes in consciousness 

understanding different levels of consciousness can help healthcare
professionals spot signs that someone might be experiencing a problem


some of these changes occur naturally others are the result of factors
such as drugs or brain damage

 changes to consciousness also can cause
changes to perception thinking understanding and interpretations of
the world



changes in consciousness can sometimes be a sign of medical conditions
or they may even be a sign of an immediate medical emergency



for example sudden changes in consciousness might be a sign of

 aneurysm
 brain infections
 brain tumor or injury
 dementia or alzheimer s disease
 drug use
 epilepsy
 heart disease
 heatstroke
 lack of oxygen to the brain
 low blood sugar
 poisoning
 shock
 stroke

when to seek help

if you thinking you are experiencing changes in consciousness talk to
your doctor

 sudden changes may be a sign of a medical emergency that
requires immediate attention such as a stroke or hemorrhage

 

talking to your doctor right away can ensure that you get immediate
treatment before problems get worse



 history of consciousness 

for thousands of years the study of human consciousness was largely the
work of philosophers

 the french philosopher rene descartes introduced
the concept of mindbody dualism or the idea that while the mind and
body are separate they do interact



once psychology was established as a discipline separate from philosophy
and biology the study of the conscious experience became one of the
first topics studied by early psychologists



structuralists used a process known as introspection to analyze and
report conscious sensations thoughts and experiences

 trained
observers would carefully inspect the contents of their own minds


obviously this was a very subjective process but it helped inspire
further research on the scientific study of consciousness



the american psychologist william james compared consciousness to a
stream—unbroken and continuous despite constant shifts and changes


psychoanalyst sigmund freud focused on understanding the importance of
the unconscious and conscious mind



while the focus of much of the research in psychology shifted to purely
observable behaviors during the first half of the 20th century research
on human consciousness has grown tremendously since the 1950s



 theories of consciousness 

one of the problems with the study of consciousness is the lack of a
universally accepted operational definition

 descartes proposed the idea
of cogito ergo sum i think therefore i am which suggested that the
very act of thinking demonstrates the reality of one s existence and
consciousness



today consciousness is generally defined as an awareness of yourself
and the world

 however there are still debates about the different
aspects of this awareness



research on consciousness has focused on understanding the neuroscience
behind our conscious experiences

 scientists have even utilized
brainscanning technology to seek out specific neurons that might be
linked to different conscious events

 modern researchers have proposed
two major theories of consciousness integrated information theory and
global workspace theory



 integrated information theory 

this approach looks at consciousness by learning more about the physical
processes that underlie our conscious experiences

 the theory attempts
to create a measure of the integrated information that forms
consciousness

 the quality of an organism s consciousness is represented
by the level of integration



this theory tends to focus on whether something is conscious and to what
degree it is conscious



 global workspace theory 

this theory suggests that we have a memory bank from which the brain
draws information to form the experience of conscious awareness

﻿﻿ while
integrated information theory focuses more on identifying whether an
organism is conscious the global workspace theory offers a much broader
approach to understanding how consciousness works



the different states of consciousness

 summary 

while consciousness has intrigued philosophers and scientists for
thousands of years experts clearly have a long way to go in our
understanding of the concept

 researchers continue to explore the
different bases of consciousness including the physical social
cultural and psychological influences that contribute to our conscious
awareness
