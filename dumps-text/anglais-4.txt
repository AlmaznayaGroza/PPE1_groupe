How does the conscious differ from the conscience? Being conscious is
the state of being awake and alert. Conscience, on the other hand,
refers to an awareness of whether actions are right or wrong.

These two terms are sometimes confused in common everyday usage because
they sound quite similar. However, as you can see, they mean very
different things within the field of psychology.

At a Glance

While the two terms are often confused, the conscious and the conscience
refer to very different things. Your conscious allows you to be aware of
your place in the world, while your conscience allows you to behave in
this world in morally and socially acceptable ways. As described below,
being conscious refers to your awareness of yourself and the world
around you. Your conscience is your ability to distinguish between what
is right and what is wrong.

 What Does Conscience Mean? 

Your conscience is the part of your personality that helps you determine
right and wrong and keeps you from acting upon your most basic urges and
desires.

Your conscience is what makes you feel guilty when you do something bad
and good when you do something kind.

It is the moral basis that helps guide prosocial behavior, or behavior
that helps others, and leads you to behave in socially acceptable and
even altruistic ways.

In Freudian theory, the conscience is part of the superego that contains
information about what is viewed as bad or negative by your parents and
by society—all the values you learned and absorbed during your
upbringing. The conscience emerges over time as you take in information
about what is considered right and wrong by your caregivers, your peers,
and the culture in which you live.

One way a child’s sense of morality might develop is through their
caregiver's rules. For example, if a parent sets a rule, a child could
learn a sense of right and wrong regarding that topic. Studies have also
examined other factors that may affect the way conscience develops,
including the nature of the parent-child relationship, style of parental
discipline, and the child's temperament—but more research is needed.

 What Does Conscious Mean? 

Your conscious is your awareness of yourself and the world around you.
In the most general terms, it means being awake and aware. Some experts
suggest that you are considered conscious of something if you are able
to put it into words.

Not only can you be conscious—as in awake—but you can also be
conscious—as in aware—of your thoughts and feelings.

 The Conscious Mind 

In psychology, the conscious mind includes everything inside your
awareness, including:

-   Fantasies
-   Feelings
-   Memories
-   Perceptions
-   Thoughts

A metaphor that is sometimes used to explain the concept of the
conscious mind within psychoanalytic theory is likening the mind to an
iceberg. The part of the iceberg that can be seen above the surface of
the water represents conscious awareness. It is what we are aware of and
can describe and articulate clearly.

The largest part of the iceberg actually lies below the surface of the
water. This represents the unconscious mind and includes all the
thoughts, memories, and urges that are outside of our conscious
awareness. This metaphor is frequently attributed to Sigmund Freud, but
according to the American Psychological Association (APA), he never
wrote about it.

 What Is Consciousness? 

Your consciousness refers to your conscious experiences, your individual
awareness of your own internal thoughts, feelings, memories, and
sensations.

Consciousness is often thought of as a stream, constantly shifting
according to the ebb and flow of your thoughts and experiences of the
world around you.

"Consciousness is generally defined as awareness of your thoughts,
actions, feelings, sensations, perceptions, and other mental processes,"
explain psychologists Douglass A. Bernstein, Louis A. Penner, and Edward
Roy.

In other words, they say, this suggests that consciousness isn't just
one mental process but rather a part of many. "For example, memories can
be conscious, but consciousness is not just memory. Perceptions can be
conscious, but consciousness is not just perception."

The conscious and consciousness can be difficult to pin down. As
psychologist and philosopher William James once explained, "Its meaning
we know so long as no one asks us to define it."

Consciousness in Psychology

 Breaking Down the Differences 

Conscience

-   Noun

-   Moral awareness

-   Acts as a moral compass

Conscious

-   Adjective

-   Mental awareness

-   Means a person is awake and responsive

To further explain their differences, here are examples of how the terms
conscience and conscious could be used in a sentence.

 Conscience 

They had a guilty conscience because they cheated on the test.

The term conscience here describes this person's sense of what is right
and wrong and the subsequent feeling of guilt they have over cheating on
the test.

 Conscious 

They were worried they might faint at the sight of the blood, but they
remained conscious.

The person was afraid they would lose consciousness by fainting when
they saw blood. However, they didn't faint and stayed awake and aware of
their surroundings.

They were conscious of the fact that everyone was staring at them.

The term conscious here describes the awareness of the person who
noticed that everyone was looking at them.

Tip:

When thinking about these two concepts, just remember that conscious
means to be awake and aware while conscience refers to your inner sense
of right and wrong.

 Common Uses 

-   Guilty conscience: Indicates that someone feels guilty about their
    actions
-   Clear conscience: Suggests that people 
-   Conscious of your words: Suggests that you are aware of the effect
    your words may have and thus choose them with caution.
-   Cost-conscious: Indicates that a person is concerned about prices
    and makes choices to conserve money and stay within a budget
-   The patient was conscious: Indicates that a person was awake and
    aware

It's definitely easy to confuse the terms conscious and conscience,
particularly when you hear the words spoken out loud. However, with the
help of some context clues and some attention to their spelling
differences, you should have no problem telling them apart when you come
across them.
