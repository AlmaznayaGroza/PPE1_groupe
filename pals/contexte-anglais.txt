reading
the
philosophical
and
historical
literature
on
conscience
the
first
thing
one
would
notice
is
the
variety
of
meanings
and
psychological
and
ethical
assessments
of
the
concept
different
philosophical
religious
and
common
sense
approaches
to
conscience
have
emphasized
different
aspects
of
the
following
broad
characterization
through
our
individual
conscience
we
become
aware
of
our
deeply
held
moral
principles
we
are
motivated
to
act
upon
them
and
we
assess
our
character
our
behavior
and
ultimately
our
self
against
those
principles
the
resulting
more
specific
understandings
of
conscience
will
be
presented
in
the
sections
below
on
any
of
these
accounts
conscience
is
defined
by
its
inward
looking
and
subjective
character
in
the
following
sense
conscience
is
always
knowledge
of
ourselves
or
awareness
of
moral
principles
we
have
committed
to
or
assessment
of
ourselves
or
motivation
to
act
that
comes
from
within
us
as
opposed
to
external
impositions
this
inward
looking
and
subjective
character
of
conscience
is
also
reflected
in
the
etymological
relation
between
the
notion
of
“
conscience
”
and
that
of
consciousness
only
after
the
17th
century
did
“
consciousness
”
start
to
be
used
with
a
distinct
meaning
referring
to
the
psychological
and
phenomenal
dimension
of
the
mind
shift
see
jorgensen
2014
the
term
“
conscience
”
translates
the
latin
“
conscientia
”
which
refers
to
sharing
“
knowledge
”
scientia
“
with
”
con
and
which
in
turns
translates
the
equivalent
greek
term
suneidenai
see
pierce
1955
and
whom
that
knowledge
is
shared
with
however
the
concept
has
traditionally
been
used
to
refer
to
moral
knowledge
we
talk
indifferently
of
conscience
and
moral
conscience
that
is
shared
with
oneself
this
reference
to
the
self
does
not
rule
out
that
the
source
of
the
morality
in
question
be
external
to
the
self
for
example
it
might
or
of
one
s
upbringing
as
in
the
freudian
theory
of
the
superego
reference
to
the
self
indicates
that
from
a
psychological
point
of
view
conscience
involves
introspection
awareness
of
one
s
behavior
and
selfassessment
as
we
shall
see
although
these
aspects
often
overlap
they
are
psychologically
and
conceptually
distinct
functions
ideal
observer
for
instance
a
god
an
imagined
moral
model
an
impartial
spectator
unfortunately
debates
in
which
appeals
to
conscience
are
often
made
—
for
example
the
debate
about
conscientious
objection
in
health
care
—
are
often
characterized
by
a
lack
of
clarity
as
to
what
it
exactly
is
that
we
are
talking
about
when
we
talk
about
conscience
and
therefore
about
what
exactly
people
are
claiming
when
they
put
forward
a
“
conscientious
objection
”
to
for
example
abortion
in
what
sense
does
abortion
violate
the
conscience
of
a
committed
catholic
doctor
and
is
conscience
amenable
to
reason
and
public
discussion
or
are
appeals
to
conscience
ultimately
based
on
intuitions
and
private
morality
in
what
sense
is
a
conscientious
choice
different
from
a
mere
moral
preference
the
notion
of
conscience
is
in
need
of
conceptual
clarification
this
entry
will
expound
the
main
features
of
the
notion
of
conscience
as
it
is
used
in
philosophical
discussion
religious
teaching
and
in
common
language
alike
the
perspective
adopted
here
will
be
theoretical
rather
examples
are
drawn
from
christian
source
the
entry
is
structured
around
four
possible
but
not
mutually
exclusive
ways
of
conceptualizing
conscience
these
will
be
preceded
by
an
introductory
section
outlining
the
pluralistic
morally
neutral
and
subjective
nature
of
the
concept
of
conscience
the
four
main
aspects
of
conscience
that
will
be
described
are
the
following
section

discusses
conscience
as
a
faculty
for
selfknowledge
and
selfassessment
section
3
presents
the
epistemic
aspect
of
conscience
that
allows
the
formation
of
moral
beliefs
distinguishing
the
different
possible
sources
of
moral
principles
that
inform
such
beliefs
in
section
4
conscience
will
be
described
as
a
motivational
force
or
as
the
source
of
our
sense
of
duty
which
already
presupposes
a
body
of
moral
knowledge
or
of
moral
beliefs
finally
section
5
will
focus
on
conscience
understood
as
the
body
of
personal
core
and
selfidentifying
moral
beliefs
which
is
often
taken
to
be
the
basis
of
moral
integrity

of
our
sense
of

this
last
approach
to
conscience
is
often
used
with
a
political
function
to
advocate
freedom
of
thought
and

societies

conscience
as
pluralistic
neutral
and
subjective
the
concept
of
conscience
does
not
bear
any
connection
with
any
particular
substantial
moral
view
broad
1940
the
voice
of
conscience
might
suggest
different
principles
and
different
behaviors
to
different
people
in
other
words
there
is
no
psychological
or
conceptual
relation
between
conscience
and
any
particular
moral
belief
however
as
will
be
explained
below
in
the
catholic
tradition
the
idea
of
an
erroneous
conscience
is
sometimes
used
to
refer
to
conscience
that
fails
to
recognize
the
true
moral
laws
which
it
is
naturally
predisposed
to
“
witness
”
within
our
heart
as
for
secular
accounts
of
conscience
the
independence
of
the
notion
of
conscience
from
any
substantial
moral
content
can
be
understood
in
three
senses
first
conscience
is
a
pluralistic
notion
to
say
that
a
person
acted
with
conscience
or
that
something
violates
someone
s
conscience
does
not
entail
anything
about
what
this
act
consists
of
or
what
this
person
s
moral
values
are
although
it
might
tell
us
that
conscience
is
itself
a
value
this
person
holds
dear
to
use
a
metaphor
conscience
is
like
an
empty
box
that
can
be
filled
with
any
type
of
moral
content
as
put
by
strohm
conscience
has
what
might
be
called
an
“
identity
problem
”
—
that
it
possesses
no
fixed
or
inherited
content
of
its
own
and
that
it
can
be
hailed
and
mobilized
in
defence
of
one
position
or
equally
in
defence
for
example
while
some
health
practitioners
raise
“
conscientious
”
objection
to
abortion
and
refuse
to
provide
the
service
someone
s
conscience
might
demand
the
exact
opposite
i
e
to
perform
abortions
in
order
to
respect
what
is
conscientiously
believed
to
be
a
woman
s
right
joffe
1995
second
conscience
is
typically
a
morally
neutral
concept
appealing
to
conscience
does
not
usually
add
anything
to
the
moral
justification
of
any
particular
conduct
or
principle
unless
one
is
committed
to
the
relativistic
idea
that
your
belief
or
your
conscience
about
x
being
right
or
wrong
is
what
makes
it
right
or
wrong
for
you
to
do
x
foot
1979
something
is
not
made
morally
better
or
worse
acceptable
or
unacceptable
simply
by
being
a
matter
of
conscience
for
example
the
morality
of
abortion
has
nothing
to
do
with
abortion
being
conscientiously
opposed
by
some
health
practitioners
or
conscientiously
supported
by
others
this
neutrality
does
not
exclude
however
that
an
appeal
to
conscience
can
represent
itself
as
a
reason
for
respecting
someone
s
moral
views
for
example
a
reason
for
granting
someone
a
right
to
object
to
carrying
out
certain
activities
while
appeals
to
conscience
do
not
typically
provide
any
moral
reason
in
defense
of
a
certain
moral
stance
unless
one
is
a
relativist
they
might
ground
political
reasons
for
respecting
individuals
moral
beliefs
such
as
for
example
tolerance
or
pluralism
finally
conscience
only
concerns
the
subjective
dimension
of
morality
even
assuming
that
there
are
ethical
values
that
in
some
sense
can
be
considered
objective
conscience
only
refers
to
what
individuals
believe
independently
of
any
external
objective
proof
or
justification
and
when
people
state
what
they
subjectively
and
conscientiously
believe
they
acknowledge
that
other
people
might
and
probably
will
subjectively
and
conscientiously
hold
different
moral
views
thus
when
i
say
that
abortion
violates
my
conscience
i
am
not
saying
although
i
might
be
thinking
that
abortion
is
morally
wrong
by
some
objective
standard
and
i
m
not
necessarily
trying
to
convince
standard
these
three
aspects
related
to
the
independence
of
conscience
from
particular
substantial
moral
views
explain
why
appeals
to
conscience
to
justify
one
s
behavior
are
usually
made
with
the
expectation
that
no
further
reason
for
the
behavior
in
question
be
required
as
put
by
childress
when
an
agent
appeals
to
her
conscience
usually
the
agent
has
given
up
the
attempt
to
convince
others
of
the
rightness

conscience
as
selfknowledge
and
selfassessment
when
we
talk
about
conscience
we
often
refer
to
reflection
about
ourselves
as
moral
persons
and
about
our
moral
conduct
through
conscience
we
examine
ourselves
as
if
we
were
our
own
inner
judge
the
image
of
an
individual
split
into
two
persons
one
who
acts
and
the
other
who
observes
the
former
s
conduct
reflects
the
original
conception
of
“
conscience
”
in
the
greek
world
at
least
from
the
5th
century
bce

but
such
self
knowledge
may
also
be
thought
of
as
shared
with
others
inside
of
us
such
as
gods
or
other
actions
kant
1797
the
role
of
conscience
in
this
sense
is
not
that
of
merely
gaining
knowledge
about
our
behavior
or
character
the
knowledge
in
question
is
typically
though
as
explained
below
not
always
the
ground
for
a
moral
assessment
by
conscience
when
observing
one
s
behavior
conscience
is
more
like
a
judge
or
sometimes
it
is
identified
with
the
judgment
itself
than
like
a
disinterested
observer
thus
for
instance
the
impartial
spectator
with
which
adam
smith
identified
conscience
inspired
by
the
stoic
s
notion
of
conscience
as
an
imagined
admired
philosopher
judging
one
s
conduct
is
not
a
morally
and
emotionally
neutral
observer
but
generates
a
sentiment
of
approval
or
disapproval
of
oneself
smith
1759
and
discussion
in
raphael
2007

even
in
the
catholic
view
where
the
main
characterization
of
conscience
is
that
of
a
witness
of
god
s
law
in
our
hearts
as
described
in
section
3
conscience
is
also
presented
as
“
a
moral
judgment
about
man
and
his
actions
a
judgment
either
of
acquittal
or
condemnation
”

analogously
in
the
kantian
view
conscience
is
conceived
of
as
an
inner
court
wood
2008
184
it
is
moral
selfawareness
that
allows
one
to
apply
the
moral
law
suggested
by
practical
reason
to
our
moral
conduct
and
to
judge
whether
we
have
complied
with
the
moral
law
as
kant
defines
it
in
the
metaphysics
of
morals
conscience
is
practical
reason
holding
the
human
being
s
duty
before
him
for
his
consciousness
of
an
internal
court
in
man
kant
1797
1991
189
this
understanding
of
conscience
as
an
inner
court
is
well
illustrated
by
the
story
of
huckleberry
finn
in
mark
twain
s
famous
novel
twain
1884
bennett
1974
in
a
wellknown
episode
of
the
novel
huck
feels
guilty
and
blameworthy
for
having
helped
his
slave
friend
jim
to
escape
from
his
owner
miss
watson
blame
does
not
come
from
some
external
moral
authority
but
it
is
a
verdict
issued
by
conscience
according
to
its
moral
laws
the
bites
of
conscience
in
huck
s
case
were
caused
by
a
tension
between
his
feelings
supporting
what
he
did
and
the
principles
he
had
inherited
from
his
social
environment
at
the
time
when
the
novel
helping
slaves
run
away
meant
depriving
someone
of
her
private
property
this
was
the
“
law
”
metaphorically
speaking
against
which
huck
s
conscience
assessed
his
behavior
this
story
illustrates
another
interesting
feature
of
conscience
as
a
faculty
for
selfassessment
i
e
the
asymmetry
between
our
confidence
in
the
validity
of
the
moral
standards
provided
by
our
own
conscience
and
our
confidence
in
the
validity
of
the
standards
provided
other
people
s
conscience
huck
thinks
that
what
he
did
was
wrong
and
that
it
rendered
him
blameworthy
in
spite
of
his
feelings
because
he
thinks
that
his
own
conscience
provides
a
correct
moral
standard
i
e
a
standard
that
he
endorses
even
if
some
of
his
feelings
or
beliefs
indicate
otherwise
this
seems
to
reflect
our
common
way
of
relating
to
our
own
conscience
we
try
to
adjust
our
feelings
and
judgments
to
our
conscience
s
standard
rather
than
vice
versa
however
the
same
does
not
hold
when
we
talk
of
other
people
s
conscience
which
is
usually
taken
to
indicate
their
subjective
moral
standard
and
does
not
imply
that
we
are
endorsing
it
this
asymmetry
suggests
that
there
is
no
conceptual
relation
between
the
notion
of
conscience
per
se
and
the
notion
of
an
objective
or
correct
moral
standard
rather
it
stresses
once
more
the
fact
that
conscience
has
merely
to
do
with
one
s
private
morality
and
one
s
commitment
to
her
own
morality
consistently
with
this
understanding
of
conscience
as
selfknowledge
and
selfassessment
it
has
been
suggested
by
some
that
psychopaths
—
i
e
pathological
subjects
who
display
antisocial
behavior
and
systematically
act
without
regard
to
what
they
consider
to
be
right
or
wrong
—
can
be
said
to
lack
conscience
hare
1999
for
instance
according
to
vujošević
2015
in
psychopaths
the
link
between
moral
knowledge
or
beliefs
and
selfdirected
feelings
of
condemnation
e
g
guilt
is
as
mentioned
above
in
this
section
when
expressing
itself
through
selfevaluative
feelings
conscience
might
be
conceived
of
as
either
constituted
by
such
feelings
fuss
1964
or
as
occasioning
them
broad
1940
in
the
former
sense
conscience
as
constituted
by
selfevaluative
feelings
the
feeling
is
an
essential
part
of
conscience
conscience
in
this
case
is
better
conceived
not
as
a
judge
who
issues
sentences
but
as
a
feeling
with
cognitive
content
—
where
the
cognitive
content
concerns
cases
the
negative
feeling
informs
me
that
what
i
am
doing
or
am
contemplating
doing
is
wrong
according
to
my
own
moral
parameters
in
the
latter
sense
conscience
as
occasioning
selfevaluative
feelings
the
inner
judge
when
in
tension
with
one
s
conduct
generates
negative
selfdirected
feelings
mill

for
instance
in
freud
the
“
superego
”
—
the
part
of
our
personality
that
attends
to
prohibitions
inhibitions
and
moral
constraints
—
takes
“
the
form
of
conscience
”
to
exercise
its
control
over
one
s
impulses
and
instincts
by
producing
negative
evaluative
feelings
towards
the
individual
such
as
aggressiveness
towards
the
ego
and
guilt

1929

as
we
shall
see
below
in
section
4
these
selfdirected
negative
feelings
play
an
essential
role
in
fulfilling
the
motivational
function
of
conscience
as
the
characterization
of
conscience
as
selfassessment
here
presented
suggests
conscience
has
most
often
been
associated
with
negative
feelings
arendt
1971
such
as
shame
guilt
fear
contrition
for
most
of
us
even
in
our
common
language
conscience
is
something
that
yields
negative
feelings
more
often
than
not
—
for
example
we
often
talk
of
the
“
bites
of
conscience
”
or
of
conscience
as
causing
us
“
remorse
”
which
derives
from
the
latin
“
remordere
”
i
e
“
to
bite
again
”
however
a
joyful
conscience
that
praises
and
takes
pride
of
one
s
own
moral
merit
can
be
conceived
as
well
examples
of
joyful
conscience
can
be
found
for
instance
in
cicero
and
some
latin
stoics
most
prominently
seneca
sorabji

–

also
in
the
protestant
tradition
started
by
luther
we
find
the
idea
of
a
joyful
conscience
where
joy
springs
not
from
pride
or
selfpraise
but
from
awareness
of
god
s
future
remission
of
sins

the
contrast
between
the
protestant
joyful
conscience
and
the
catholic
conscience
burdened
by
negative
feelings
of
guilt
and
fear
was
emphasized
by
luther
when
he
denounced
the
“
terrorization
of
conscience
”
by
the
roman
catholic
church
according
to
luther
with
this
terrorization
the
roman
catholic
church
aimed
to
reinforce
its
authority
and
control
over
people
conscience
in
fact
conscience
in
the
catholic
tradition
can
only
be
relieved
from
its
burden

negative

the
epistemic
function
of
conscience
along
with
the
previous
nonepistemic
conception
of
conscience
we
can
also
understand
conscience
as
having
an
epistemic
function
in
this
sense
conscience
brings
us
some
form
of
moral
knowledge
or
moral
beliefs
—
either
in
an
absolute
sense
e
g
knowledge
of
divine
laws
or
in
a
relative
sense
e
g
knowledge
of
social
norms
in
one
s
culture
the
epistemic
role
of
conscience
does
not
necessarily
coincide
with
the
role
of
epistemic
faculties
or
functions
such
as
reason
intuitions
or
senses
in
particular
that
conscience
“
brings
”
us
moral
knowledge
or
beliefs
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
it
gives
us
direct
access
to
the
source
of
this
knowledge
or
of
these
beliefs
as
might
be
the
case
with
reason
intuitions
or
senses
the
knowledge
we
get
from
conscience
understood
as
possessing
an
epistemic
function
is
often
conceived
as
mediated
knowledge
this
is
not
surprising
since
as
we
have
seen
conscience
is
mostly
understood
as
inward
looking
which
presupposes
that
the
knowledge
to
which
it
gives
us
access
is
already
within
us
and
that
we
acquired
it
through
some
other
process
not
involving
conscience
in
fact
on
many
accounts
conscience
does
not
generate
its
own
moral
principles
for
example
the
moral
contents
we
discover
within
us
can
be
acquired
through
divine
intervention
as
is
the
case
with
the
laws
of
nature
which
according
to
christians
god
infuses
in
our
heart
as
we
are
going
to
see
in
subsection

the
understanding
of
conscience
as
having
an
epistemic
function
and
as
the
recipient
of
mediated
knowledge
is
not
exclusive
to
religious
views
on
other
accounts
of
conscience
however
conscience
does
give
us
direct
access
to
moral
knowledge
for
example
as
an
intuition
about
what
is
good
and
what
is
bad
let
us
examine
the
two
accounts
of
the
epistemic
role
of
conscience
in
more
detail

conscience
as
a
faculty
for
indirect
moral
knowledge
in
the
christian
tradition
starting
from
paul
the
inward
looking
character
of
conscience
is
emphasized
by
the
metaphor
of
the

conscience
does
not
allow
us
to
acquire
the
knowledge
of
the
moral
law
directly
from
an
external
source
god
in
this
case
but
only
to
witness
the
presence
of
god
s
laws
within
us
conscience
cannot
directly
contemplate
god
the
idea
of
a
faculty
that
gives
us
indirect
and
therefore
imperfect
knowledge
of
some
external
moral
authority
suits
religious
traditions
very
well
for
example

idea
that
through
conscience
we
discover
the
true
divine
laws
can
also
be
found
in

it
is
important
to
note
that
also
in
this
case
as
in
the
previous
understanding
of
conscience
as
selfawareness
and
selfassessment
conscience
can
be
conceived
as
fulfilling
an
introspective
function
i
e
as
being
directed
towards
the
self
and
towards
one
s
own
mental
states
introspection
allows
one
to
gain
selfknowledge
schwitzgebel
before
his
papacy
joseph
ratzinger
said
that
“
something
like
an
original
memory
of
the
good
and
the
true
the
two
are
identical
has
been
implanted
in
us
”
and
conscience
is
so
to
speak
an
inner
sense
a
capacity
to
recall
so
that
the
one
whom
the
catholic
church
also
makes
reference
to
“

voice
of
the

the

cardinal
john
henry
newman
for
instance
saw
conscience
as
the
moral
sense
that
can
lead
us
to
the
moral
truth
as
such
conscience
is
in
his
view
both
epistemic
and
action
guiding
but
the
two
aspects
are
not
distinguishable
to
the
extent
that
the
moral
truth
is
what
guides
our
actions
as
he
wrote
“
the
feeling
of
conscience
is
twofold
it
is
a
moral
sense
and
a
sense
of
duty
a
judgment
of
the
reason
and
a
magisterial
dictate
of
course
its
act
is
indivisible

moral
principles
in
us
is
not
god
but
one
s
own
culture
or
upbringing
in
this
case
the
moral
knowledge
in
question
is
typically
understood
in
a
relativistic
sense
our
conscience
is
the
faculty
through
which
the
social
norms
of
our
culture
or
the
norms
of
our
upbringing
are
evoked
and
exert
their
influence
on
our
moral
psychology
these
norms
explain
our
moral
feelings
and
our
moral
choices
but
what
conscience
tells
us
in
this
case
is
the
product
of
social
and
cultural
dynamics
over
which
we
have
little
control
as
the
case
of
huckleberry
finn
s
conscience
demonstrates
hardly
can
conscience
so
understood
be
credited
any
moral
authority
since
our
educators
or
our
culture
might
be
highly
immoral
for
example
our
conscience
might
end
up
drawing
on
racist
or
discriminatory
principles
such
as
the
ones
which
supported
slavery
in
huck
s
social
environment
and
in
fact
unsurprisingly
many
are
rather
skeptical
or
dismissive
of
the
moral
authority
of
conscience
since
they
see
it
as
mere
opinion
about
moral
principles
influenced
or
even
determined
by
one
s
own
culture

conscience
as
a
faculty
for
direct
moral
knowledge
contrary
to
what
montaigne
and
hobbes
had
claimed
rousseau
argued
in
emile
or
education
that
good
education
can
free
conscience
from
the
corrupting
influences
of
societies
actually
one
of
the
aims
of
education
is
to
render
the
young
autonomous
moral
thinkers
and
agents
by
teaching
them
how
to
critically
examine
and
if
necessary
replace
received
norms
rousseau
1762
see
sorabji
2014
for
a
discussion
the
idea
here
is
that
conscience
is
what
remains
of
our
innate
moral
sense
once
we
free
it
from
“
childish
errors
”
and
“
prejudices
of
our
upbringing
”
rousseau
1921
1762
253
as
rousseau
presents
it
justice
and
virtue
by
which
in
spite
of
our
maxims
we
judge
our
own
actions
or
those
of
others
to
be
good
or
evil
and
it
is
this
principle
that
i
call
conscience
rousseau
1921
1762
253
according
to
rousseau
then
conscience
has
a
natural
tendency
to
perceive
and
follow
the
right
order
of
nature
and
a
good
teacher
should
help
the
young
s
conscience
to
do
what
it
is
naturally
predisposed
to
do
in
rousseau
s
words
too
often
does
reason
deceive
us
we
have
only
too
good
a
right
to
doubt
her
but
conscience
never
deceives
us
she
is
the
true
guide
of
man
it
is
to
the
soul
what
instinct
is
to
the
body
he
who
obeys
his
conscience
is
following
nature
and
he
need
not
fear
that
he
will
go
astray
let
us
obey
the
call
of
nature
we
shall
see
that
her
yoke
is
easy
and
that
when
we
give
heed
to
her
voice
we
find
a
joy
in
the
answer
of
a
good
conscience
rousseau

this
understanding
of
conscience
as
a
deeper
form
of
moral
knowledge
brings
us
to
the
second
sense
in
which
conscience
can
be
said
to
have
an
epistemic
role
as
well
as
merely
witnessing
received
opinions
or
divine

conscience
can
also
be
conceived
as
a
moral
sense
giving
us
direct
access
to
moral
principles
understood
in
this
way
conscience
is
typically
seen
as

conscience
for

is
therefore
not

an

conscience
s
selfassessment
often
produces
remorse
or
other
negative
feelings
guilt
shame
fear
and
so
on
our
desire
or
tendency
to
avoid
this
form
of
selfpunishment
can
have
motivational
force
towards
acting
morally
thus
for
instance
according
to
childress
the
motive
for
acting
morally
that
defines
conscience
is
“
in

avoidance

consistent
with
this
philosophical
view
are
studies
in
developmental
psychology
suggesting
that
the
emotion
of
guilt
which
is
typically
seen
as
one
of
the
products
of
conscience
as
selfassessment
is
“
the

engine

but
the
sense
of

that
identifies

can
also
be
conceived
as
a
primitive

an
innate
disposition
which
is
not
explained
by
any
other
more
fundamental
mechanism
in

for

human

being

a

”
kant

and
conscience
is
one
of
the
four
“

predispositions

concepts
of
duty
”
the
other
three
being
moral

s
negative
feelings
and
sense
of

are
not
always
successful
in
prompting
agents
to
do
what
their
moral
principles
require
but
the
“
bites
of
conscience
”
or
just
the
prospect
of
bites
of
conscience
act
as
motivational
force
towards
aligning
our
future
behavior
to
those
norms
of
course
positive
feelings
associated
with
conscience
might
also
have
a
motivational
force
for
example
as
seen
above
kant
associated
conscience
also
with
positive
feelings
about
oneself
when
the
agent
recognizes
he
has
acted
according
to
his
sense
of
duty
rousseau
alongside
the
epistemic
account
of
conscience
presented
above
also
provides
in
emile
a
motivational
account
of
conscience
based
on
positive
feelings
while
reason
gives
us
knowledge
of
the
good
it
is

through
a
sentiment
of
love
for
the
good
which

conscience
—
particularly
by
advancing
so
called
“
conscientious
objection
”
—
when
social
expectations
or
legal
obligations
would
demand
otherwise
these
political
appeals
to
conscience
are
usually
made
on
the
basis
of
two
principles
the
first
is
the
principle
of
respect
for
moral
integrity
which
finds
its
justification
in
the
close
relationship
between
the
notions
of
conscience
and
of
moral
integrity
on
one
side
childress
1979
and
the
sense
of
personal
identity
on
the
other
the
second
principle
often
invoked
in
the
political
uses
of
“
conscience
”
is
the
principle
of
“
freedom
of
conscience
”
the
former
will
be
discussed
in
this
section
and
the
latter
in
the
next
section
the
concept
of
personal
identity
in
the
sense
in
which
the
notion
is
used
here
—
i
e
what
defines
me
as
this
particular
person
in
a
qualitative
sense
—
is
intimately
related
to
the
notions
of
conscience

conscience
as
selfidentifying
can
be
understood
in
two
ways
it
can
be
thought
of
either
as
a
set
of
core
and
selfidentifying
moral
beliefs
that
are
“
integral
to
an
agent

understanding
of
who
she

e
her

s

and

”

conceived
in
either
way
conscience
is
an
essential
part
of
our
understanding
of
what
kind
of
person
we
are
and
this
is
taken
to
be
a
reason
for
warranting
protection
of
conscience
and
conscientious
objection
in
different
contexts
particularly
in
the
health

we
have
seen
above
that
there
is
a
sense
in
which
according
to
some
psychopaths
can
be
said
to
lack
conscience
hare
1999
psychopaths
are
not
capable
of
connecting
their
moral
knowledge
to
their
conduct
through
the
feelings
of
guilt
and
disapproval
which
conscience
on
some
accounts
produces
interestingly
according
to
some
psychologists
psychopaths
are
also
less
likely
to
base
their
sense
of
personal
leads
us
to
say
that
a
certain
individual
is
not
the
same
person
anymore
strohminger
and

these
findings
provide
empirical
support
to
the
idea
that
conscience
is
essential
to
one
s
sense
of
personal
identity
and
to
attributions
of
personal
identity

freedom
of
conscience
some
people
have
suggested
that
appeals
to
freedom
of
conscience
tend
to
be
more
vigorously
put
forward
and
more
effective
in
contexts
where
political
or
religious
structures
lose
power
or
moral
authority
thus
for
instance
according
to
c
a
pierce
conscience
only
came
into
its
own
in
the
greek
world
after
the
collapse
of
the
citystate
the
close
integration
of
politics
with
ethics
with
the
former
predominant
was
no
longer
possible
there
was
no
sufficiently
close
authority
external
to
the
individual
effectively
to
direct
conduct
consequently
as
a
pis
aller
men
fell
back
on
the
internal
chastisement
of
the
conscience
as
the
only
authority
pierce
1955
76
the
same
can
be
said
for
17th
century
england
with
its
crisis
of
religious
authority
and
the
frequent
appeals
to
freedom
of
conscience
in
the
philosophical
and
political
literature
of
that
time
childress
1979
326
there
are
three
main
arguments
that
can
be
used
to
defend
a
principle
of
freedom
of
conscience
two
of
them
are
frequently
found
in
the
16th
and
17th
century
philosophical
literature
they
are
the
“
argument
from
ineffectiveness
or
hypocrisy
”
and
the
“
argument
from
ignorance
”
a
the
argument
from
ineffectiveness
or
hypocrisy
is
based
on
the
relevance
of
the
distinction
between
beliefs
and
acts
for
the
definition
of
conscience
according
to
this
argument
it
is
not
possible
to
compel
someone
to
believe
or
to
not
believe
something
i
e
to
change
one
s
conscientious
beliefs
all
we
can
do
is
compel
people
to
act
as
if
they
if
some
authority
aims
to
convert
people
or
to
change
people
s
moral
views
prohibiting
the
free
expression
through
actions
of
one
s
conscience
would
not
serve
this
purpose
this
line
of
argument
was
often
put
forward
by
early
christians
most
practice
their
cult
in
a
time
where
they
were
persecuted
by
roman
governors
their
claim
was
that
forcing
them
to
abandon
the
christian
cults
would
have
no
effect
on
their
conscience
the
same
line
of
argument
can
also
be
found
in
locke
s
works
on
toleration
the
essay
concerning
toleration
of
1667
and
a
letter
concerning
toleration
of
however
christians
did
not
seem
to
believe
in
the
force
of
this
argument
and
more
generally
in
the
principle
of
freedom
of
conscience
when
later
on
they
attempted
to
justify
the
violent
persecution
of
heretics
those
who
revise
their
religious
dogmas
and
apostates
those
to
follow
the
true
religion
—
by
which
he
meant
persecuting
heretics
—
could
open
their
eyes
to
the
truth
sorabji

this
thesis
implies
that
sometimes
conscience
even
if
we
confine
it
to
matters
of
inward
conviction
and
not
to
behavior
can
be
influenced
by
some
external
imposition
this
latter
approach
based
on
the
idea
of
bringing
the
truth
to
conscience
by
“
freeing
”
conscience
from
error
is
consistent
with
the
catholic
peculiar
understanding
of
the
notion
of
freedom
of
conscience
philosophically
speaking
“
freedom
of
conscience
”
is
typically
understood
as
an
individualistic
concept
that
allows
for
a
plurality
of
moral
and
religious
views
strohm
2011
90
for
the
catholic
church
newman
joseph
ratzinger
writes
that
in
the
catholic
view
“
truth
”
is
the
middle
term
that
reconciles
authority
of
god
and
subjectivity
of
conscience
the
latter
when
authentically
free
cannot
but
reveal
the
truth
established
by
the
former
ratzinger
1991
2010
since
as
we
have
seen
above
in
the
catholic
view
reason
alone
can
t
create
its
own
of
that
law
”
of
god
john
paul
ii
1993
par

so
when
practical
reason
is
free
to
exercise
its
“
participation
”
john
paul
ii
1993
sec
40
in
the
divine
law
then
“
in
the
depths
of
his

man
detects
a
law
which
he
does
not
impose

himself
but
which
holds
him
to
obedience
”
paul
vi
1965
par

in
any
case
it
is
not
necessary
to
dismiss
the
argument
from
ineffectiveness
in
order
to
justify
imposing
norms
and
practices
that
might
violate
individuals
conscience
actually
the
same
argument
from
ineffectiveness
can
be
used
to
support
the
imposition
of
policies
that
might
conflict
with
individuals
consciences
on
the
basis
of
the
idea
that
conscience
is
merely
a
matter
of
private
beliefs
not
of
action
some
authors
have
argued
that
compelling
people
to
follow
certain
rules
even
against
their
conscience
would
not
constitute
a
violation
of
their
freedom
of
conscience
and
is
therefore
justifiable
this
was
the
line
of
argument
pursued
for
example
by
thomas
hobbes
1651
chapter
40
baruch
spinoza
1670
chapter
20
and
john
locke
1660
who
argued
that
the
state
has
the
power
to
enforce
certain
practices
even
when
citizens
claim
that
it
would
violate
their
conscience
in
order
to
protect
social
order
b
the
“
argument
from
ignorance
”
which
might
be
better
labeled
“
argument
from
humility
”
is
based
on
a
skeptical
approach
to
the
content
of
conscience
the
possibility
exists
that
what
we
conscientiously
believe
is
wrong
and
that
those
holding
conscientious
beliefs
opposite
to
ours
are
right
therefore
there
is
a
reason
for
not
a
significant
proportion
of
its
religious
and
moral
authority
following
the
protestant
reform
in
16th
and
17th
century
—
which
was
defined
by
keith
thomas
1993
as
“
the
age
of
conscience
”
it
was
at
that
time
that
we
assisted
to
the
“
secularization
of
conscience
”
in
the
modern
era
strohm
2011
although
the
phenomenon
would
be
better
conceived
of
as
a
“
resecularization
”
since
conscience
was
not
related
to
the
voice
or
the
authority
of
god
in
the
greek
world
john
locke
in
his
second
letter
concerning
toleration
locke
had
to
rely
on
this
argument
as
an
alternative
strategy
to
defend
freedom
of
conscience
after
the
anglican
priest
jonas
proast
pointed
out
that
compulsion
can
actually
change
personal
beliefs
as
augustine
had
argued
and
that
therefore
the
argument
from
ineffectiveness
that
locke
conscientious
objection
in
health
care
c
finally
the
third
argument
in
defense
of
freedom
of
conscience
is
what
i
have
called
above
the
“
argument
from
legitimization
”
john
stuart
mill
1859
defended
freedom
of
conscience
by
appealing
to
the
idea
that
allowing
the
free
expression
of
any
opinion
and
particularly
mistaken
opinions
would
allow
truth
to
emerge
more
clearly
and
would
provide
us
any
rational
assurance
of
being
right

by

according
to
strohm
this
article
should
not
be
taken
to
imply
freedom
to
act
according
to
one
s
conscience
but
it
only
refers
to
“
matters
of
inward
conviction
”
strohm

if
this
interpretation
is
correct
article

does
not
seem
to
raise
any
interesting
philosophical
or
matters
of
inward
conviction
more
problematic
is
the
moral
and
political
debate
about
the
freedom
to
act
or
to
refrain
from
acting
according
to
one
s
conscience
especially
where
there
are
professional
roles
or
legal
obligations
that
would
demand
otherwise
in
fact
appeals
to
conscience
and
freedom
of
conscience
are
often
deployed
to
claim
and
justify
“
conscientious
objection
”
to
certain
activities
that
someone
would
otherwise
be
required
to
perform
as
most
states
have
now
abolished
conscription
appeals
to
freedom
of
conscience
and
to
conscientious
objection
today
can
be
found
mainly
in
debates
in
medical
ethics
with
regard
to
health
practitioners
who
conscientiously
object
to
performing
medical
procedures
they
morally
according
to
those
who
are
against
a
right
to
conscientious

professional
obligations
trump
any
value
conscience
might
have
and
any
principle
that
might

conclusion
there
is
no
such
a
thing
as
the
notion
of
conscience
both
in
a
philosophical
and
in
a
psychological
sense
as
we
have
seen
the
concept
of
conscience
has
been
given
different
interpretations
throughout
history
sometimes
on
the
basis
of
underlying
systematic
philosophical
theories
of
the
mind
and
of
morality
and
sometimes
serving
religious
or
this
lack
of
uniformity
is
not
only
a
problem
for
historians
and
theoretical
philosophers
because
it
cannot
be
immediately
clear
what
we
are
talking
about
when
we
talk
of
conscience
of
freedom
of
conscience
or
of
conscientious
objection
it
is
important
that
clarity
is
made
every
time
conscience
is
appealed
to
in
different
branches
of
applied
philosophy
particularly
medical
ethics
and
in
public
debates
alike
this
entry
has
presented
a
conceptual
map
rather
than
a
historical
account
of
conscience
which
can
provide
some
guidance
for
those
engaged
in
this
clarificatory
task
one
of
the
benefits
of
clarifying
concepts
and
clarifying
them
in
the
different
circumstances
in
which
they
are
used
is
their
subsequent
demystification
conscience
needs
to
be
demystified
since
it
is
one
of
those
concepts
that
tend
to
elicit
reverence
rather
than
questions
or
an
interest
in
further
inquiry
as
seen
above
appeals
to
conscience
often
replace
reason
giving
and
are
made
with
the
expectation
that
no
further
reason
for
one
s
decisions
and
positions
is
requested
this
attitude
is
also
displayed
in
many
legislative
approaches
dealing
with
the
notion
of
conscience
in
particular
legislations
about
conscientious
objection
in
health
care
typically
grant
doctors
a
right
to
object
to
performing
certain
professional
activities
e
g
conscientious
objection
to
let
alone
submitting
reasons
to
some
form
of
assessment
this
entry
has
distinguished
four
main
understandings
of
conscience
drawing
on
the
philosophical
tradition
of
the
concept
whether
the
concept
is
to
be
understood
as
a
faculty
for
selfknowledge
and
selfidentifying
moral
beliefs
or
a
combination
of
any
of
these
characterizations
it
is
important
to
have
clear
in
mind
what
exactly
we
are
talking
about
when
we
talk
of
conscience
and
of
freedom
of
conscience
in
each
circumstance
far
from
being
a
conversationstopper
conscience
can
only
find
its
proper
place
in
philosophical
and
in
public
discussion
if
its
philosophical
and
psychological
aspects
are
teased
out
defined
and
assessed
appeals
to
conscience
can
only
be
part
of
philosophical
political
and
legal
discussion
if
they
are
seen
as
the
start
not
the
end

the
role

conclusion
way
forward
 
moral
conscience
 
is
a
part
of
the
cognitive
process
in
mind
that
tells
whether
an
act
is
morally
right
or
wrong
in
other
words
it
is
awareness
of
moral
principles
and
whether
act
done
is
in
accordance
with
these
principles
or
not
it
is
an
instrument
for
selfcontrol
correction
and
regulation
the
proper
understanding
of
the
moral
conscience
is
basic
to
our
understanding
of
morality
and
to
an
ethical
conduct
role
of
moral
conscience
in
ethical
behaviour
1
right
choices
human
actions
entail
free
decisions
concerning
ends
concern
making
right
choices
based
on
the
analysis
of
the
nature
of
acts
and
the
intentions
and
circumstances
that
are
involved
moral
conscience
help
guide
people
to
follow
the
right
means
to
a
right
end
2
inner
guide
moral
conscience
is
our
inner
guide
and
it
helps
you
figure
out
how
to
make
good
choices
as
we
grow
up
we
learn
right
from
wrong
our
moral
conscience
is
the
thought
and
feeling
we
have
that
tells
us
whether
something
is
a
right
or
wrong
thing
to
do
or
say
thus
it
is
a
consistent
guide
to
ethical
decision
making
3
source
of
information
the
moral
conscience
is
considered
the
proximate
norm
of
conduct
because
it
is
the
immediate
source
of
information
guiding
human
actions
it
directs
human
actions
so
that
a
person
can
transcend
his
animal
instincts
and
human
inclinations
moral
conscience
allows
man
to
exercise
reason
and
thus
allow
an
objective
decision
and
act
based
on
right
values
4
decision
making
without
moral
conscience
a
person
would
doubt
even
the
smallest
decisions
since
the
judgment
of
moral
conscience
is
a
judgment
about
how
an
action
conforms
or
does
not
conform
to
natural
law
then
it
is
obligatory
to
act
according
to
one
s
conscience
although
there
are
persons
who
have
a
doubtful
conscience
which
renders
them
unable
to
decide
upon
actions
easily
a
wellformed
moral
conscience
is
effective
because
it
makes
practical
judgments
with
relative
ease
or
after
seeking
necessary
advice
5
resolving
ethical
dilemmas
a
human
being
always
comes
across
ethical
dilemmas
in
the
decision
making
process
moral
conscience
acts
as
the
guide
for
taking
correct
decisions
when
we
have
to
choose
between
competing
sets
of
principles
in
a
given
usually
undesirable
or
perplexing
situation
example
 
helping
accident
victims
on
your
way
to
an
interview
6
rational
decision
through
our
individual
moral
conscience
one
becomes
aware
of
his
deeply
held
moral
principles
and
motivates
accordingly
to
act
upon
those
principles
removing
conflicts
as
we
assess
our
character
our
behaviour
and
ultimately
our
self
against
those
principles
conscience
leads
to
proper
analysis
of
good
and
bad
of
the
situation
and
proper
evaluation
of
various
options
7
ethical
awareness
this
is
our
ability
to
recognise
ethical
values
and
principles
the
moral
conscience
enables
the
human
mind
to
understand
the
world
in
moral
terms
this
enhances
our
ability
to
make
practical
decisions
in
light
of
ethical
values
and
principles
important
in
public
services
tostay
impartial
it
is
important
that
public
servants
must
object
to
any
favours
and
corrupt
activities
moral
conscience
helps
in
conscientious
objection
by
making
an
individual
aware
of
the
impact
of
his
decisions
on
larger
public
limitation
of
moral
conscience
in
ethical
behaviour
1
individuality
moral
conscience
is
highly
personal
and
varies
with
individuals
for
example
a
person
might
think
killing
muslim
as
moral
in
order
to
take
revenge
in
his
conscience
it
is
moral
to
kill
muslim
and
help
hindu
cause
2
social
norms
moral
conscience
is
guided
by
the
social
norms
in
general
it
can
impact
the
ethical
thinking
of
an
individual
leading
to
unethical
behaviour
for
example
in
islamic
countries
many
are
misguided
in
name
of
jihad
and
act
of
terrorism
is
held
moral
and
as
an
act
of
sacrifice
for
the
cause
of
religion
3
courage
despite
being
morally
conscience
about
what
is
right
an
individual
might
lack
courage
to
act
ethically
for
example
a
civil
servant
might
know
that
his
colleague
is
taking
bribes
he
may
not
etc
define
an
individual
s
morals
thus
one
might
not
know
what
he
is
doing
is
immoral
for
example
a
person
might
beat
his
wife
as
in
his
conscience
mind
it
is
not
immoral
due
to
patriarchal
mindset
thus
the
moral
conscience
plays
an
important
role
in
making
moral
decisions
and
actions
the
reason
behind
conscience
as
the
ultimate
highest
determiner
of
moral
action
and
its
authority
is
the
idea
that
when
conscience
and
all
other
principles
are
properly
understood
they
promote
and
motivate
us
to
act
that
are
in
accordance
with
our
nature

to

how
does
the

differ
from
the

being
conscious
is
the
state
of
being
awake
and
alert
conscience
on
the
other
hand
refers
to
an
awareness
of
whether
actions
are
right
or
wrong
at
a
glance
while
the
two
terms
are
often
confused
the
conscious
and
the
conscience
refer
to
very
different
things
your
conscious
allows
you
to
be
aware
of
your
place
in
the
world
while
your
conscience
allows
you
to
behave
in
this
world
in
morally
and
socially
acceptable
ways
as
described
below
being
conscious
refers
to
your
awareness
of
yourself
and
the
world
around
you
your
conscience
is
your
ability
to
distinguish
between
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
what
does
conscience
mean
your
conscience
is
the
part
of
your
personality
that
helps
you
determine
right
and
wrong
and
keeps
you
from
acting
upon
your
most
basic
urges
and
desires
your
conscience
is
what
makes
you
feel
guilty
when
you
do
something
bad
and
good
when
you
do
something
kind
even
altruistic
ways
in
freudian
theory
the
conscience
is
part
of
the
superego
that
contains
information
about
what
is
viewed
as
bad
or
negative
by
your
parents
and
by
society
—
all
the
values
you
learned
and
absorbed
during
your
upbringing
the
conscience
emerges
over
time
as
you
take
in
information
about
what
is
considered
right
and
wrong
by
your
caregivers
your
peers
and
the
culture
in
which
you
live

s
rules
for
example
if
a
parent
sets
a
rule
a
child
could
learn
a
sense
of
right
and
wrong
regarding
that
topic
studies
have
also
examined
other
factors
that
may
affect
the
way
conscience
develops
including
the
nature
of
the
parentchild
relationship
style
of
parental
discipline
and
the
child
s
temperament
—
but
more
research
is
needed
breaking
down
the
differences
conscience
noun
to
further
explain
their
differences
here
are
examples
of
how
the
terms
conscience
and
conscious
could
be
used
in
a
sentence
conscience
they
had
a
guilty
conscience
because
they
cheated
on
the
test
the
term
conscience
here
describes
this
person
s
sense
of
what
is
right
and
wrong
and
the
subsequent
feeling
of
guilt
they
have
over
cheating
on
the
test
when
thinking
about
these
two
concepts
just
remember
that
conscious
means
to
be
awake
and
aware
while
conscience
refers
to
your
inner
sense
of
right
and
wrong
common
uses
guilty
conscience
indicates
that
someone
feels
guilty
about
their
actions
clear
conscience
suggests
that
people
 
conscious
of
your
words
suggests
that
you
are
aware
of
the
effect
your
words
may
have
and
thus
choose
them
with
caution
aware
it
s
definitely
easy
to
confuse
the
terms
conscious
and
conscience
particularly
when
you
hear
the
words
spoken

guilt
or
guilty
conscience
is
one
of
the
most
common
negative
or
sad
emotions
that
people
experience
almost
every
day
if
not
addressed
properly
a
guilty
conscience
can
destroy
your
relationship
steal
your
joy
your
happiness
and
even
your
future
yet
the
majority
of
us
don
t
know
how
to
deal
with
it
in
a
healthy
way
according
to
the
german
philosopher
friedrich
nietzsche
1844
1900
a
guilty
conscience
can
push
a
person
to
become
very
cruel
and
do
horrible
things
as
a
result
horrible
things
like
killing
committing
suicide
etc
yet
just
like
any
other
emotions
there
s
not
a
clear
definition
for
a
guilty
conscience
so
to
better
understand
what
it
is
one
has
to
explore
the
concept
of
right
and
wrong
within
society
himselfherself
a
getoutjailfree
card
in
this
universe
to
maintain
emotional
and
psychological
balance
it
is
necessary
to
experience
guilt
for
our
bad
behavior
or
actions
besides
a
guilty
conscience
is
like
having
a
snooze
alarm
in
your
head
that
won
t
shut
off
until
it
is
addressed
and
it
has
to
be
addressed
in
a
healthy
way
if
not
addressed
properly
a
guilty
conscience
will
make
it
very
hard
for
you
to
think
straight
and
make
the
right
decisions
when
necessary
a
guilty
conscience
can
also
trigger
shame
anger
emptiness
and
in
many
cases
sabotage
your
entire
life
and
your
relationship
with
others
a
guilty
conscience
that
is
not
addressed
properly
will
also
make
you
become
very
paranoid
and
delusional
for
example
a
guilty
conscience
may
make
you
feel
that
everything
people
say
or
write
in
their
social
media
pages
is
about
you
and
then
consider
it
as
a
personal
attack
such
behavior
will
eventually
throw
you
off
balance
emotionally
and
psychologically
and
make
you
a
good
candidate
for
anxiety
depression
or
much
worse
a
guilty
conscience
can
also
make
you
hate
and
punish
yourself
avoid
hearing
nor
seeing
the
person
that
you
ve
wronged
it
will
also
push
you
to
talk
negatively
about
that
person
in
order
to
more
harm
to
himher
should
you
get
the
opportunity
how
to
effectively
deal
with
a
guilty
conscience
1
the
first
step
in
dealing
with
a
guilty
conscience
is
always
to
surrender
to
the
truth
repentance
this
means
to
stop
fighting
or
denying
your
guilt
because
the
more
you
deny
it
the
more
intense
the
environment
as
soon
as
you
can
3
the
third
step
in
dealing
with
a
guilty
conscience
is
to
keep
your
emotions
and
behavior
in
check
at
all
time
there
s
nothing
more
embarrassing
for
a
person
than
not
being
unable
to
control
hisher
doing
things
it
will
repeat
itself
in
your
future
also
6
the
sixth
and
final
step
is
to
always
seek
professional
help
psychologist
if
feel
like
you
re
overwhelmed
by
a
guilty
conscience
because
it
can
lead
to

in

theory

i
argue
that

offers
a
distinction
between

and

moral
rules
that
sidesteps
the
traditional
distinction
between
universal
and
relative
moral
standards
leading
to
a
fundamental
rethinking
of
the
problem
of
the
variability
of
moral
opinion
and
the
demands
of
moral
conscience
and
duty

of
his
mentor
francis
hutcheson
and
of
his
friend
david
impartial
spectator
position
to
correct
for
any
bias
in
our
judgments
smith
s
notion
of
moral
conscience
follows
directly
from
this
general
approach
he
believes
we
cultivate
a
moral
conscience
by
learning
to
view
ourselves
our
intentions
and
our
actions
from
a
position
of
impartial
spectatorship
from
this
position
we
cultivate
a
concern
with
praiseworthiness
and
blameworthiness
not
praise
and
blame
being
virtuous
and
having
a
fully
developed
moral
conscience
for
smith
represents
the
highest
stage
in
the
moral
development
of
an
individual
what
is
fit
and
proper
either
to
be
done
or
to
be
avoided
”

the
specific
mechanism
by
which
these
rules
are
formed
is
considerably
different
from
the
cultivation
of
conscience
take
the
emergence
of
negative
rules
or
commands
that
order
us
not
to
do
something
we
observe
another
s
behavior
and
disapprove
of
it
we
hear
others
express
similar
words
general
moral
rules
are
formed
out
of
our
judgments
of
particular
experiences
that
we
observe
in
conjunction
with
the
judgments
of
others
a
desire
for
praise
or
an
aversion
to
blame
not
the
moral
conscience
s
concern
for
praiseworthiness
or
aversion
to
blameworthiness
compels
us
to
develop
them
after
these
general
rules
are
formed
and
“
universally
notion
of
the
universality
of
the
moral
standards
that
have
emerged
in
the
society
in
which
we
live
finally
this
view
explains
how
tensions
arise
when
the
judgments
of
our
moral
conscience
might
be
displaced
or
at
least
come
into
conflict
with
the
general
rules
that
are
established
in
a
particular
society
and
to
which
we

sentimental
attachments

the
tension
between
conscience
and
duty
for
smith
humans
are
subject
to
multiple
commands
in
ethics
some
stemming
from
the
dictates
of
conscience
and
others
from
duty
when
should
the
principle
of
duty
be
the
sole
principle
regulating
our
conduct
in
the
world
and
when
should
it
concur
with
other
motives
such
as
those
provided
by
moral
conscience
conscience
and
duty
introduce
tension
into
smith
s
understanding
of
moral
judgement
and
action
in
the
theory
of
moral
sentiments
understanding
that
tension
between
the
demands
of
conscience
and
duty
lies
at
the
heart
of
the
final
chapter
of
part
vi
some
moral
judgements
are
guided
primarily
by
moral
conscience
others
are
guided
by
general
rules
and
our
sense
of
duty
given
the
characteristics
of
a
particular
passion
individuals
may
face
a
difficult
task
of
balancing
between
the
demands
of
conscience
and
of
duty
for
example
regarding
benevolent
and
social
sentiments
like
love
our
moral
judgements
and
actions
flow
naturally
from
our
benevolent
parliament
seeking
reelection
or
a
tradesman
seeking
a
special
job
must
be
grounded
at
least
in
part
by
the
passion
of
ambition
and
not
just
duty
or
conscience
for
successful
advancement
and
social
recognition
a
second
issue
that
follows
from
the
distinction
between
conscience
and
duty
involves
the
precision
and
exactness
of
the
general
moral
rules
themselves
some
rules
are
clearer
and
more
important
to
society
than
theory
of
moral
sentiments
and
remains
prone
to
misinterpretation
one
might
easily
argue
that
what
smith
means
to
say
is
that
the
conclusions
of
conscience
are
the
general
laws
of
morality
backed
by
our
religious
sentiment
from
this
interpretation
conscience
can
easily
be
identified
as
“
vicegerents
of
god
”
that
reward
us
for
following
the
law
and
punish
us
for
breaking
it
if
my
reading
of
the
sharp
distinction
between
duty
and
conscience
is
correct
this
reading
is
seriously
mistaken
as
i
argue
above
our
general
rules
of
morality
are
generalizations
based
upon
our
observations
of
our
moral
judgments
in
conjunction
with
those
of
others
they
are
not
conclusions
of
our
moral
conscience
conscience
deals
with
the
problem
of
praiseworthiness
duty
centers
upon
the
problem
of
praise
all
people
have
the
capacity
for
moral
generalization
all
people
do
not
have
a
highly
functioning
moral
sense
of
conscience
the
“
vicegerents
of
god
”
that
smith
is
referring
to
are
not
just
the
sentiments
involved
with
conscience
they
encompass
all
our
moral
faculties
including
our
sense
of
propriety
and
impropriety
our
sense
of
merit
and
demerit
and
our
sense
of
duty
the
significance
of
the
distinction
between
conscience
and
duty
in
smith
s
thought
is
revealed
most
clearly
at
the
end
of
chapter
v
in
part
iii
smith
emphasizes
that
while
he
wants
to
distinguish
between
duty
and
conscience
he
does
not
want
to
say
they
are
necessarily
antithetical
to
one
another
on
the
contrary
for
the
most
part
they
complement
one
another
he
comments
that
“
the
general
rules
by
which
there
are
natural
limits
to
what
we
can
do
to
impose
the
teaching
of
our

upon
the
world

that
does
not
mean
that
we
must
deny
our
consciences
out
of
hand
indignation
in
the
face
of
perceived
unfairness
is
a
natural
response
of
our
conscience

the

may
not
always
be
able

construct

how
can
i
have
a
good
conscience
labors
on
this
podcast
my
question
is
one
that
i
have
struggled
with
for
over
two
decades
now
it
s
this
how
can
i
live
with
a
good
conscience
the
apostle
paul
often
talks
about
the
conscience
and
how
specifically
a
good
conscience
is
something
he
always
lived
with
apparently
even
before
he
became
a
christian
acts
231
2416
we
also
see
that
a
good
conscience
is
a
qualification
for
christian
leaders
1
timothy
39
and
having
a
good
conscience
is
an
important
goal
of
the
christian
life
for
all
believers
1
timothy

“
when
i
read
the
way
paul
uses
the
word
conscience
in
these
contexts
it
seems
like
he
s
saying
it
means
to
be
presently
walking
in
obedience
to
everything
god
has
revealed
to
him
he
does
not
seem
to
mean
that
he
s
for
forgiveness
according
to
1
john
18
–
10
and
matthew
612
“
all
this
means
that
i
literally
never
have
a
good
conscience
—
i
am
always
aware
of
important
ways
in
which
i
presently
need
to
repent
and
become
more
holy
so
if
a
good
conscience
is
a
basic
christian
issue
and
paul
always
had
one
yet
i
will
always
know
of
sin
areas
in
my
life
—
and
if
i
have
to
pray
daily
for
forgiveness
—
how
could
i
or
any
christian
for
that
matter
ever
attain
to
a
good
conscience
”
well
arnaldo
has
done
his
homework
he
laid
out
texts
in
that
question
i
feel
the
force
of
the
question
experientially
walking
in
a
good
conscience
is
not
easy
for
me
since
i
share
arnaldo
s
deep
awareness
of
my
ongoing
indwelling
sin
that
s
paul

term
in

we
all
have
remaining
corruption
and
indwelling
sin
the
more
keenly
you
are
aware
of
that
the
more
you
will
feel
embattled
at
the
level
of
needing
a
good
conscience
“
the
whole
new
testament
does
assume
that
in
this
life
nobody
attains
to
the
publican
who
said
“
god
be
merciful
to
me
a
sinner
”
over
against
the
pharisee
who
was
thanking
god
that
he
had
such
a
clear
conscience

and
he
said
that

one
who
cried
out
for
mercy
about
his
sin
went
down

it
was
good
for
him
to
own
his
sinfulness
not
to
say
“
oh
it
doesn
t
exist
i
ve
got
a
clear
conscience
i
don
t
have
any
sin
to
repent
of
”
we
feel
the
force
now
i
think
1
john

is
not
only
especially
illuminating
but
gives
us
a
category
alongside
good
conscience
that
may
provide
the
solution
walking
in
the
light
cleansing
and
forgiveness
“
a
good
conscience
is
virtually
the
same
as
walking
in
the
light
”
here
s
what
i
would
draw
from
this
if
i
use
the
category
of
conscience
to
explain
this
passage
a
good
conscience
is
virtually
the
same
as
walking
in
the
light
christians
should
be
able
to
say
“
i
m
walking
in
the
light
”
and
mean
it
and
mean
by
that
“
i
m
walking
in
a
good
conscience
”
which
means
i
don
t
think
we
should
equate
having
a
bad
conscience
with
having
indwelling
sin
now
that
may
be
the
most
important
thing
i
say
tony
let
me
say
it
again
i
m
inferring
from
what
i
ve
said
from
1
john
1
that
having
a
bad
conscience
is
not
the
same
as
having
indwelling
sin
they
re
not
the
same
our
clear
conscience
that
s
my
basic
answer
to
arnaldo
s
question
he
feels
that
as
long
as
he
is
aware
of
the
reality
of
indwelling
sin
as
in
romans
7
he
cannot
have
a
good
conscience
now
if
that
were
true
i
don
t
think
paul
could
ever
have
a
good
conscience
but
he
clearly
says
he
does
have
a
good
conscience
“
i
thank
god
whom
i
serve
as
did
my
ancestors
with
a
clear
conscience
”
2
timothy
13
he
expects
the
elders
of
the
church
to
do
the
same
“
they
must
hold
the
mystery
of
the
faith
with
a
clear
conscience
”
1
timothy
39
that
s
the
goal
for
all
christians
according
to
1
timothy
15
“
the
aim
of
our
charge
is
love
that
issues
from
a
pure
heart
and
a
good
conscience
and
a
sincere
faith
”
i
don
t
think
we
should
equate
a
good
conscience
with
sinless
perfection
in
this
life
nor
equate
a
bad
conscience
with
the
presence
of
indwelling
sin
or
remaining
corruption
rather
a
clear
or
a
good
conscience
is
like
walking
in
the
light
if
we
walk
in
the
light
as
he
is
in
the
light
we
have
fellowship
i
think
both
paul
and
john
inherited
this
concept
of
ongoing
indwelling
sin
that
nevertheless
coexists
with
a
good
conscience
from
the
psalms
in
the
old
testament
not
the
only
place
in
the
psalms
there
are
a
lot
of
psalms
that
distinguish
the
righteous
and
the
wicked
the
righteous
are
really
righteous
they
re
walking
in
the
light
they
have
a
good
conscience
in
david
s
mind
there
is
an
integrity
and
an
uprightness
that
is
aware
of
indwelling
corruption
that
breaks
out
at
times
in
sins
it
does
and
and
used
language
that
way
john
used
the
language
of
walking
in
the
light
though
we
are
imperfect
paul
used
the
language
of
walking
in
a
good
conscience
though
we
are
imperfect
i
think
for
all
of
them
david
paul
john
the
key
that
enabled
them
to
think
this
way
is
that
they
all
knew
god
had
made
a
way
for
all
their
sins
to
be
passed
over
—
i
do
think
arnaldo
is
right
to
say
that
justification
by
faith
is
not
the
same
as
walking
in
a
good
conscience
or
walking
in
the
light
or
having
integrity
those
are
real
character
traits
not
imputed
righteousness
nevertheless
it
s
the
covering
of
all
their
sins
by
the
blood
of
jesus
that
enables
them
to
look
upon
their
conscience
and
walking
and
integrity
with
thankfulness
and
confidence
that
it
really
will
be
accepted
by
god
as
good
though
imperfect
no
no
no
that
is
not
the
time
to
say
that
with
your
kids
listening
and
your
wife
listening
and
the
whole
church
wondering
what
you
need
to
say
at
that
moment
is
this
“
my
conscience
is
clear
i
am
a
man
of
integrity
i
have
walked
in
the
light
i
have
never
touched
that
woman
or
any
woman
sexually
besides
my
wife
this
accusation
is
not
true
”
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
implications
of
what
paul
is
saying
when
he
says
to
the
elders
and
to
the
rest
of
us
that
we
should
walk
in
a
good
conscience

would

if
you
stopped
to
doublecheck
if
conscience
or
conscious
was
actually
being
used
incorrectly
in
any
of
the
above
examples
this
article
will
help
you
to
readily
differentiate
the
words
and
use
them
with
confidence
in
the
future
—
since
honestly
there
were
no
trick
examples
and
if
wrongly
using
conscience
in
place
of
conscious
or
vice

has
never
been
on
your

and
an

it
s
our
moral
obligation
to

conscience
and

derive
from
the
same
latin
roots
—
the
prefix
com
with
together
jointly
and
the
verb
scire
to
know
and
the
combination
conscire
means
to
be
aware
of
guilt
—
and
both
relate
to
a
state
of
awareness
the
first
of
a
moral
awareness
and
the
second
of
a
physical
or
mental
wakefulness
in
which
a
person
is
aware
of
their
surroundings
english
speakers
are
first
made
aware
of
conscience
in
the
13th
century
and
conscious
in
the
16th
conscience
and
conscious
have
similar
pronunciations
which
for
some
causes
confusion
their
first
syllables
are
pronounced
the
same
and
they
both
contain
a
middle
sh
sound
for
those
who
hesitate
on
which
to
use
learning
the
words
suffixes
and
their
meanings
and
also
the
words
parts
of
speech
might
be
the
best
approach
in
differentiating
them
conscience
having
the
noun
suffix
ence
meaning
quality
or

is
well
a
noun
and
conscious
having
the
adjective
suffix
ous
meaning

what
does
conscience
mean
the
noun
conscience
refers
to
a
state
of
awareness
or
a
sense
that
one
s
actions
or
intentions
are
either
morally
right
or
wrong
along
with
a
feeling
of
obligation
to
do
the
right

hopefully
you
are
now
fully
or
at
least
semi
conscious
of
the
differences
in
using

and

—
the
most
essential
one
being
that
conscience
is
a
noun
and
conscious
is
an
adjective
which
describes
nouns
keep
in
mind
that
whenever
you
are
in
a
difficult
situation
you
should
be
conscious
about
what
your
conscience
is
telling
you
your
conscience
will
help
you
make
moral
just
and
fair
decisions

according

215
conscience
is
the
one
bearing

accusing

excusing

another
so
we

catholic
theology
sees
conscience
as
the
last
practical
judgment
of
reason
which
at
the
appropriate
moment
enjoins
a
person
to
do
good
and
to
avoid
evil
33
the
second
vatican
council
1962
–
65
describes
deep
within
his
conscience
man
discovers
a
law
which
he
has
not
laid
upon
himself
but
which
he
must
obey
its
voice
ever
calling
him
to
love
and
to
do
what
is
good
and
to
avoid
evil
tells
him
inwardly
at
the
right
movement
do
this
shun
that
for
man
has
in
his
heart
a
law
inscribed
by
god
his
dignity
lies
in
observing
this
law
and
by
it
he
will
be
judged
his
conscience
is
man
s
most
secret
core
and
his
sanctuary
there
he
is
alone
with
god
whose
voice
echoes
in
his
depths
34
thus
conscience
is
not
like
the
will
nor
a
habit
like
prudence
but
the
interior
space
in
which
we
can
listen
to
and
hear
the
truth
the
good
the
voice
of
god
it
is
the
inner
place
of
our
to
understand
the
path
we
ought
to
take
and
once
the
decision
is
made
to
move
forward
to
remain
faithful35
in
terms
of
logic
conscience
can
be
viewed
as
the
practical
conclusion
of
a
moral
syllogism
whose
major
premise
is
an
objective
norm
and
whose
minor
premise
is
a
particular
case
or
situation
to
which
the
norm
is
applied
thus
catholics
are
taught
to
carefully
educate
themselves
as
to
revealed
norms
and
norms
derived
therefrom
so
as
to
form
a
correct
conscience
catholics
are
also
to
examine
their
conscience
daily
and
with
special
care
before
confession
catholic
teaching
holds
that
man
has
the
right
to
act
according
to
his
conscience
and
in
freedom
so
as
personally
to
make
moral
decisions
he
must
not
be
forced
to
act
contrary
to
his
conscience
nor
must
he
be
prevented
from
acting
according
to
his
conscience
especially
in
religious
matters
36
this
right
of
conscience
does
not
allow
one
to
arbitrarily
disagree
with
church
teaching
and
claim
that
one
is
acting
in
accordance
with
conscience
a
sincere
conscience
presumes
one
is
diligently
seeking
moral
truth
from
authentic
sources
that
is
seeking
to
conform
oneself
to
that
moral
truth
by
listening
to
the
authority
established
by
christ
to
teach
it
nevertheless
despite
one
s
best
effort
it
can
happen
that
moral
conscience
remains
in
ignorance
and
makes
erroneous
judgments
about
acts
to
be
performed
or
already
committed
 
this
ignorance
can
often
be
imputed
to
personal
responsibility
 
in
such
cases
the
person
is
culpable
for
the
wrong
he
commits
37
thus
if
one
realizes
one
may
have
made
a
mistaken
judgment
one
s
conscience
is
said
to
be
vincibly
erroneous
and
it
is
not
a
valid
norm
for
action
one
must
first
remove
the
source
of
error
and
do
one
s
best
to
achieve
a
correct
judgment
if
however
one
is
not
aware
of
one
s
error
or
if
despite
an
honest
and
diligent
effort
one
cannot
remove
the
error
by
study
or
seeking
advice
then
one
s
conscience
may
be
said
to
be
invincibly
erroneous
it
binds
since
one
has
subjective
certainty
that
one
is
correct
the
act
resulting
from
acting
on
the
invincibly
erroneous
conscience
is
not
good
in
itself
yet
this
deformed
act
or
material
sin
against
god
s
right
order
and
the
objective
norm
is
not
imputed
to
the
person
the
formal
obedience
given
to
such
a
judgment
of
conscience
is
good
some
catholics
appeal
to
conscience
in
order
to
justify
dissent
not
on
the
level
of
conscience
properly
understood
but
on
the
level
of
the
principles
and
norms
which
are
supposed
to
inform
conscience
for
example
some
priests
make
on
the
use
of
the
socalled
internal
forum
solution
which
is
not
sanctioned
by
the
magisterium
to
justify
actions
rejection
of
the
church
s
authority
and
her
teaching
 
can
be
at
the
source
of
errors
in
judgment
in
moral
conduct
38
an
example

someone
following
his
conscience

the
point

accepting
the

being

wrote
on
the
distinction

two
aspects

who
saw
the
former
as
some
feeling

can

saying

is
that

brought
him
to
acknowledge

many
scholars
including

stated
that

as
a
personal
revelation
of
scriptural
truth
was
an
important
adjunct
to
the
talmudic
tradition

the
concept
of

freemasonry

itself
as
providing
an
adjunct
to

and
key
symbols
found
in

and
compasses
explained
as
providing
lessons
that

actions
by
the
square

to
circumscribe
their
desires
and
keep
their
passions

45
the
historian
manning
clark
viewed
conscience
as
one
of
the
comforters
that
religion
placed
between
man
and
death
but
also
a
crucial
part
of
the
quest
for
grace
encouraged
by
the
book
of

and
the
book
of
and
the
drive
for
social
power
of
religious
institutions
was
the
capacity
of
humans
to
reach
an
individual
spiritual
truth
through
reason
and
conscience
47
many
prominent
religious
works
about
conscience
also
have
a
significant
philosophical
component

55
the

martha
stout
terms
conscience
an

sense
of
obligation
based
in

56
thus
a
good
conscience
is
associated
with
feelings
of
integrity
psychological
wholeness
and
peacefulness
and
is
often
described
using
adjectives
such
as
quiet
clear
and
easy
57
sigmund
freud
regarded
conscience
as
originating
psychologically
from
the
growth
of
civilisation
which
periodically
frustrated
the
external
expression
of
aggression
this
destructive
impulse
being
forced
to
seek
against
the
person
s
own
ego
or
selfishness
often
taking
its
cue
in
this
regard
from
parents
during
childhood
58
according
to
freud
the
consequence
of
not
obeying
our
conscience
is
guilt
which
can
be
a
factor
in
the
development
of
neurosis
freud
claimed
that
both
the
cultural
and
individual
superego
set
up

in
humans
to
resolve
conflicts
between
competing
natural
impulsessome
about
selfpreservation
but
others
about
safety
of
a
family
or
community
the
claim
of
conscience
to
moral
authority
emerged
from
the
greater
duration
of
impression
of
social
instincts
in
the
struggle
for
survival
62
in
such
a
view
behavior
destructive
to
a
person
s
society
either
to
its
structures
or
to
the
persons
it
comprises
is
bad
or
evil
63
thus
conscience
can
be
viewed
as
an
outcome
of
those
biological
drives
that
prompt
humans
to
avoid
provoking
fear
or
contempt
in
others
being
experienced
as
guilt
and
shame
in
differing
ways
from
society

society
and

64
a
requirement
of
conscience
in
this
view

the
capacity
to
see
ourselves
from
the
point

another

persons
unable

therefore
often
act

66
fundamental
in
this
view
of
conscience
is
that
humans
consider
some
other
as
being
in
a
social
relationship
thus
nationalism
is
invoked
in
conscience
to
quell
tribal
conflict
and
the
notion
of
a
brotherhood
of
man
is
invoked
to
quell
national
conflicts

such
crowd
drives
may
not

overwhelm
but
redefine
individual
conscience

notes
that
the
accused
as
with
almost
all
his
fellow
germans
had
lost
track
of
his
conscience
to
the
point
where
they
hardly
remembered
it
this
wasn

caused
by
familiarity
with
atrocities
or
by
psychologically
redirecting
any
resultant
natural
pity
to
themselves
for
having
to
bear
such
an
unpleasant
duty
so
much
as
by
the
fact
that
anyone
whose
conscience
did
develop
doubts
could
see
no
one
who
shared
them
eichmann
did
not
need
to
close
his
ears
to
the
voice
of

not

sir
arthur
keith
in
1948
developed
the
amityenmity
complex
we
evolved
as
tribal
groups
surrounded
by
enemies
thus
conscience
evolved
a
dual
role
the
duty
to
save
and
protect
members
of
the
ingroup
and
the
duty
to
show
hatred
and
aggression
towards
any
outgroup
food
or
in

70
one
idea
is
that
as
people
or
animals
perceive
a
social
relationship
as
important
to
preserve
their
conscience
begins
to
respect
that
former
other
and
urge
actions
that
protect
it

the
word
conscience
derives
etymologically
from
the
latin
conscientia
meaning
privity
of
knowledge83

the
english
word
implies
internal
awareness
of
a
moral
standard
in
the
mind
concerning
the
quality
of
one
s
motives
as
well
as
a
consciousness
of
our
own
actions
84
thus
conscience
considered
philosophically
may
be
first
and
perhaps
most
commonly
a
largely
unexamined
gut
feeling
or
vague
sense
of
guilt
about
what
ought
to
be

85
conscience
in

is
not

the

of
a
process
of
rational
consideration
of
the
moral
features
of
a

or
the

is
accompanied
in

case
by
an
internal
awareness
of

believed
in

close
relationship
between

spiritual
integrity
and
physical
health
rather
than
being
selfindulgent
man
should
pursue
knowledge
use

his

that
it

that

communicates

this
the
flemish
mystic
jan
van
ruysbroeck
viewed
a
pure
conscience
as
facilitating
an
outflowing
losing
of
oneself
in
the
abyss
of
that
eternal
object
which
is
the
highest
and
chief
blessedness
some
medieval
christian
scholastics
such
as
bonaventure
made
a
distinction
between
conscience
as
a
rational
faculty
of
the
mind
practical
reason
and
inner
awareness
an
intuitive
spark
to
do
good
called
synderesis
arising
from
a
remnant
appreciation
of
absolute
good
becoming
a
source
of
inner
torment
89
early
modern
theologians
such
as
william
perkins
and
william
ames
developed
a
syllogistic
understanding
of
the
conscience
where
god
s
law
made
the
first
term
the
act
to
be
judged
the
second
and
the
action
of
the
conscience
as
a
rational
faculty
produced
the
judgement
by
debating

such
understanding

the
medieval
persian
philosopher
ibn
sina
avicenna
developed
a
sensory
deprivation
thought
experiment
to
explore
the
relationship
between
conscience
and
god
in
the
13th
century
st
thomas
aquinas
regarded
conscience
as
the
application
of
moral
knowledge
to
a
particular
case
s
t
i
q
79
a
13
thus
conscience
was
considered
an
act
or
judgment
of
practical
reason
that
began
with
synderesis
the
structured
development
of
our
innate
remnant
awareness
of
absolute
good
which
he
categorised
as
involving
the
five
primary
precepts
proposed
in
his
theory
of
natural
law
into
an
acquired
habit
of
applying
moral
principles
50
according
to
singer
aquinas
held
that
conscience
or
conscientia
was
an
imperfect
process
of
judgment
applied
to
activity
because
knowledge
of
the
natural
law
and
all
acts
of
natural
virtue
implicit
therein
was
obscured
in
most
people
by
education
and
custom
that
promoted
selfishness
rather
than
fellowfeeling
summa

94
aquinas
also
discussed
conscience
in
relation
to
the
virtue
of
prudence
to
explain
why
some
people
appear
to
be
less
morally
enlightened
than
others
their
weak
will
being
incapable
of
adequately
balancing
their
own
needs
with
those
of
others
95
aquinas
reasoned
that
acting
contrary
to
conscience
is
an
evil
action
but
an
errant
conscience
is
only
blameworthy
if
it
is
the
result
of
culpable
or
vincible
ignorance
of
factors
that
one
has
a
duty
to
have
knowledge
of
94
aquinas
also
argued
that
conscience
should
be
educated
to
act
towards
real
goods
from
god
which
encouraged
human
flourishing
rather
than
the
apparent
goods
of
sensory
pleasures
94
thomas
a
kempis
in
the
medieval
contemplative
classic
the
imitation
of
christ
ca
1418
stated
that
the
glory
of
a
good
man
is
the
witness
of
a
good
conscience
preserve
a
quiet
conscience
and
you
will
always
have
joy
a
quiet
conscience
can
endure
much
and
remains
joyful
in
all
trouble
but
an
evil
conscience
is
always
fearful
and
uneasy
97
the
anonymous
medieval
author
of
the
christian
mystical
work
the
cloud
of
unknowing
similarly
expressed
the
view
that
in
profound
and
prolonged
always
there
even
after
one
s
confession
and
however
busy
one
is
in
holy
things
therefore
whoever
would
work
at
becoming
a
contemplative
must
first
cleanse
his
or
her
conscience
98
the
medieval
flemish
mystic
john
of
ruysbroeck
likewise
held
that
true
conscience
has
four
aspects
that
are
necessary
to
render
a
man
just
in
the
active
and
contemplative
life
a
free
spirit
attracting
itself
through
love
an
schopenhauer
considered
that
the
good
conscience
we
experience
after
an
unselfish
act
verifies
that
our
true
self
exists
outside
our
physical
person
thought
produced
by
emotions
and
to
fall
in
love
with
viewing
problems
requiring
moral
decision
from
the
perspective
of
eternity
101
thus
living
a
life
of
peaceful
conscience
means
to
spinoza
that
reason
is
used
to
generate
adequate
ideas
where
the
mind
increasingly
sees
the
world
and
its
conflicts
our
desires
and
passions
sub
specie
aeternitatis
that
is
without
reference
to
time
102
hegel
s
obscure
and
mystical
philosophy
of
mind
held
that
the
absolute
right
of
freedom
of
conscience
facilitates
human
understanding
of
an
allembracing
unity
an
absolute
which
was
rational
real
and
true
103
nevertheless
hegel
thought
that
a
functioning
state
would
always
be
tempted
not
to
recognize
conscience
in
its
form
of
subjective
knowledge
just
as
similar
nonobjective
opinions
are
generally
rejected
in
science
104
a
similar
idealist
notion
was
expressed
in
the
writings
of
joseph
butler
who
argued
that
conscience
is
godgiven
should
always
be
obeyed
is
intuitive
and
should
be
considered
the
constitutional
monarch
and
the
universal
moral
faculty
conscience
does
not
only
offer
itself
to
show
us
the
way
we
should
walk
in
but
it
likewise
carries
its
own
authority
with
it
105
butler
advanced
ethical
speculation
by
referring
to
a
duality
of
regulative
principles
in
human
nature
first
selflove
seeking
individual
happiness
and
second
benevolence
compassion
and
seeking
good
for
another
in
conscience
also
linked
to
the
agape
of
situational
ethics
51
conscience
tended
to
be
more
authoritative
in
questions
of
moral
judgment
thought
butler
because
it
was
more
likely
to
be
clear
and
certain
whereas
calculations
of
selfinterest
tended
to
probable
and
changing
conclusions
106
john
selden
in
his
table
talk
expressed
the
view
that
an
awake
but
excessively
scrupulous
or
illtrained
conscience
could
hinder
resolve
and
practical
action
it
being
like
a
horse
that
is
not
well
wayed
he
starts
at
every
bird
that
flies
out
of
the
available
in
german
translations
in
the
18th
and
19th
centuries
they
influenced
philosophers
such
as
schopenhauer
to
hold
that
in
a
healthy
mind
only
deeds
oppress
our
conscience
not
wishes
and
thoughts
for
it
is
only
our
deeds
that
hold
us
up
to
the
mirror
of
our
will
the
good
conscience
thought
schopenhauer
we
experience
after
every
disinterested
deed
arises
from
direct
recognition
of
our
own
inner
being
in
the
phenomenon
of
another
it
affords
us
the
verification
that
our
here
is
kant
s
categorical
imperative
act
only
according
to
that
maxim
by
which
you
can
at
the
same
time
will
that
it
should
become
a
universal
law
110
kant
considered
critical
conscience
to
be
an
internal
court
in
which
our
thoughts
accuse
or
excuse
one
another
he
acknowledged
that
morally
mature
people
do
often
describe
contentment
or
peace
in
the
soul
after
following
conscience
to
perform
a
duty
but
argued
that
for
such
acts
to
produce
virtue
their
primary
motivation
should
simply
be
duty
not
expectation
of
any
such
bliss
111
rousseau
expressed
a
similar
view
that
conscience
somehow
connected
man
to
a
greater
metaphysical
unity
john
plamenatz
in
his
critical
examination
of
rousseau
s
work
considered
that
conscience
was
there
defined
as
the
feeling
that
urges
us
in
spite
of
contrary
passions
towards
two
harmonies
the
one
within
our
minds
and
between

viewed
the
widespread
social
fact
of
conscience
as
a
justification
for

rights
adam
smith
conscience
shows
what
relates
to
ourselves
in
its
proper
shape
and
dimensions
samuel
johnson
1775
stated
that
no
man
s
conscience
can
tell
him
the
right
of
another
man
other
philosophers
expressed
a
more
sceptical
and
pragmatic
view
of
the
operation
of
conscience
in
society
113
john
locke
in
his
essays
on
the
law
of
nature
argued
that
the
widespread
fact
of
human
conscience
allowed
a
philosopher
to
infer
the
necessary
existence
of
objective
moral
laws
that
occasionally
might
contradict
those
of
the
state
114
locke
highlighted
the
metaethics
problem
of
whether
accepting
a
statement
like
follow
your
conscience
supports
subjectivist
or
objectivist
conceptions
of
conscience
as
a
guide
in
concrete
morality
or
as
a
spontaneous
revelation
of
eternal
and
immutable
principles
to
the
individual
if
conscience
be
a
proof
of
innate
principles
contraries
may
be
innate
principles
since
some
men
with
the
same
bent
of
conscience
prosecute
what
others
avoid
115
thomas
hobbes
likewise
pragmatically
noted
that
opinions
formed
on
the
basis
of
conscience
with
full
and
honest
conviction
nevertheless
should
always
be
accepted
with
humility
as
potentially
erroneous
and
not
necessarily
indicating
absolute
knowledge
or
truth
116
william
godwin
expressed
the
view
that
conscience
was
a
memorable
consequence
of
the
perception
by
men
of
every
creed
when
the
descend
into
the
scene
of
busy
life
that
they
possess
free
will
117
adam
smith
considered
that
it
was
only
by
developing
a
critical
conscience
that
we
can
ever
see
what
relates
to
ourselves
in
its
proper
shape
and
dimensions
or
that
we
can
ever
make
any
proper
comparison
between
our
own
interests
and
those
of
other
people
118
john
stuart
mill
believed
that
idealism
about
the
role
of
conscience
in
government
should
be
tempered
with
a
practical
realisation
that
few
men
in
society
are
capable
of
directing
their
minds
or
purposes
towards
distant
or
unobvious
comes
after
them
for
the
idea
of
posterity
of
their
country
or
of
humanity
whether
grounded
on
sympathy
or
on
a
conscientious
feeling
119
mill
held
that
certain
amount
of
conscience
and
of
disinterested
public
spirit
may
fairly
be
calculated
on
in
the
citizens
of
any
community
ripe
for
representative
government
but
that
it
would
josiah
royce
1855
–
1916
built
on
the
transcendental
idealism
view
of
conscience
viewing
it
as
the
ideal
of
life
which
constitutes
our
moral
personality
our
plan
of
being
ourself
of
making
common
sense
ethical
decisions
but
he
thought
this
was
only
true
insofar
as
our
conscience
also
required
loyalty
to
a
mysterious
higher
or
deeper
self
120
in
the
modern
christian
tradition
this
approach
achieved
expression
with
dietrich
bonhoeffer
who
stated
during
his
imprisonment
by
the
nazis
in
world
war
ii
that
conscience
for
him
was
more
than
practical
reason
indeed
it
came
from
a
depth
which
lies
beyond
a
man
s
own
will
and
his
own
reason
and
it
makes
itself
heard
as
the
call
of
human
existence
to
unity
with
itself
121
for
bonhoeffer
a
guilty
conscience
arose
as
an
indictment
of
the
loss
of
this
unity
and
as
a
warning
against
the
loss
of
one
s
self
primarily
he
thought
it
is
directed
not
towards
a
particular
kind
of
doing
but
towards
a
particular
mode
of
being
it
protests
against
a
doing
which
imperils
the
unity
of
this
being
with
itself
52
conscience
for
bonhoeffer
did
not
like
shame
embrace
or
pass
judgment
on
the
morality
of
the
whole
of
its
owner
s
life
it
reacted
only
to
certain
definite
actions
it
recalls
what
is
long
past
and
represents
this
disunion
as
something
which
is
already
accomplished
and
irreparable
122
the
man
with
a
conscience
he
believed
fights
a
lonely
battle
against
the
overwhelming
forces
of
inescapable
situations
which
demand
moral
decisions
despite
the
likelihood
of
that
the
truth
distributed
in
the
world
as
the
statement
about
human
dignity
as
the
affirmation
of
the
line
between
good
and
evil
lives
in
people
as
conscience
123
as
hannah
arendt
pointed
out
however
following
the
utilitarian
john
stuart
mill
on
this
point
a
bad
conscience
does
not
necessarily
signify
a
bad
character
in
fact
only
those
who
affirm
a
commitment
to
applying
moral
standards
will
be
troubled
with
remorse
guilt
or
shame
by
a
bad
conscience
and
their
need
to
regain
integrity
and
wholeness
of
the
self
124125
representing
our
soul
or
true
self
by
analogy
as
our
house
arendt
wrote
that
conscience
is
the
anticipation
of
the
fellow
who
awaits
you
if
and
when
you
come
home
126
arendt
believed
that
people
who
are
unfamiliar
with
the
process
of
silent
count
on
its
being
forgotten
the
next
moment
bad
people
are
not
full
of
regrets
126
arendt
also
wrote
eloquently
on
the
problem
of
languages
distinguishing
the
word
consciousness
from
conscience
one
reason
she
held
was
that
conscience
as
we
understand
it
in
moral
or
legal
matters
is
supposedly
always
present
within
us
just
like
consciousness
and
this
conscience
is
also
supposed
to
tell
us
what
to
do
and
what
to
repent
before
it
became
the
lumen
naturale
or
kant
s
practical
reason
it
was
the
voice
of

127
albert
einstein
associated
conscience
with
suprapersonal
thoughts
feelings
and
aspirations
albert
einstein
as
a
selfprofessed
adherent
of
humanism
and
rationalism
likewise
viewed
an
enlightened
religious
person
as
one
whose
conscience
reflects
that
he
has
to
the
best
of
his
ability
liberated
himself
from
the
fetters
of
his
selfish
desires
and
is
preoccupied
with
thoughts

and
aspirations
to
which
he
clings
liberty
obligations
should
take
precedence
over
rights
in
moral
and
political
philosophy
and
a
spiritual
awakening
should
occur
in
the
conscience
of
most
citizens
so
that
social
obligations
are
viewed
as
fundamentally
having
a
transcendent
origin
and
a
beneficent

arose
from
realist
and
materialist
perspectives
such
as
those
of
charles
darwin
darwin
suggested
that
any
animal
whatever
endowed
with
wellmarked
social
instincts
the
parental
and
filial
affections
being
here
included
would
inevitably
acquire
a
moral
sense
or
conscience
as
soon
as
its
intellectual
powers
had
become
as
well
or
as
nearly
as
well
developed
as
in
man
133
émile
durkheim
held
that
the
soul
and
conscience
were
particular
forms
of
an
impersonal
principle
diffused
in
the
relevant
group
and
communicated
by
totemic
ceremonies
134
a
j
ayer
was
a
more
recent
realist
who
held
that
the
existence
of
conscience
was
an
empirical
question
to
be
answered
by
sociological
research
into
the
moral
habits
of
a
given
person
or
group
of
people
and
what
causes
believed
fell
wholly
within
the
scope
of
the
existing
social
sciences
135
george
edward
moore
bridged
the
idealistic
and
sociological
views
of
critical
and
traditional
conscience
in
stating
that
the
idea
of
abstract
rightness
and
the
various
degrees
of
the
specific
emotion
excited
by
it
are
what
constitute
for
many
persons
the
specifically
moral
sentiment
or
conscience
for
others
however
an
action
seems
to
be
properly
termed
internally
right
merely
because
they
have
previously
regarded
it
as
right

137
michael
walzer
claimed
that
the
growth
of
religious
toleration
in
western
nations
arose
amongst
other
things
from
the
general
recognition
that
private
conscience
signified
some
inner
divine
presence
regardless
of
the
religious
faith
professed
and
from
the
general
respectability
piety
selflimitation
and
sectarian
discipline
which
marked
most
of
the
men
who
claimed
the
rights
of
conscience
138
walzer
also
argued
that
attempts
by
courts
to
define
conscience
as
a
merely
personal
moral
code
or
as
sincere
belief
risked
encouraging
an
anarchy
of
moral
egotisms
unless
such
a
code
and
motive
was
necessarily
tempered
with
individual
to
a
universal
spiritual
order
or
from
the
common
principles
and
mutual
engagements
of
unselfish
people
139
ronald
dworkin
maintains
that
constitutional
protection
of
freedom
of
conscience
is
central
to
democracy
but
creates
personal
duties
to
live
up
to
it
freedom
of
conscience
presupposes
a
personal
responsibility
of
reflection
and
it
loses
much
of
its
meaning
when
that
responsibility
is
ignored
a
good
life
need
not
be
an
especially
reflective
one
most
of
because
it
forfeits
dignity
for
ease
140
edward
conze
stated
it
is
important
for
individual
and
collective
moral
growth
that
we
recognise
the
illusion
of
our
conscience
being
wholly
located
in
our
body
indeed
both
our
conscience
and
wisdom
expand
when
we
act
in
an
unselfish
way
and
conversely
repressed
compassion
results
in
an
unconscious
sense
of
guilt
141
peter
singer
distinguished
between
immature
traditional
and
highly
reasoned
critical
conscience
the
philosopher
peter
singer
considers
that
usually
when
we
describe
an
moral
antirealists
debate
whether
the
moral
facts
necessary
to
activate
conscience
supervene
on
natural
facts
with
a
posteriori
necessity
or
arise
a
priori
because
moral
facts
have
a
primary
intension
and
naturally
identical
worlds
may
be
presumed

identical
143
it
has
also
been
argued
that
there
is
a
measure
of
moral
luck
in
how
circumstances
create
the
obstacles
which
conscience
must
overcome
to
apply
moral
principles
or
human
rights
and
that
with
the
benefit
of
enforceable
property
rights
and
the
rule
of

to
universal
conditions
such
as
malaria

hivaids
and

people
in

prosperous
developed
countries
have
been
spared

of
conscience
associated
with
the
physical
necessity
to
steal
scraps
of

bribe
tax
inspectors
or
police
officers
and
commit
murder
in
guerrilla
wars
against
corrupt
government
forces
or

144
roger
scruton
has
claimed
that
true
understanding
of
conscience
and
its
relationship
with
morality
has
been
hampered
by
an
impetuous
belief
that
philosophical
questions
are
solved
through
the
analysis
of
language
in
an
area
where
clarity
threatens

wrote
that
most
of

do
not

likely
shaped
not
so
much
by

garrett
hardin
in
a
famous
article
called
the

of

commons
argues
that
any
instance
in
which
society
appeals
to

exploiting
a
commons
to
restrain
himself
or
herself
for
the
general
good
—
by

john

expressed
the
view
in
the
unconscious
civilization
that
in
contemporary
developed
nations
many
people
have
acquiesced
in
turning
over
their
sense
of

their
critical
conscience
to
technical
experts
willingly
restricting
their
moral
freedom
of

to

by
the
ideology
of

some
argue
on
religious
or
philosophical
grounds
that
it
is
blameworthy
to
act
against
conscience
even
if
the
judgement
of
conscience
is
likely
to
be
erroneous
say
because
it
is
inadequately
informed
about
the
facts
or
prevailing

or

and
human

norms
151
failure
to
acknowledge
and
accept
that
conscientious
judgements
can
be
seriously
mistaken
may
only
promote
situations
where
one
s
conscience
is
manipulated
by
others
to
provide
unwarranted
justifications
for
nonvirtuous
and
selfish
acts
indeed
insofar
as
it
is
appealed
to
as
glorifying
ideological
content
and
an
associated
extreme
level
of
devotion
without
adequate
constraint
of
external
altruistic
normative
justification
conscience
may
be
considered
morally
blind

emmanuel
levinas
viewed
conscience
as
a
revelatory
encountering
of
resistance
to
our
selfish
powers
developing
morality
by
calling
into
question
our
naive
sense
of
freedom
being
more
severe
the
more
rigorously
the
goal
of
our
self
was
to
obtain
control
153
in
other
words
the
welcoming
of
the
other
to
levinas
was
the
very
essence
of
conscience
properly
conceived
it
encouraged
our
ego
to
accept
the
fallibility
of
assuming
things
about
other
people
that
selfish
freedom
of
will
does
not
have
the
last
word
and
that
realising
this
has
a
transcendent
purpose

a

was

contended
with

one
of
the
goals
of
preachingteaching
the
word
of
god
is
a
“
good
conscience
”
our
conscience
is
designed
to
help
guide
us
to
do
what
is
right
“
right
”
depends
on
how
it
is
trained
if
we
want
to
accomplish
this
goal
we
need
to
understand
more
about
the
conscience
there
are
at
least
six
different
types
of
conscience
addressed
in
the
new
testament
we
will
consider
them
here
good
conscience
a
 
good
conscience
is
one
which
is
free
from
guilt
–
we
are
doing
what
we
believe
to
be
right
used
two
different
ways
in
the
nt
of
those
who
did
right
and
those
who
did
wrong
those
who
do
right
are
to
have
a
 
good
conscience
1

defiled
conscience
a
 
defiled
conscience
is
one
which
causes
one
to
feel
guilt
for
doing
what
is
either
right
or
innocent
–
 
right
is
something
required
by
god
2
timothy

innocent
is
not
right
or
wrong

itself
romans
1423
in

some
had
a
 
defiled
conscience
1
corinthians
87
–
much
of
the
meat
sold
in
the
markets
in
corinth
had
been
used
previously
in
idol
worship
paul
explained
that
buyingeating

however
those
“
accustomed
to
the
idol
”
could
not
separate
the
idol
worship
from
eating
1
corinthians
87
–
for
them
to
eat
would
violate
their
conscience
and
embolden
them
to
sin
1
corinthians
81011
cf
romans
1423
if
one
has
a

they

the
truth

cf
acts
1826
seared
conscience
a
 
seared
conscience
is
one
that
no
longer
feels
guilt
for
sin
–
whether
one
followed
the
right
or
wrong
standard
it
is
a
conscience
that
has
been
violated
so
many
times
that
it
no
longer
works

spirit

of
those
who
would
fall

a
 
weak
conscience
is
one
that
has
simply
not
been
trained
in
what
is
right
–
lacks
knowledge
from
god
that
provides

hebrews
1022
is
the
only
verse
in
the
bible
that
directly
refers
to
an
“
evil
conscience
”
however
as
previously
pointed
out
the
bible
abounds
with
stark
nuances
of
both
forms
of
a
good
or
evil
conscience
it
is
impossible
to
speak
about
specific
evil
consciences
without
juxtaposing
them
with
their
corresponding
good
conscience
as
we
have
seen
in
the
preceding
studies
a
good
conscience
is
dramatically
differentiated
by
adam
and
eve
partaking
of
the
tree
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
subsequently
a
pandora
s
box
of
evil
conscience
blooms
like
leavening
in
bread
dough
as
such
mr
barid
s
order
of
sixteen
headings
for
his
conscience
study
does
not
descend
in
order
of
authority
but
rather
it
is
in
order

scriptural
reference

our
study
today
is
on
an
“
evil
conscience
”
yet
when
we
review
the
above
headings
the
vast
majority
of
them
are
all
aspects
of
an
evil
conscience
nonetheless
it
is
the
saint
s
godgiven
passion
to
study
every
detail
of
his
word
leaving
nothing
alive
that
breathes
of
misunderstanding
and
thus
our
continuation
of
the
sixteen
mostly
evil
versions
of
our
conscience
clearly
adam
and
cain
within
us
initiated
the
many
forms
of
evil
consciences
yet
the
first
time
the
term
is
directly
used
is
in
hebrews
1022
the
entire
bible
bleeding
defiled
evil
consciences
from
the
beginning
to
near
the
end
hebrews
10
admonishes
us
to
remain
faithful
to
the
new
covenant
in
christ
and
not
regress
to
the
laws
of
moses
so
etched
in
our
hearts
that
we
temporarily
battle
a
dual
of
tortured
consciences
as
paul
did
regarding
circumcision
heb
1020
 
by
a
new
and
living
way
one
that
literally
leads
to
life
eternal
which
he
hath
consecrated
for
us
through
the
veil
that
is
to
say
his
flesh
revealing
the
path
to
a
more
excellent
conscience
heb
1021
 
and
having
an
high
priest
over
the
house
of
god
heb
1022
 
let
us
draw
near
with
a
true
heart
in
full
assurance
of
faith
having
our
hearts
sprinkled
a
sprinkle
little
by
little
is
the
beginning
of
a
storm
a
flood
of
truth
from
an
evil
conscience
and
our
bodies
washed
with
pure
water
heb
1023
 
let
us
hold
fast
the
new
profession
of
our
faith
without
spirit
and
in
truth
formally
israel
worshiped
god
by
attempting
to
keep
his
laws
through
physical
washings
and
sacrifices
that
most
certainly
caused
his
people
a
good
conscience
via
those
laws
yet
as
depicted
by
saul
who
became
paul
his
pricked
conscience
while
under
the
slavery
of
the
old
covenant
was
subliminally
aware
of
a
strange
new
conscience
opposing
most
turbulently
his
established
beliefs
paul
s
boldness
became
dramatically
evident
through
his
earthquake
of
miraculous
blindness
as
he
whimpered
”
who
art
thou
lord
”
and
the
against
the
pricks
acts
9
paul
s
conscience
was
kicking
against
the
pricks
of
his
murderous
ways
and
imploring
eyes
staring
back
at
him
upon
his
many
stonings
as
he
demanded
the
church
of
the
day
adhere
to
moses
s
laws
subliminally
he
worship
of
god
by
the
same
laws
only
by
spirit
and
not
by
sweat
it
was
a
shift
in
how
each
of
us
now
perceived
what
constituted
an
evil
conscience
and
was
earthshattering
that
seismic
shift
in
how
to
live
by
the
law
was
quickly
realized
to
be
immensely
liberating
its
overpowering
joy
eclipsed
martyrdom
as
steven
exemplified
in
acts
7
tribe
moses
spake
nothing
concerning
priesthood
unlike
paul
moses
wasn
t
given
or
ready
to
have
his
conscience
pricked
by
a
better
conscience
by
the
holy
spirit
heb
715
 
and
it
is
yet
far
more
evident
for
that
after
the
unchangeable
priesthood
governed
by
a
pure
conscience
 
heb
725
 
wherefore
he
is
able
also
to
save
them
to
the
uttermost
that
them
heb
726
 
for
such
an
high
priest
became
us
who
is
holy
harmless
a
pure
conscience
casts
out
all
fear
undefiled
separate
from
sinners
and
made
higher
than
the
heavens
 
heb
727
 
who
needeth
not
daily
as
those
high
priests
to
offer
up
is
consecrated
for
evermore
 
hebrews

highlights
the
most
profound
shift
of
a
good
conscience
to
a
means
to
attain
a
pure
conscience
through
christ
our
high
priest
stephen
was
so
committed
to
the
spirit
of
a
good
conscience
of
greater
purity
that
he
was
willing
to
be
martyred
stephen
christ
and
all
the
martyrs
of
old
all
died
having
acted
in
good
faith
in
accordance
with
their
consciences
defying
an
evil
conscience
and
so
too
does
the
bride
of
christ
from
that
foundation
arises
the
focus
of
this
study
and
our
immovable
confidence

and
comparably
a
good
conscience
without
knowing
an
evil
conscience
let
s
review
some
everyday
examples
of
us
being
assailed
by
an
evil
conscience
namely
the
seemingly
imperishable
lust
of
the
eyes
the
lust
of
the
flesh
and
the
pride
of
life
in
the
old
covenant
an
evil
conscience
was
somewhat
foreign
to
lust
yet
still
pricked
their
consciences
mat

he
christ
saith
unto
them
the
apostles
moses
because
of
adultery
 
wow
what
an
indictment
of
a
good
conscience
that
mankind
subliminally
from
the
beginning
as
did
adam
eve
and
cain
at
heart
knew
by
their
subsequent
actions
of
hiding
revealed
an
evil
heart
against
what
constituted
a
good
conscience

ye
have
heard
that
it
was
said
by
them
of

time

in
matthew

christ
is
instituting
the
spirit
of
keeping
all
his
commandments
resulting
in
growing
a
perfect
conscience
as
he
and
the
father
perpetually
exist
without
contrast
yet
like
cain
and
paul
their
consciences
beheld
a
shadowy
dichotomy
of
a
pricked
conscience
suggesting
something
spiritually
awry
with
that
same
conscience
solomon
who
is
who
we
are
before
knowing
christ
withheld
from
himself
no
lust
as
seen
in
ecclesiastes
210
solomon
and
everyone
under
the
old
covenant
were
blessed
materially
for
their
lawful
dedication
to
loving
god
their
physical
wealth
denoted
their
love
for
god
in
a
shadowy
good
conscience
and
was
evidence
of
their
righteous
living
a
blessing
and
a
curse
deu
1127
 
a
blessing
if
ye
obey
the
commandments
of
the
lord
your
god
which
i
command
you
this
day
and
resulting
good
conscience
deu
1128
 
and
a
curse
if
ye
will
not
obey
the
commandments
of
the
lord
your
god
and
resulting
evil
conscience
but
turn
aside
out
of
the
way
which
i
command
you
this
day
to
go
after
other
gods
which
ye
have
not
known
and
assuredly
a
resulting
evil
conscience
as
earlier
expressed
much
later
achan
under
those
commandments
 
knew
by
his
evil
conscience
that
he
had
done
wrong
since
he
hid
his
treasure
in
the
ground
beneath
his
tent
the
spirit
of
keeping
the
lord
s
commands
was
already
evident
by
the
conviction
of
their
old
covenant
hearts
jesus
being
flesh
lived
in
perfectly
good
conscience
yet
he
knew
that
he
was
subject
to
an
evil
conscience
by
virtue
of
being
tempted
to
acquiesce
with
an
evil
conscience
in
submitting
to
the
devil
s
wiles
evil
was
present
within
his
flesh
as
it
is
in
us
yet
he
didn
t
sin
but
we
do
none
good
but
one
that
is
god
we
all
as
solomon
if
given
to
honestly
study
our
consciences
would
conclude
that
our
lusts
are
vanity
a
vapour
of
joy
unable
to
be
retained
solomon
came
close
to
understanding
the
misty
conclusion
of
his
polarised
conscience
confusing
him
while
he
did
his
best
to
live
by
the
laws
of
moses
and
yet
knew
some
unidentifiable
spirit
couldn
t
be
grasped
that
missing
something
was
the
unheardof
holy
spirit
that
urges
a
pure
conscience
that
later
in
his
experiences
with
the
shulamite
he
frustratingly
continued
to
see
blackness
christ
s
love
isn
t
awakened
in
solomon
and
the
world
until
he
pleases
in
the
life
s
experiences
only
produced
struggles
against
sin
to
be
always
faced
with
the
junction
of
choosing
by
our
lord
s
hand
a
pathway
of
either
a
good
or
evil
conscience
ecc
114
 
i
have
seen
all
the
works
that
are
done
under
the
sun
and
our
works
always
cause
us
to
constantly
be
vexed
by
having
to
choose
the
route
of
a
good
or
evil
conscience
 
ecc
115
 
that
which
is
crooked
cannot
be
made
straight
and
that
we
are
constantly
besieged
by
the
choice
of
a
good
or
evil
pathway
of
conscience
 
pro
218
 
the
way
of
him
that
is
laden
with
guilt
is
exceeding
crooked
but
as
for
the
pure
conscience
his
work
is
right
ecc
116
 
i
communed
with
mine
own
heart
my
conscience
saying
lo
i
am
come
to
great
estate
and
have
gotten
more
wisdom
than
all
they
that
have
been
before
me
in
jerusalem
yea
my
heart
had
great
knowledge
increaseth
sorrow
 
without
the
holy
spirit
to
prick
our
consciences
when
in
babylon
we
as
did
solomon
experienced
an
indefinable
sorrow
where
immense
physical
prosperity
and
wives
churches
eluded
our
quest
for
peace
and
perfect
joy
always
searching
but
never
coming
to
the
truth
our
dichotic
consciences
increased
sorrow
ecc

so
i
was
great
and
increased
more
than
all
that
were
before
labour
and
this
was
my
portion
of
all
my
labour
there
is
some
truth
that
in
good
conscience
particularly
solomon
in
his
time
and
remnants
of
us
in
babylon
believe
that
it
is
our
right
to
pursue
any
joy
of
the
flesh
as
long
as
we
use
our
“
wisdom
”
to
not

an
elusive
shulamitelike
epiphany
solomon
was
further
vexed
by
his
conscience
with
classic
introspection

says
 
ecc
211
 
then
i
looked
on
all
the
works
that
my
hands
had
wrought
how
utterly
frustrating
it
is
in
babylon
when
a
mist
of
christ
s
spirit
for
the
most
part
veils
our
conscience
when
given
a
stephenlike
revelation
upon
keeping
all
the
commandments
of
god
a
good
conscience
hailstones

understanding
washing
away
the
multitude
of
lies

outshining
all
vexations
of

us
with

doctrines

not
understanding
that
they
all
represent
the
same
ruling
deception
a
man

wife
mirrors
himself
as
having
a
heart

ensnares

said
“
a

cope
with
than

”
 
why
because
a
bad
conscience
is
mostly
contrived
in
secret
whereas
a
bad
reputation
is
humiliating
and
mostly
for
everyone
to
see
we
are
more
likely
to
fear
another
s
condemnation
rather
than
god
s
since
god
seems
far
off
and
not
in
our
faces
it
is
easier
in
the
short
term
to
hide
a
bad
reputation
even
with
having
to
live
with
the
amplification
of
an
evil
conscience
forever

let
s
now
look
at
customary
definitions

to
illustrate
how
they
stop
short
of

for
the
many
ambiguities

often
found
in

for

what

at

the
literature
online
relating
particularly
to
the
oxymoronic
concept
of
an
evil
conscience
emanates
mostly
from
theology
—
and
we
ll
deal
with
this
orientation
first
the
approach
that
fundamentalist
religion
takes
toward
ethics
is
absolutist
placing
a
person
s
behavior
into
neat
all
of
its
supporting
evidence
from
scriptures
greg
stuckey
defines
any
human
wrongdoing
as
—
purely
and
simply
—
evil
so
anyone
afflicted
with
such
a
presumed
immoral
conscience
will
experience
as
good
what
the
bible
delineates
as
evil
and
vice
versa
precisely
what
they
should
be
ashamed
of
rather
than
feeling
troubled
by
hurting
others
they
perversely
take
joy
in
it
looked
at
from
this
dogmatic
ecclesiastical
stance
an
evil
conscience
is
synonymous
with
sinning
against
god
—
and
it
requires
paying

“
let
us
draw
near
with
a
sincere
heart
in
full
assurance
of

having
our
hearts
sprinkled
clean
from

how
could
this
be
a
conscience
that
is
evil
the
traditionalists
are
going
to
faint
when
they
hear
about
this
could
it
be
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
conscience
that
directs
man
to
do
what
is
evil
instead
of
what
is
good
absolutely
just
as
it
is
possible
to
have
a
broken
compass
that
points
east
instead
of
north

about
sodom
and
gomorrah
do
you
think
those
guys
were
interested
in
doing
what
was
right
based
on
their
conscience
they
were
only
interested
in
sex
with
any
man
or
woman
they
could
find
don
t
be
surprised
this
is
what
the
heart
mind
and
conscience
of
man
can
degenerate
into
 
the
conscience
of
man
can
be
such
that
instead
of
leading
you
to
do
what
is
right
it
leads
you
to
do
what
is
evil
again
like
the
seared
conscience
you
can
either
develop
an
evil
conscience
or
be
born
with
it
the
difference
between
the
seared
and
evil
conscience
is
that
a
seared
conscience
is
devoid
of
guilt
or
without
regret
from
doing
what
is
wrong
or
the
conscience
itself
is
silent
an
evil
conscience
however
directs
the
heart
of
man
towards
evil
instead
of
good
doing
the
opposite
of
what
a
normal
functioning
conscience
would
do
 
in
theory
a
good
conscience
keeps
us
from
doing
wrong
because
it
is
a
voice
within
that
directs
us
towards
the
right
action
an
evil
conscience
desires
for
us
to
do
what
is
wrong
constantly
and
because
of
this
desire
there
is
no
guilt
associated
with
committing
whatever
evil
deed
your
heart
desires
 
you
would
be
surprised
to
hear
that
such
a
conscience
is
actually
quite
prevalent
in
the
church
because
it
is
easy
to
do
evil
and
still
walk
into
the
assembly
like
there
is
nothing
wrong
this
is
popular
at
highly

if

you
must

the

of
what
your

tells
you
to
do
it
is
as
simple
as
that
if
your
conscience
is
evil
it
is
pulling
you
towards
evil
action
so
you
must
resist
your
conscience
and
oppose
it
in

to
do
what
is
right
again
it
does
not
matter
if
you
feel
like
doing
what

if
you
want
to
or
what

it
only
matters
if
you
do

conscience
describes
two
things
–
what
a
person
believes
is
right
and
how
a
person
decides
what
is
right
more
than
just
gut
instinct
our
conscience
is
a
moral
muscle
by
informing
us
of
our
 
values
and
principles
it
becomes
the
standard
we
this
is
our
ability
to
recognise
ethical
values
and
principles
the
medieval
philosopher
 
thomas
aquinas
 
believed
our
conscience
emerged
from
 
synderesis
the
spark
of
conscience
he
literally
meant
the
human
mind
s
ability
to
understand
the
world
in
moral
terms
conscience
was
the
process
by
which
a
person
brought
the
principles
of
 
synderesis
 
into
a
practical
situation
through
our
decisions
so
we
would
know
how
to
act
virtuously
under
the
circumstances
a
conscience
which
is
both
well
formed
shaped
by
education
and
experience
and
well
informed
aware
of
facts
evidence
and
so
on
enables
us
to
know
ourselves
and
our
world
and
act
accordingly
seeing
conscience
in
this
way
is
important
because
it
teaches
us
ethics
is
not
innate
by
continuously
working
to
understand
our
surroundings
we
strengthen
our
moral
muscle
conscientious
objection
in
politics
much
of
the
debate
around
conscience
concerns
the
 
“
right
to
 
conscientious
objection
”
for
a
long
time
western
nations
informed
by
the
catholic
intellectual
tradition
believed
in
the
“
primacy
of
conscience
”
–
the
idea
that
a
person
should
never
be
forced
to
do
something
they
believe
is
against
their
most
deeply
held
values

principles

the
classic
features
of
conscience
follow
from
the
application
of
our
knowledge
of
the
natural
moral
law
to
our
moral
actions
in
three
ways
1
witness
–
by
knowing
whether
we
have
done
or
not
done
something
2
bind
incite
–
“
through
the
conscience
we
judge
that
something
should
be
done
or
not
done
”
3
accuse

rebuke
–
“
by
conscience
we
judge
that
something
done
is
well
done
or
ill
done
”
this
is
how
the
conscience
causes
guilt
conscience
is
our
ability
to
know
whether
we
have
done
something
whether
we
should
have
done
it
and
whether
it
was
done
well
if
we
have
done
something
wrong
our
conscience
will
accuse
torment
and
rebuke
us
–
causing
feelings
of
guilt
because
human
reason
is
fallible
the
conscience
thereby
becomes
fallible
we
could
be
mistaken
for
example
when
we
don
t
 
know
how
a
general
rule
applies
to
a
certain
situation
mistake
in
conscientia
called
apparent
goods
because
they
only
appear
good
to
someone
engaged
in
faulty
reasoning
they
are
not
real
goods
despite
this
potential
for
our
conscience
judging
something
bad
to
be
good
aquinas
still
insists
we
must
follow
it
“
every
judgment
of
conscience
be
it
right
or
wrong
is
obligatory
he
who
acts
against
his
conscience
always
sins
”
this
is
because
if
you
choose
to
act
against
your
conscience
then
you
are
choosing
to
do
something
you
believe
to
be
evil
conscience
is
thus
always
binding
vincible
vs
invincible
ignorance
whether
errors
in
conscience
that
lead
to
sinful
acts
will
be
forgiven
or
pardoned
depends
on
the
type
of
ignorance
that
caused
the
error
very
statement
that
man
is
estranged
from
his
created
nature
presupposes
an
experience
of
the
abyss
between
what
he
essentially
is
and
what
is
existentially
is
even
a
weak
or
misled
conscience
is
still
a
conscience
namely
the
silent
voice
of
man
s
own
essential
nature
judging
his
actual
being
”
–
tillich
to
deny
that
our
conscience
can
discover
the
natural
law
is
to
claim
that
there
is
a
gap
between
what
we
currently
are
and
what
we
could
be
yet
to
have
an
awareness
of
that
gap
is
to
have
a
conscience
that
is
aware
of
its
fallen
state
so
it
is
contradictory
to
deny
the
natural
law
even
it
now
involves
a
weakened
conscience
that
still
tells
us
at
least
something
of
the
direction
we
have
fallen
in
and
the
direction
back
towards
righteousness
however
whatever
a
weak
and
misled
conscience
discovers
is
surely
not
god
s
morality
humanity
believing
it
has
the
ability
to
know
anything
of
god
is
the
same
arrogance
that
caused
adam
and
eve
to
disobey
god
inability
to
be
humble

to
simply
have
faith

freud
thought
the

was

of
psychological
forces

freud
believed
the

was
divided
into
the

our
unconscious
animalistic
desires
ego
our
conscious
thought
responsible
for
many
mental
problems
the
ethical
implications
is
that
conscience
is
not
the
voice
of
god
in
us
it
is
just
what
our
society
wants
from
us
our
society
might
be
good
or
bad
therefore
our
conscience
is
not
the
best
guide
if
freud
is
right
furthermore
there
might
not
even
be
a
good
or
bad
if
morality
is
merely

thus
be
seen
to
defend
freud
to
some
degree
from
the
accusation
of
being
unscientific
he
studied
the
development
of

and
argued
that
there
occurs
a
fundamental
shift
in

the

of
11
children
have
what
he
called
heteronomous
morality
this
means
they
merely
associate
actions
as
bad
because
of
the
influence
of
abstract
cognitive
moral
beliefs
about
how
one
ought
to
act
and
why
freud
s
critique
of
religion
s
approach
to
developing
the
conscience
maintaining
social
order
depends
on
people
repressing
their
antisocial
after
millennia
of
religious
rule
too
many
people
are
still
unhappy
being
controlled
by
social
rules
freud
claims
this
is
because
the
religious
approach
to
conscience
is
external
imposition
by
authority
similar
to
how
children
are
treated
the
result
being
comparable
to
a
childhood
neurosis
although
rules
are
in
place
to
reduce
suffering
perhaps
freud
s
critique
only
really
works
against
approaches
to
the
conscience
like

conscience
i
definition
conscience
is
a
faculty
of
the
mind
that
motivates
us
to
act
morally
—
or
at
least
according
to
our
most
deeply
held
values
 
most
say
it
is
a
form
of
intuition
and
uses
emotion
although
others
have
argued
that
it
should
be
shaped
by
reason
 
it
is
a
private
experience
and
a
form
of
selfknowledge
from
one
s
conscience
one
can
learn
one
s
own
values
and
morals
 
this
is
the
root
of
the
word
from
the
latin
conscientia
perhaps
translatable
as
“
togetherwithknowing
”
–
to
be
together
with
one
s
knowledge
of
morality
yet
conscience
has
been
thought
by
many
to
be
informed
by
an
objective
morality
with
divine
transcendental
or
natural
sources
 
even
in
our
society
where
we
ostensibly
recognize
the
cultural
and
personal
relativity
of
morality
conscience
is
granted
a
special
status
with
laws
protecting
the
rights
of
doctors
and
others
not
to
violate
their
consciences
 
so
conscience
is
private
subjective
and
culturally
relative
but
carries
legal
and
political
weight
there
are
many
different
ideas
about
conscience
—
religious
philosophical
scientific
legal
and
popular
religious
in
most
religions
the
morality
that
informs
conscience
does
or
should
come
from
either
god
or
an
enlightened
mind
religions
differ
as
to
whether
conscience
is
thought
of
mainly
as
a
punisher
e
g
catholic
or
as
a
virtue
to
be
cultivated
e
g
protestant
buddhist
philosophical
many
philosophers
have
written
that
a
truly
moral
conscience
requires
the
exercise
of
reason
others
have
claimed
that
it
is
an
intuition
of
objective
moral
truth
premodern
philosophers
tended
to
believe
in
a
natural
and
objective
morality
informing
conscience
—
something
like
a
truly
moral
instinct
 
modern
philosophers
tend
to
recognize
the
cultural
and
individual
relativity
of
morality
and
many
present
arguments
based
on
scientific
such
as
theories
in
evolutionary
psychology
cognitive
science
and
sociology
legal
our
society
seems
to
recognize
“
freedom
of
conscience
”
–
that
we
should
be
free
to
obey
our
consciences
–
within
limits
considering
that
we
don
t
have
a
clear
or
unified
philosophy
of
conscience
this
raises
legal
political
and
social
issues
popular
our
everyday
notions
of
conscience
are
philosophically
interesting
consider
that
conscience
is
a
part
of
us
opposing
actions
that
we
ourselves
apparently
already
consider
immoral
but
are
in
danger
of
doing
anyway
 
it
seems
a
little
paradoxical
 
why
do
we
need
a
conscience
evolutionary
theory
most
likely
has
the
answer
see
“
history
”
section
thought
about
conscience
is
so
diverse
and
complex
that
a
comprehensive
treatment
is
not
possible
this
seems
another
paradox
about
conscience
we
know
it
most
intimately
in
ourselves
but
there
is
no
consensus
about
where
it
comes
from
or
how
much
it
should
be
respected
 
ii
controversies
about
conscience
freedom
of
conscience
is
part
of
the
united
nations
declaration
of
human
rights
and
the
laws
of
many
nations
 
yet
we
have
reason
to
question
the
idea
 
former
nazi
generals
have
told
interviewers
that
they
acted
with
a
clear
conscience
because
their
actions
were
sanctioned
by
their
leadership
and
society
 
this
would
be
consistent
with
ideas
about
conscience
as
a
social
instinct
but
not
necessarily
an
altruistic
one
as
darwin
thought
—
perhaps
conscience
merely
urges
us
to
conform
with
the
mores
of
our
society
or
beliefsystems
freedom
of
conscience
is
problematic
because
it
s
perfectly
possible
for
people
s
consciences
to
insist
on
actions
that
most
of
consider
harmful
to
other
human
beings
—
such
as
refusing
to
vaccinate
their
children
there
are
several
traditional
arguments
in
favor
of
freedom
of
conscience
the
argument
from
hypocrisy
or
ineffectiveness
most
people
agree
that
it
is
impossible
to
change
a
person
s
conscience
from
the
outside
therefore
not
granting
freedom
of
conscience
means
requiring
people
to
act
contrary
to
their
beliefs
which
seems
wrong
this
was
a
reason
to
consider
persecuting
heretics
however
the
argument
from
hypocrisy
can
be
turned
around
if
you
can
t
change
a
person
s
conscience
then
they
still
have
freedom
of
conscience
even
if
you
force
them
to
behave
in
a
certain
way
the
argument
from
ignorance
this
is
based
on
the
recognition
of
relativism
and
subjectivism
if
our
consciences
don
t
give
us
objective
moral
guidance
then
you
can
t
assume
that
yours
is
right
and
another
s
wrong
therefore
you
don
t
have
a
right
to
deny
them
freedom
of
conscience
the
argument
from
legitimization
john
stuart
mill
argued
that
it
is
best
for
society
if
all
people
express
their
convictions
freely
for
however
none
of
these
arguments
completely
addresses
the
conflicts
between
freedom
of
conscience
and
public
wellbeing
 
some
might
say
that
a
doctor
who
refuses
to
perform
a
lifesaving
operation
out
of
conscience
should
be
charged
with
negligence
or
even
manslaughter
 
while
others
might
feel
that
performing
the
operation
is
murder
the
precise
limits
of
freedom
of
conscience
are
still
an
open
debate
with
profound
consequences

quotes
about
conscience
quotation

“
there
comes
a
time
when
one
must
take
a
position
that
is
neither
safe
nor
politic
nor
popular
but
he
must
take
it
because
conscience
tells
him
it
is
right
”

the
essential
writings
this
quote
seems
to
represent
the
way
most
of
us
naturally
think
of
conscience
—
assuming
that
conscience
is
always
right
as
if
it
s
a
direct
line
to
god
or
some
other
source
of
objective
moral
knowledge
 
this
also
implies
that
it
is
right
to
obey
conscience
even
if
opposes
one
s
social
and
legal
environment
 
one
the
one
hand
these
could
be
incorrect
and
dangerous
assumptions
on
the
other
we
could
never
change
injustice
in
our
society
like
dr
king
without
sometimes
trusting
conscience
over
social
norms

iv
types
of
conscience
there
are
no
types
of
conscience
recognized
by
philosophers
except
critical
conscience
which
means
the
application
of
critical
reasoning
to
ethical
decisions
 
many
religious
webpages
list
their
own
types
of
conscience
in
light
of
their
beliefs
conscience
versus
sociopathy
sociopaths
are
arguably
individuals
with
no
conscience
 
they
are
also
defined
as
incapable
of
feeling
empathy
guilt
fear
or
shame
at
hurting
others
or
violating
any
notion
of
morality
 
interestingly
shows
concrete
differences
between
normal
and
sociopathic
brains
 
ironically
then
sociopaths
seem
to
be
evidence
that
a
capacity
for
conscience
is
innate
in
normal
humans
 
v
history
of
conscience
before
cultural
relativity
and
subjectivism
came
into
vogue
during
the
20th
century
conscience
was
considered
a
source
of
objective
moral
knowledge
by
almost
everyone
however
in
different
senses
in
different
cultures
 
in
ancient
hinduism
buddhism
and
taoism
knowledge
of
good
more
likely
a
source
of
sin
than
morality
 
instead
obedience
to
god
s
law
is
thought
the
only
true
morality
 
this
would
mean
that
true
conscience
is
knowledge
of
god
s
law
whether
that
comes
directly
from
god
or
through
obedience
to
scripture
or
clergy
all
these
possibilities
—
direct
revelation
scripture
and
obedience
to
authorities
–
have
been
claimed
as
the
source
of
moral
knowledge
in
these
religions
 
however
in
practice
these
religions
also
teach
purification
of
the
mind
to
attain
true
conscience
where
eastern
religions
teach
that
a
pure
mind
allows
the
truth
to
emerge
from
within
one
s
own
consciousness
most
versions
of
the
abrahamic
religions
see
a
despite
the
emphasis
on
blind
obedience
in
christianity
medieval
christian
philosophers
developed
a
theory
of
conscience
with
a
strong
role
for
both
intuition
and
reasoning
 
st
bonaventure
and
st
aquinas
wrote
of
synderesis
–
a
divine
spark
of
moral
knowledge
–
which
could
perspective
of
eternity
with
a
peaceful
mind
you
will
perceive
moral
truth
 
 
kant
also
regarded
critical
reasoning
as
an
important
element
of
conscience
believing
that
moral
truth
could
be
evaluated
objectively
in
light
of
his
categorical
imperative
 
other
18th
century
philosophers
believed
that
conscience
was
purely
intuitive
excluding
reason
but
like
kant
many
of
them
also
believed
in
the
objectivity
of
the
moral
truth
informing
conscience
from
the
18th
century
on
increasing
numbers
of
philosophers
spoke
for
pragmatic
and
relativistic
ideas
about
conscience
 
john
locke
wrote
about
how
a
moral
conscience
might
oppose
the
laws
of
the
state
and
thomas
hobbes
insisted
that
opinions
based
on
conscience
could
easily
be
wrong
or
in
contradiction
to
other
people
s
consciences
 
so
these
and
other
philosophers
also
advocated
for
a
critical
conscience
–
and
some
skepticism
about
the
dictates
of
conscience
in
general
in
the
19th
century
darwin
hypothesized
that
conscience
evolved
to
resolve
conflicts
between
instincts
such
as
between
instincts
for
selfpreservation
and
instincts
to
protect
and
cooperate
with
other
human
beings
in
the
20th
century
freud
analyzed
conscience
as
an
effect
of
the
superego
as
we
grow
up
natural
instincts
such
as
aggression
and
sexual
desire
must
be
frequently
frustrated
and
even
punished
by
them
where
darwin
said
that
conscience
evolved
to
resolve
inner
conflicts
other
more
recent
evolutionary
psychologists
suggest
that
it
evolved
to
motivate
altruistic
behavior
which
is
now
thought
to
be
evolutionarily
adaptive
for
social
creatures
few
today
would
claim
that
conscience
is
a
source
of
objective
morality
divine
transcendental
or
otherwise
since
it
is
obvious
that
two
people
s
consciences
or
religions
can
dictate
opposing
moralities
—
such
as
prochoice
and
prolife
 
 
therefore
philosophers
today
are
more
concerned
with
exploring
the
consequences
of
this
relativity
of
conscience
especially
since
people
still
seem
to
think
of
conscience
as
objectively
true
sacred
and
inviolable
which
leads
naturally
to
our
controversy
–
“
freedom
of
conscience
”

1
introduction
each
of
us
has
at
one
time
or
another
talked
about
our
conscience
we
might
have
been
“
pricked
by
our
conscience
”
or
our
conscience
might
have
“
butted
in
”
when
it
was
not
wanted
we
might
be
going
on
quite
happily
telling
a
lie
to
a
friend
or
might
have
accidentally
walked
out
of
a
shop
without
paying
for
something
and
it
is
our
conscience
that
makes
us
confess
or
stops
us
in
our
tracks
spins
us
on
our
heels
and
takes
us
back
into
the
shop
people
from
different
walks
of
life
talk
of
the
“
conscience
”
from
the
religious
believer
the
politician
the
celebrity
to
every
day
folk
we
might
hear
someone
berate
their
conscience
for
nagging
them
to
do
something
they
do
not
want
to
people
might
be
labelled
“
conscientious
objectors
”
because
they
feel
their
conscience
is
telling
them
to
object
to
certain
political
actions
e
g
war
a
protester
might
lament
the
erosion
of
their
“
freedom
of
conscience
”
and
we
can
find
concepts
very
similar
to
“
conscience
”
in
many
nonchristian
religious
traditions
both
eastern
and
western
throughout
history
and
from
around
the
globe
1
however
the
nature
of
conscience
is
obscure
and
consequently
the
philosophical
discussion
of
conscience
is
complex
and
has
a
long
history
it
draws
on
issues
in
philosophical
psychology
philosophy
of
religion
epistemology
philosophy
of
mind
applied
ethics
normative
in
this
chapter
we
ll
give
a
general
overview
of
two
theories
of
conscience
one
draws
on
aquinas
s
account
the
other
sigmund
freud
s
1856
–
1939
although
freud
is
not
typically
seen
as
a
philosopher
he
s
a
psychologist
his
account
will
provide
us
with
some
insights
which
allows
us
to
think
philosophically
about
this
thing
we
call
“
the
conscience
”
2
the
history
of
conscience
in
the
twentyfirst
century
conscience
is
not
thought
of
as
solely
a
religious
idea
however
talk
of
“
conscience
”
was
popularised
at
least
in
“
the
west
”
due
to
its
adoption
by
both
protestant
and
catholic
traditions
in
this
section
we
ll
look
how
“
conscience
”
is
and
has
been
used
in
order
to
draw
out
some
general
features
“
conscience
”
played
a
role
in
one
of
the
most
famous
speeches
in
the
protestant
reformation
martin
luther
1483
–
1546
being
charged
with
heresy
and
being
forced
to
recant
by
charles
v
stands
his
grounds
and
says
“
here
i
stand
i
can
do
no
other
”
and
“
i
cannot
nor
will
i
retract
anything
since
it
is
never
safe
nor
virtuous
to
go
against
conscience
”
luther
believed
that
his
godgiven
conscience
was
not
allowing
him
to
recant
not
even
under
the
considerable
pressure
by
the
powerful
people
before
him
or
consider
a
more
recent
example
his
views
said
but
conscience
asks
the
question
is
it
right
and
there
comes
a
time
when
we
must
take
a
position
that
is
neither
safe
nor
politic
nor
popular
but
one
must
take
it
because
it
is
right
2
conscience
is
then
powerful
it
seems
that
it
can
move
a
person
to
put
themselves
in
mortal
danger
to
“
stand
up
and
be
counted
”
to
act
contrary
to
selfinterest
but
it
is
not
just
saints
and
heroes
that
talk
of
conscience
conscience
has
been
cited
by
the
most
repugnant
and
morally
abhorrent
people
who
have
ever
lived
racists
murderers
tyrants
dictators
for
example
as
bettina
stangneth
s
states
in
eichmann
before
jerusalem
the
unexamined
life
of
a
mass
murderer3
a
discussion
of
the
inner
life
of
one
of
the
nazi
s
most
notorious
officers
“
conscience
was
simply
the
morality
of
the
fatherland
that
dwells
within
a
person
which
eichmann
also
termed
the
voice
of
the
blood
”
conscience
can
be
male
or
female
or
both
or
neither
it
can
be
one
voice
or
many
it
can
echo
religious
ideas
social
ideas
racist
ideas
lofty
ideas
or
ideas
found
in
the
filth
of
human
corruption
conscience
can
develop
at
any
particular
age
and
dissipates
at
any
age
it
does
not
“
speak
”
and
it
does
“
speak
”
and
does
not
have
a
language
of
choice
there
seem
to
be
at
least
three
related
functions
that
we
think
the
conscience
plays
first
it
tells
us
what
we
ought
to
do
as
a
guide
for
our
lives
second
it
is
a
source
of
moral
knowledge
that
is
we
might
say
“
i
know
that
stealing
a
pen
is
wrong
because
my
conscience
told
me
”
third
it
might
be
thought
of
as
a
motivation
that
is
it
might
be
the
thing
that
actually
gets
us
up
out
of
our
seat
to
act
in
certain
ways
just
to
clarify
we
can
see
the
difference
in
the
first
two
of
these
functions
if
we
think
of
a
tyrant
who
says
for
example
“
my
conscience
tells
me
i
have
to
kill
all
mentally
ill
people
to
help
the
country
”
clearly
this
is
a
case
where
her
conscience
is
telling
her
how
she
ought
to
behave
but
given
that
we
think
that
killing
the
mentally
ill
is
morally
wrong
we
do
not
want
to
say
that
in
this
case
her
conscience
gives
her
knowledge
of
what
is
right
and
wrong
so
it
might
be
true
that
the
conscience
gives
us
guidance
but
not
knowledge
equally
the
opposite
seems
true
that
we
might
know
what
is
right
and
wrong
yet
fail
to
be
guided
to
do
it
this
predicament
is
what
shakespeare
captured
in
this
famous
quotation
“
conscience
doth
make
cowards
of
us
all
”

consider
another
point
conscience
is
subjective
in
that
it
is
about
one
reflecting
inwards
on
oneself
on
how
one
might
“
feel
”
about
certain
things
it
is
not
about
looking
out
into
the
world
at
a
set
of
rules
or
laws
we
experience
the
conscience
differently
than
we
would
if
a
friend
priest
politician
or
imam
was
telling
us
what
to
do
of
course
although
conscience
is
“
inward
looking
”
that
is
not
the
same
as
saying
that
we
just
make
up
what
the
conscience
allegedly
tells
us
for
instance
we
might
think
that
what
is
right
and
wrong
is
dependent
on
god
but
also
think
that
we
come
to
know
what
is
right
and
wrong
through
our
conscience
finally
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
term
“
conscience
”
was
only
formalized
in
its
modern
moral
meaning
in
the
mid
eighteenth
century
e
g
neither
plato
nor
aristotle
talk
of
conscience
however
note
that
just
because
a
term
is
modern
or
just
because
there
is
disagreement
with
how
a
term
is
used
that
does
not
mean
that
the
ideas
scientific
community
this
in
itself
does
not
lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
there
are
no
molecules
and
no
atoms
so
the
lack
of
term
“
conscience
”
and
disagreement
about
what
“
conscience
”
means
does
not
mean
that
conscience
is
merely
an
“
invention
”
with
all
these
points
in
mind
let
s
consider
one
of
the
key
thinkers
in
relation
to
conscience
aquinas
3
aquinas
on
conscience
if
you
recall
from
aquinas
developed
a
natural
law
theology
the
basic
they
show
that
the
requirements
of
the
law
are
written
on
their
hearts
their
consciences
also
bearing
witness
and
their
thoughts
sometimes
accusing
them
and
at
other
times
even
defending
them
4
notice
then
that
for
paul
—
and
aquinas
—
the
“
conscience
”
bears
witness
sometimes
accusing
the
person
sometimes
defending
them
for
aquinas
conscience
is
morally
neutral
it
simply
“
bears
witness
”
it
is
a
“
signpost
”
and
after
all
signposts
do
not
opinions
on
things
see
aquinas
summa

to
be
clear
then
aquinas
did
not
take
conscience
to
be
a
source
of
moral
knowledge
but
as
a
guide
this
means
that
aquinas
unlike
luther
and
postreformation
thinkers
took
conscience
to
be
fallible
for
aquinas
we
may
be
wrong
in
following
our
conscience
as
it
can
move
us
in
the
wrong
directionmislead
us
for
aquinas
the
conscience
is
the
act
of
applying
the
universal
principles

eternaldivine
law
to
actual

aquinas
explicitly
defines
“

so
if
conscience
for
aquinas
is
about
the
application
of
knowledge
to
activity
this
raises
the
question
how
we
get
this
knowledge
this
is
where
another
key
technical
term
is
introduced
the
synderesis
synderesis
is
not
the
same
as
conscience
but
is
the
innate
ability
of
the
mind
—
what
he
calls
a
habit
of
the
mind
—
to
apprehend
the
eternaldivine
laws
the
role
of
conscience
is
to
apply
the
primary
precepts
discovered
as
the
content
of
synderesis
reflection
they
will
see
that
it
is
the
straight
line
this
“
coming
to
recognize
through
reflection
”
is
what
aquinas
has
in
mind
when
he
talks
about
synderesis
for
aquinas
unlike
conscience
synderesis
is
never
mistaken
humans
do
wrong
thinks
aquinas
when
conscience
and
not
synderesis
makes
a
mistake
this
means
that
a
failure
of
conscience
needs
to
be
clearly
thought
through
on
aquinas
s
account
for
aquinas
conscience
errs
because
of
ignorance
about
how
to
apply
the
eternaldivine
laws
of
which
there
are
two
types
ignorance
that
can
be
overcome
by
using
one
s
reason
vincible
ignorance
and
ignorance
that
invincible
ignorance
is
doing
something
wrong
when
one
could
not
have
known
better
vincible
ignorance
is
doing
wrong
when
one
ought
to
have
known
better
but
how
might
this
relate
to
conscience
imagine
two
people
going
into
a
gun
shop
the
first
person
has
no
and
they
have
no
record
of
mental
illness
he
is
for
all
intents
and
purposes
a
model
citizen
this
person
buys
a
gun
and
goes
on
a
killing
rampage
the
owner
of
the
shop
by
following
her
conscience
has
not
done
something
morally
wrong
because
her
ignorance
is
invincible
there
was
no
indication
that
this
would
have
been
a
likely
outcome
this
contrasts
to
the
person
who
is
sold
a
gun
even
though
he
has
a
violent
criminal
record
which
would
have
shown
up
on
a
basic
background
check
in
this
case
the
owner
of
the
gun
shop
following
her
conscience
has
done
something
morally
wrong
because
in
this
case
her
ignorance
is
vincible
and
wrong
through
synderesis
however
even
though
we
are
infallible
about
this
we
can
and
do
make
mistakes
in
applying
this
knowledge
it
is
our
conscience
conscientia
which
tells
us
how
to
apply
this
knowledge
and
moves
us
to
act
it
can
go
wrong
through
ignorance
ignorance
which
could
have
been
avoided
vincible
means
our
action
is
in
the
next
section
we
will
consider
what
freud
has
to
say
about
conscience
and
explain
how
he
reconceptualises
it
as
a
psychological
and
not
theological
concept
and
in
doing
so
argues
we
should
not
accept
it
as
an
inherently
good
notion

freud
and
the
conscience
freud
is
best
known
as
a
psychologist
and
the
architect
of
talk
in
the
form
of
a
“
freudian
slip
”
among
freud
s
many
ideas
his
conceptualization
of
the
structure
of
the
mind
is
key
to
his
views
on
conscience
he
thinks
the
mind
can
be
thought
of
as
containing
three
parts
the
id
the
ego
and
the
superego
freud
s
account
of
conscience
is
understood
as
the
relation
between
these
from
the
superego
where
does
the
conscience
come
in
for
freud
the
conscience
is
the
form
that
the
superego
takes
in
addressing
the
ego
when
the
internalized
authority
derived
from
parental
socialreligious
rules
and
regulations
controls
the
ego
is
it
is
understood
as
“
the
conscience
”
in
our
last
example
it
is
our
“
conscience
”
that
tells
us
to
remove
our
elbows
from
the
table
notice
then
that
our
conscience
often
requires
certain
things
from
us
which
we
fail
to
achieve
and
this
gives
rise
to
guilt
for
freud
the
conscience
can
be
thought
of
as
synonymous
with
the
“
guilty
conscience
”
our
ego
is
punished
through
guilt
by
the
form
of
the
superego
we
call
conscience
furthermore
freud
says
that
when
the
superego
fails
to
deal
properly
with
the
id
—
when
the
pleasure
principle
is
repressed
—
this
forms
what
he
calls
neurosis
you
can
also
hopefully
see
the
differences
between
aquinas
and
freud
first
the
obvious
point
is
that
for
freud
the
conscience
is
not
the
voice
of
god
second
unlike
aquinas
freud
thinks
that
the
conscience
could
be
bad
destructive
and
unhelpful
the
conscience
is
the
way
the
ego
experiences
the
authority
of
the
superego
but
the
superego
is
arrived
at
through
the
experiences
we
have
and
of
course
we
might
have
had
really
bad
experiences
growing
up
where
parents
are
stifling
overly
authoritarian
distant
cold
hard
violent
abusive
etc
in
these
sorts
of
cases
the
conscience
would
be
stifling
overly
authoritarian
distant
etc
this
means
that
although
freud
does
not
think
we
can
or
should
get
rid
of
the
conscience
he
does
think
we
should
treat
it
with
a
healthy
dose
of
scepticism
and
hence
not
be
kowtowed
by
the
“
guilt
”
that
is
our
ego
s
punishment
for
falling
short
of
the
superego
conscience
is
the
product
of
our
often
nonideal
upbringing
rather
than
a
divinelyinspired
force
for
good
generally
a
pursuit
of
pleasure
and
happiness
people
become
sexually
active
fall
in
love
and
get
married
this
is
the
stage
where
we
acquire
a
fully
developed
conscience
summary
the
notion
of
“
conscience
”
has
appeared
for
thousands
of
years
in
different
cultures
even
though
it
has
not
always
been
called
“
conscience
”
modern
christian
orthodoxy
popularised
it
and
characterised
it
in
relation
to
god
s
voice
and
guidance
aquinas
thought
that
conscience
is
the
way
we
understand
how
to
apply
what
we
know
in
aquinas
s
view
our
conscience
is
fallible
and
might
guide
us
wrongly
when
our
conscience
“
gets
it
wrong
”
we
can
be
either
culpable
—
through
vincible
ignorance
—
or
not
culpable
—
through
invincible
ignorance
freud
is
less
convinced
that
conscience
is
a
force
for
good
and
he
is
certain
that
it
has
not
got
anything
to
do
with
god
for
freud
conscience
can
be
either
a
good
or
bad
we
can
think
of
our
mind
as
having
three
parts
the
id
ego
and
superego
the
conscience
for
freud
is
the
form
the
superego
takes
when
it
is
trying
to
keep
the
ego
in
line
it
is
internalized
as
the
voice
of
authority
the
superego
is
about
following
rules
but
those
rules
do
not
come
from
“
on
high
”
they
derive
from
the
upbringing
we
have
had
so
if
we
have
had
a
repressive
upbringing
then
the
superego
—
the
voice
of
conscience
—
will
be
repressive
how
we
develop
these
three
features
of
the
mind
is
through
what
freud
calls
psychosexual
development
if
we
do
not
develop
common
student
mistakes
writing
conscious
when
meaning
conscience
confuse
synderesis
and
conscience
confusing
conscience
as
guidance
with
conscience
as
the
source
of
knowledge
believe
freud
thinks
the
conscience
is
always
bad
thinking
that
for
aquinas
conscience
is
way
of
knowing
what
is
right
and
wrong
thinking
that
because
the
term
conscience
is
new
conscience
itself
is
a
modern
invention
issues

do
you

you
have
a

what
does
it
tell
you
2
what
is
the

between
synderesis

3
do
you

that
everyone
ultimately
knows
—
if
they
reason
correctly
—
what
is
right
and
wrong
of
the
supposedly
invincible
knowledge
really
vincible
we
just
need
to
try
harder
5
what
are
the
possible
different
roles
for
the
conscience
6
could
the
conscience
be
a
morally
bad
thing
7
why
does
freud
think
we
need
to
be
cautious
about
listening
to
our
conscience

how
does
freud

relate

conscience
a
personal
sense
of
the
moral
content
of
one
s
own
conduct
intentions
or
character
with
regard
to
a
feeling
of
obligation
to
do
right
or
be
good
conscience
usually
informed
by
acculturation
and
instruction
is
thus
generally
understood
to
give
intuitively
authoritative
judgments
regarding
the
moral
quality
of
single
actions
a
faculty
ancient
egyptians
for
example
were
urged
not
to
transgress
against
the
dictates
of
the
heart
for
one
“
must
stand
in
fear
of
departing
from
its
guidance
”
in
some
belief
systems
conscience
is
regarded
as
the
voice
of
god
and
therefore
a
completely
reliable
guide
of
conduct
among
the
hindus
it
is
considered
“
the
invisible
god
who
dwells
within
us
”
among
western
religious
groups
the
society
of
friends
or
quakers
places
particular
emphasis
on
the
role
of
conscience
in
apprehending
and
responding
through
conduct
to
the
“
inner
light
”
of
god
outside
the
context
of
religion
philosophers
social
scientists
and
psychologists
have
sought
to
understand
conscience
in
both
its
individual
and
universal
aspects
the
view
that
holds
conscience
to
be
an
innate
intuitive
faculty
determining
the
perception
of
right
and
wrong
is
called
intuitionism
the
view
that
holds
conscience
to
be
a
cumulative
and
subjective
inference
from
past
experience
giving
direction
to
future
conduct
is
called
empiricism
the
behavioral
scientist
on
the
other
hand
may
view
the
conscience
as
a
set
of
learned
responses
to
particular
social
stimuli
another
explanation
of
conscience
was
put
forth
in
the
20th
century
by
sigmund
freud
in
his
postulation
of
the
superego
according
to
freud
the
superego
is
a
major
element
of
personality
that
is
formed
by
the
child
s
incorporation
of
moral
values
through
parental
approval
or
punishment
the
resulting
internalized
set
of
prohibitions
condemnations
and
inhibitions
is
that
part
of
the
superego

as
conscience

the

these
three
commonly

words
what
does
conscious
mean
what
does
conscience
mean
what

conscientious
mean
do

three
words
conscience
is
a
noun
that
means
“
an
inner
feeling

voice
that

whether
your
actions

conscious
is
an

the
words

conscious

conscientious
do
not
fall
under
this
category
they
look

they
have
three
distinct
definitions
below
we

go
over
what
does
“
conscience
”
mean
conscience
ˈkɑːnʃəns
is
a
noun
that
refers
to
the
“
inner
feeling
or
voice
that
tells
us
what
is
morally
right
or
wrong
and
impels
us
towards
right
action
”
i
advised
my
niece
to
let
her
conscience
guide
her
when
someone
has
a
guilty
conscience
it
means
that
“
they
feel
guilty
about
something
they
did
that
they
perceive
as
wrong
”
my
guilty
conscience
kept
me
up
all
night
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
spectrum
when
someone
has
a
clear
conscience
they
feel
that
they
did
the
right
thing
and
therefore
feel
no
guilt
my
conscience
was
clear
because
i
knew
i
did
the
right
thing
she
was
a
conscientious
student
and
graduated
at
the
top
of
her
class
conscientious
also
refers
to
“
being
governed
by
conscience
to
do
what
s
right
”

doing
what
is
morally
right

our
conscience
can
be
described
as
our
knowledge
of
ourselves
our
awareness
of
the
moral
principles
we
are
committed
to
and
our
motivation
to
act
one
of
the
most
fundamental
teachings
in
the
catholic
tradition
is
the
primacy
of
conscience
this
doctrine
states
that
catholics
must
use
their
reason
to
discern
ethically
complex
situations
and
that
our
individual
consciences
should
be
the
final
arbiter
in
all
moral
decisionmaking
the
catechism
of
the
catholic
church
states
that
we
have
the
right
to
act
in
conscience
and
in
freedom
to
make
moral
decisions
and
that
no
one
should
be
forced
to
act
contrary
to
their

as
catholics
we
believe
that
we
must
use
all
of
the
resources
available
to
us
to
form
our
consciences
so
that
we
can
make
the
best
possible
decisions

in

we
are
conscious
of
the
fact
that
poverty

it

what
is

and
why
does
it

the
freedom

america

and

is

to
protecting
that
freedom
what
is
freedom
of
conscience
and
why
does
it

what
is
“
conscience
”
it
s
a
word
we
re
all
familiar
with
—
a
clear
conscience
a
guilty
conscience
—
even
if
we
can
t
pinpoint
an
exact
definition
the
concept
pops
up
in
all
kinds
of
places
in

the
final
good
act
after
a
lifetime
of
evil
but
none
of
these
examples
capture
the
full
concept
of
conscience
as
americans
we
should
consider
the
true
meaning
of
“
conscience
”
we
should
also
recognize
the
importance
—
and
privilege
—
of
having
the
freedom
of
conscience
america
was
founded
on
this
freedom
and
it
s
worth
preserving
today
read
on
to
find
out
why
what
is
freedom
of
conscience
conscience
is
our
godgiven
ability
to
discern
right
from
wrong
good
from
evil
but
it
s
more
than
that
for
knowing
right
from
wrong
wouldn
t
do
much
good
if
we
didn
t
or
couldn
t
act
on
what
s
right
so
conscience
also
includes
the
ability
to
apply
laws
rules
and
intuitions
in
the
right
way
in
other
words
to
act
on
what
we
believe
action
by
serving
others
where
is
freedom
of
conscience
found
in
the
constitution
america
s
founders
understood
the
gravity
of
protecting
the
freedom
of
conscience
james
madison
called
conscience
“
the
most
sacred
of
all
property
”
thomas
jefferson
said
that
no
“
provision
in
our
constitution
ought
to
be
dearer
to
man
than
that
which
protects
the
rights
of
conscience
against
”
the
government
and
during
the
debate
over
what
would
become
the
first
amendment
many
lawmakers
proposed
protecting
the
rights
of
conscience
this
understanding
shaped
the
first
amendment
although
the
amendment
doesn
t
explicitly
mention
“
conscience
”
it
protects
its
animating
features
religious
freedom
and
free
speech
the
first
amendment
says
“
congress
shall
make
no
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion
or
speech
or
of
the
press
”
why
is
freedom
of
conscience
important
these
26
words
protect
the
freedom
of
conscience
—
the
freedom
to
believe
without
coercion
and
to
speak
and
act
consistently
with
those
beliefs
things
to
which
we
object
so
we
have
the
freedom
to
think
reason
speak
stay
silent
about
and
hold
certain
beliefs
without
fearing
government
punishment
that
protects
our
private
conscience
but
our
internal
beliefs
often
move
us
to
act
publicly
so
the
first
the
freedom
to
act
on
our
beliefs
is
important
because
community
standards
—
or
lack
thereof
—
reflect
individuals
conscience
the
more
we
train
our
conscience
to
do
what
is
right
the
better
off
we
will
be
but
we
lose
our
ability
to
discern
right
from
wrong
the
more
we
consistently
ignore
our
conscience
the
freedom
of
conscience
has
also

freedom
of
conscience
for
healthcare
professionals
beyond
speech
the
freedom
of
conscience
is
imperative
in
the
medical
field
since
ancient
times
physicians
have
sworn
to
“
do
no
harm
”
to
their
patients
fast
forward
to
present
day
and
professional
medical
ethics
acknowledge
the
rights
of
professionals
to
decline
to
provide
medical
treatment
that
violates
their
conscience
the
justification
echoes
the
first
amendment
—
to
preserve
the
personal
the

must
proceed
freedom
of
conscience
for
faithbased
ministries
the
freedom
of
conscience
allows
faithbased
ministries
to
provide
other
public
services
to
care
for
the
most
vulnerable
among
us
for
example
adf
has
twice
defended
downtown
hope
center
a
christian
nonprofit
these
ministries
provide
critical
services
to
their
communities
and
they
do
so
because
of
their
religious
beliefs
this
is
a
common
feature
of
american
history
made
possible
by
the
freedom
of
conscience
in
that
way
protecting
the
ability
of
these
ministries
to
live
out
their
faith
ensures
that
other
religious
organizations
can
do
the
same
while

we

what

it
is
the
intent
of
the
legislature
to
provide
the
right
of
medical
conscience
for
health
care
providers
and
payors
to
ensure
they
can
care
for
patients
in
a
manner
consistent
with
their
moral
ethical
and
religious
convictions
further
it
is
the
intent
of
the
legislature
that
licensed
health
care
providers
and
payors
be
free
from
threat
of
discrimination
for
providing
consciencebased
health
care
this
legislature
coupled
this
“
right
of
medical
conscience
”
with
a
provision
protecting
the
“
use
of
free
speech
by
a
health
care
practitioner
”
to
create
a
comprehensive
legislative
package
that
was
a
priority
of
gov
ron
desantis
this
analysis
of
sb
1580
will
attempt
to
explain
how
these
two
new
provisions
affect
the
practice
of
medicine
right
of
medical
conscience
sb
1580
creates
a
new
section
of
the
florida
statutes
¹
that
gives
health
care
providers
and
health
care
payors
the
right
to
“
opt
out
of
participation
in
or
payment
for
any
health
care
service
on
the
basis
of
a
consciencebased
objection
”
it
is
important
to
note
that
this
right
of
conscience
only
applies
to
a
“
health
care
service
”
it
does
not
give
a
health
care
provider
the
right
to
refuse
to
perform
job
requirements
that
do
not
involve
the
provision
performed
or
provided
by
any
health
care
provider
if
a
health
care
provider
has
a
consciencebased
objection
to
performing
abortions
the
provider
may
not
be
discriminated
against
or
suffer
adverse
action
for
refusing
to
perform
abortions
however
a
provider
patients
based
on
the
patient
s
race
color
religion
sex
or
national
origin
the
right
of
conscience
is
solely
attached
to
a
specific
health
care
service
a
provider
can
refuse
to
prescribe
contraceptives
to
hisher
patients
but
cannot
refuse
to
prescribe
contraceptives
to
only
medicaid
procedure
to
hisher
patients
may
not
refuse
to
provide
that
procedure
to
a
subset
of
patients
who
engage
in
a
certain
type
of
behavior
even
if
the
provider
has
a
consciencebased
objection
to
that
behavior
while
the
bill
sponsors
made
it
clear
as
to
what
the
right
of
conscience
applies
to
they
left
the
issue
of
whether
a
conscientious
objection
exists
less
certain
sb
1580
defines
a
“
consciencebased
objection
”
as
an
objection
based
on
a
sincerely
held
religious
moral
or
ethical
belief
²
as
noted
in
the
footnote
whether
an
entity
such
as
an
insurance
company
has
a
conscience
is
determined
by
existing
written
evidence
if
the
articles
of
incorporation
for
an
insurer
state
that
the
company
exists
to
provide
health
insurance
for
individuals
whose
federal
requirement
if
the
company
cannot
produce
a
governing
document
published
guideline
or
set
of
policies
or
regulations
it
will
not
be
entitled
to

individual

providers
³
on
the
other
hand
do
not
have
to
produce
written
evidence
attesting
to
a
sincerely
held
religious
moral
general
as
the
entity
given
enforcement
authority
for
this
statute
to
determine
whether
a
health
care
provider
alleging
a
violation
has
a
valid
consciencebased
objection
presumably
the
attorney
general
will
assess
a
provider
s
selfprofessed
belief
on
a
casebycase
basis
in
a
manner
congruent
with
the
inquiry
used
for
similar
laws
such
as
title
accommodation
for
employee

sincerely

health

providers
and
payors
who
wish
to
opt
out
of
participation
in

for
a
health

service
due
to
a
consciencebased
objection
must
do
the
following
patient
s

file
notify
patients
seeking
an
appointment
for
a
health
care
service
that
the
provider
has
a
consciencebased
objection
to
of
that
objection
before
scheduling
the
appointment
providers
who
are
students
must
provide
written
notice
of
their
consciencebased
objection
to
the
educational
institution
at
the
time
the
objection
is
made
or
as
soon
as
practicable
providers
who
comply
with
these
requirements
may
not
be
discriminated
against
⁴
or
suffer
adverse
action
⁵
for
exercising
their
right
of
medical
conscience
the
right
of
medical
conscience
section
also
includes
speech
and
whistleblower
protections
which
prohibit
discriminating
or
taking
adverse
action
against
health
care
providers
or
payors
who
report
violations
of
the
new
right
of
medical
conscience
statute
this
protection
is
extended
to
providers
who
testify
assist
or
participate
in
a
proceeding
brought
by
the
attorney
general
to
determine
if
a
interestingly
this
part
of
the
new
law
also
includes
a
prohibition
on
discriminating
against
a
health
care
provider
or
payor
for
reasons
not
related
to
the
right
of
medical
conscience
protection
from
discrimination
is
extended
to
the
disclosure
of
information
the
provider
or
payor
reasonably
believes
constitutes
under
the
original
house
companion
to
sb
1580
health
care
providers
and
payors
were
given
a
civil
cause
of
action
for
any
violation
of
the
right
of
conscience
section
sb
1580
however
rejected
this
approach
in
favor
of
allowing
the
attorney
general
to
investigate
complaints
and
bring
a
civil
action
for
damages
injunctive
or
other

health

who
decline

because
of

objection
may
not
be
held
civilly
liable
on
that
basis
alone
finally
acknowledging
the
existence
of
federal
emtala
requirements
the
legislature
specifically
stated
that

freedom
of
conscience
is
one
of
the
fundamental
freedoms
protected
by
section
2
of
the
 
canadian
charter
of
rights
and
freedoms
1
what
is
the
legal
impact
of
this
freedom
ultimately
the
freedom
of
conscience
constitutionally
recognizes
“
the
centrality
of
individual
conscience
and
the
inappropriateness
of
governmental
intervention
to
constrain
its
manifestation
”
2
 
in
fact
the
supreme
court
has
ruled
that
“
an
emphasis
on
individual
conscience
and
individual
judgment
lies
at
the
heart
of
our
democratic
political
tradition
the
ability
of
each
citizen
to
make
free
and
informed
what
is
legally
protected
from
government
interference
the
only
supreme
court
case
considering
the
freedom
of
conscience
directly
is
 
r
v
morgentaler
4
this
1988
case
dealt
with
the
constitutionality
of
abortion
laws
justice
wilson
stated
“
the
decision
whether
or
not
to
terminate
a
pregnancy
is
essentially
a
moral
decision
and
the
conscience
of
the
individual
must
be
paramount
”
5
 
she
also
held
that
the
freedoms
guaranteed
by
section
2a
“
should
be
broadly
construed
to
extend
to
conscientiouslyheld
without
guidance
from
the
supreme
court
lower
courts
have
had
to
figure
out
on
their
own
what
the
freedom
of
conscience
protects
from
the
limited
jurisprudence
that
exists
we
know
“
the
guarantee
of
freedom
of
conscience
is
directed
at
an
individual
s
overarching
normative
value
system
”
7
 
if
a
person
s
actions
are
not
motivated
by
a
“
comprehensive
value
system
”
in
a
secular
context
 
then
they
are
not
protected
by
section
2a
8
 
this
can
be
quite
limiting
when
people
have
argued
that
their
freedom
of
conscience
was
violated
by
mandatory
seatbelt
laws
for
example
their
arguments
failed
because
their
objections
were
not
supported
by
a
comprehensive
value
system
insubstantial
infringements
upon
a
person
s
conscience
are
also
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
guarantee
9
 
this
is
a
limitation
that
all
the
fundamental
freedoms
share
the
 
freedom
of
religion
 
for
instance
one
of
the
few
lower
court
decisions
solely
considering
the
freedom
of
conscience
rather
than
conscience
and
religion
together
was
 
maurice
v
canada
attorney
general
11
mr
maurice
wanted
to
receive
vegetarian
meals
in
prison
originally
he
was
provided
with
these
meals
in
successfully
claimed
that
since
he
remained
vegetarian
for
conscientious
reasons
this
was
a
violation
of
his
freedom
of
conscience
12
 
the
federal
court
agreed
declaring
that
the
“
charter
 
entitles
the
applicant
to
a
vegetarian
diet
”
13
the
freedom
of
conscience
garnered
some
attention
in
2015
when
the
supreme
court
decided
 
carter
v
canada
attorney
general
in
that
case
a
number
of
interveners
claimed
that
providing
access
to
physicianassisted
dying
would
infringe
the
freedom
of
conscience
of
medical
professionals
14
 
this
argument
went
beyond
the
scope
of
what
needed
to
be
decided
in
that
case
however
the
court
noted
that
physicianassisted
dying
was
indeed
a
“
matter
of
conscience
”
and
that
at
some
point
“
the
 
charter
rights
of
patients
and
physicians
will
need
to
be
reconciled
”
15
what
are
the
limitations
on
the
freedom
of
conscience
while
the
freedom
of
conscience
is
a
fundamental
freedom
it
is
not
absolute
as
with
all
other
rights
and
freedoms
in
the
 
charter
if
a
breach
of
this
freedom
is
found
by
a
court
the
government
can
argue

the
modern
misunderstanding
of
conscience
the
catholic
church
teaches
that
the
conscience
is
a
natural
facility
of
our
reason
that
directs
us
to
do
good
and
avoid
evil
that
makes
judgments
about
the
good
and
evil
of
particular
acts
and
that
bears
witness
after
the
fact
to
the
good
or
evil
that
we
have
done
such
as
what
we
call
“
having
a
guilty
conscience
”
¹
a
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
the
role
of
the
human
conscience
lies
at
the
root
of
many
of
the
problems
in
the
catholic
church
today
very
few
catholics
even
know
what
that
role
actually
is
when
pressed
many
will
say
something
along
the
lines
of
“
if
my
conscience
tells
me
that
a
particular
action
is
all
right
i
can
do
it
”
this
is
just
another
way
of
saying
“
if
it
feels
good
do
it
”
if
an
improperlyformed
conscience
leads
a
person
to
accept
something
as
right
and
good
based
simply
on
his
or
her
uninformed
opinions
and
feelings
that
person
will
fall
into
grave
errors
for
which
there
is
no
good
they
are
a
law
to
themselves
even
though
they
do
not
have
the
law
they
show
that
what
the
law
requires
is
written
on
their
hearts
while
their
conscience
also
bears
witness
and
their
conflicting
thoughts
accuse
or
perhaps
excuse
them
on
that
day
when
according
to
my
gospel
god
judges
the
secrets
of
men

christ
jesus
romans

many
catholics
erroneously
believe
that
the
conscience
is
a
teacher
not
a
pupil
that
it
is
the
source
of
morality
this
is
not
the
teaching
of
the
catholic
church
according
to
the
church
the
conscience
is
a
witness
to
the
moral
law
authored
by
god
each
catholic
is
required
to
obey
that
moral
law
in
all
things
the
conscience
if
properly
formed
calls
him
to
obey
that
moral
law
and
helps
him
to
understand
how
to
apply
it
in
particular
cases
result
a
deformed
belief
system
the
belief
that
the
conscience
is
a
moral
authority
in
its
own
right
has
resulted
in
catholics
supporting
and
promoting
many
intrinsic
evils
including
contraception
sterilization
abortion
homosexual
activity
many
organizations
vigorously
promote
this
false
understanding
of
the
human
conscience
in
order
to
gain
more
support
from
catholic
laity
one
of
these
groups
is
“
catholics
”
for
choice
cfc
whose
mission
consists
of
attempting
to
convince
people
that
they
can
be
proabortion
and
still
be
“
good
catholics
”
in
its
quarterly
magazine
ironically
entitled
conscience
cfc
attempts
to
legitimize
the
obvious
paradox
that
“
church
law
affirms
both
the
right
and
the
responsibility
of
a
catholic
to
follow
his
or
her
conscience
even
when
it
conflicts
with
church
teaching
”
²
emphasis
added
cfc
also
alleges
the
catholic
church
officially
teaches
that
the
conscience
of
an
individual
is
supreme
if
you
carefully
examine
your
conscience
and
then
decide
that
an
abortion
is
the
most
moral
act
you
can
do
at
this
time
you
are
not
committing
a
sin
therefore
you
are
not
it
is
easy
to
demonstrate
that
cfc
does
not
really
believe
this
principle
itself
for
example
would
it
concede
that
it
was
legitimate
for
someone
to
“
carefully
examine
their
conscience
”
and
then
decide
that
torching
an
abortion
clinic
in
the
middle
of
the
night
was
“
the
most
moral
act
they
could
do
at

personal
judgement
vs
objective
standards
how
does
conscience
relate
to
morality
in
order
for
a
person
s
conscience
to
be
conditioned
to
accept
evil
it
must
first
decisively
turn
away
from
god
s
teachings
and
decide
that
it
can
determine
for
itself
what
is
right
and
wrong
ignoring
all
external
this
means
that
dissenters
must
justify
their
claims
by
assuming
that
there
is
no
fixed
morality
that
is
binding
on
all
persons
the
only
source
of
morality
is
the
conscience
of
each
individual
one
phrase
that
is
coming
into
common
usage
among
the
selfappointed
elite
is
“
this
is
my

law
gives

it
is
one
thing
for
a
person
to
say
“

disagree
with
the
church
s
teaching
on
abortion
”
it
is
another
thing
entirely
to
say
“
the
church
teaches
that
abortion
is
permissible
so
long
as
my
conscience
allows
it
”
this
statement
is
false
and
can
only
be
uttered
by
one
who
is
grossly
ignorant
of

teaching
or
who
deliberately
lies
about
such
a
person
is
culpable
for
the
evil
he
commits
when
he
“
takes
little
trouble
to
find
out
what
is
true
and
good
or
when
conscience
is
by
degrees
almost
blinded
through
the
habit
of
committing
sin
”

the
catechism
states
“
the

indispensable
for
human
beings

a
dead
giveaway
that
a
person
s
conscience
is
improperly
formed
is
when
he
or
she
says
something
like
“
i
respect
the
teachings
of
the
church
but
i
follow
my
own
conscience
in

nancy

a

when
she
claimed
that
she
was

this
means
that

”
is
man
s
instinctual
knowledge
of
what
is
right

what
is
wrong
―
his
“

”
however
the
conscience
must
work
with
the
teachings
of
the
church
never
against
it
the
church
as
demonstrated
in
a
particularly
vivid
manner
by
her
martyrs
has
always
held
that
a
person
s
properlyformed
conscience
may
never
be
violated
countless
men
women
and
even
children
have
courageously
stated
“
you
may
kill
me
but
you
will
never
force
me
to
violate
my
conscience
”
this
principle
has
more
recently
been
recognized
by
secular
authorities
rights
and
its
1966
international
covenant
on
civil
and
political
rights
states
that
“
everyone
has
the
right
to
freedom
of
thought
conscience
and
religion
”
when
society
fails
to
acknowledge
conscience
as
a
human
right
and
does
not
provide
protections
for
individuals
to
follow
their
own
consciences
grave
conflicts
inevitably
result
either
people
will
heroically
obey
their
consciences
whatever
the
cost
or
they
will
lose
their
moral
integrity
with
all
the
devastating
effects
that
flow
from
this
on
society
at
large
tragically
many
catholics
possess
a
fatally
flawed
concept
of
conscience
denying
the
need
for
formation
in
the
truth
and
treating
mere
desire
as
an
absolute
conscience
is
indeed
a
decisionmaker
but
it
must
be
freely
submitted
to
the
law
of
god
to
which
it
is
a
witness
not
an
arbiter
the
error
lies
not
in
affirming
the
freedom
of
conscience
to
decide
but
in
misinterpreting
the
nature
of
such
freedom
freedom
of

must
be
at

examining
the
role
of
conscience
in
making
moral
decisions
q
i
disagree
with
some
of
the
teachings
of
the
catholic
church
i
was
once
told
that
i
don
t
have
to
follow
all
of
the
church
s
teachings
if
they
violate
my
conscience
but
still
i
m
not
sure
that
s
right
a
first
i
want
to
commend
you
for
asking
this
question
the
fact
that
asked
someone
who
ought
to
be
able
to
give
some
guidance
on
what
was
a
difficult
moral
question
in
response
they
seemed
to
get
an
answer
that
indicated
that
in
the
end
they
had
to
just
“
follow
their
conscience
”
i
can
understand
this
in
the
course
of
my
life
as
a
priest
i
have
right
decisionmaking
the
right
way
to
go
remained
foggy
and
difficult
“
when
he
listens
to
his
conscience
the
prudent
man
can
hear
god
speaking
”
—
ccc
1777
in
addition
the
catechism
of
the
catholic
church
teaches
“
when
he
listens
to
his
conscience
the
prudent
man
can
hear
god
speaking
”
ccc
1777
because
of
this
line
and
others
that
highlight
the
importance
of
conscience
it
is
tempting
to
take
the
default
position
of
“
whatever
you
feel
is
right
just
do
that
”
true
second
the
church
s
teaching
on
conscience
presumes
knowledge
of
the
moral
law
this
means
that
those
who
are
exercising
conscience
know
that
there
is
a
real
right
and
a
real
wrong
unfortunately
there
are
fewer
people
who
acknowledge
this
reality
this
places
us
in
a
unique
place
in
a
nationwide
study
on
the
moral
life
of
18
to
29yearolds
his
conclusion
was
that
this
age
group
generally
speaking
has
neither
the
vocabulary
nor
the
categories
to
make
moral
decisions
if
conscience
depends
on
principles
of
right
and
wrong
how
will
these
young
people
make
decisions
according
to
smith
they
base
their
decisions
on
feelings
but
conscience
is
not
a
feeling
the
catechism
clearly
states
that
conscience
“
formulates
its
judgments
according
to
reason
in
conformity
with
the
true
good
willed
by
the
wisdom
of
the
creator
”
ccc
1783
this
means
employing
one
s
mind
more
than
one
s
emotions
to
make
decisions
conscience
is
not
merely
some
feeling
we
get
it
is
the
critical
application
of
truth
to
the
present
issue
third
it
is
true
that
a
person
“
must
not
be
forced
to
act
contrary
to
his
conscience
nor
must
he
be
prevented
from
acting
according
to
his
conscience
especially
in
religious
matters
”
ccc
1782
but
this
does
not
mean
doing
whatever
pleases
me
the
church
s
constant
teaching
against
artificial
birth
control
in
the
document
“
humanae
vitae
”
many
couples
were
encouraged
to
dismiss
this
teaching
if
it
“
violated
their
conscience
”
unfortunately
as
a
result
many
couples
were
obliquely
encouraged
to
invite
a
sinful
practice
into
their
sexual
relationship
even
more
they
were
led
to
believe
that
they
because
that
is
all
this
comes
down
to
the
church
s
teaching
on
contraception
does
not
“
violate
”
a
person
s
conscience
unless
a
person
truly
believed
that
periodic
abstinence
in
marriage
was
an
evil
which
is
all
that
is
being
asked
for
through
natural
family
planning
then
there
is
no

issue
here
it
is
an
issue
of
a
not
knowing

the
specifics
of
freedom
of
conscience
can
be
complex
and
nuanced
and
are
often
misunderstood
abraham
kuyper
called
the
conscience
“
the
shield
of
the
human
person
the
root
of
civil
liberties
the
source
why
is
it
so
important
to
answer
that
question
let
s
begin
by
looking
at
what
the
conscience
is
and
is
not
what
is
“
conscience
”
definitions
of
conscience
vary
but
they
center
around
the
idea
of
what
someone
believes
to
be
right
and
wrong
the
conscience
is
a
moral
compass
that
helps
direct
people
s
actions
in
that
sense
conscience
is
personal
and
subjective
because
it
condemns
or
excuses
one
s
own
conduct
not
that
of
another
person
–
after
all
you
don
t
get
a
guilty
conscience
because
of
someone
else
s
behavior
however
conscience
is
also
based
on
an
objective
and
general
standard
the
bible
explains
that
the
conscience
is
given
by
god
to
both
christians
and
nonchristians
and
it
helps
people
apply
their
knowledge
of
right
and
wrong
to
their
behavior
both
past
actions
and
decisions
about
future
actions
the
new
testament
also
speaks
of
the
importance
of
having
a
good
conscience
by
following
its
direction
and
doing
what
is
right

christian
political
scientist
david
koyzis
in
his
book
we
answer
to
another
tells
a
story
about
the
milgram
experiment
which
relates
well
to
conscience
the
experiment
was
a
study
designed
to
look
at
how
people
respond
to
authority
the
experimenter
would
select
two
participants
and
assign
one
the
role
of
teacher
while
another
volunteer
would
be
given
and
answerable
to
a
higher
authority
ultimately
the
foundation
for
freedom
of
conscience
is
found
in
the
sovereignty
of
god
every
human
being
has
various
authorities
in
their
lives
such
as
parents
employers
church
leadership
or
civil
government
each
of
these
has
legitimate
authority
over
us
but
that
authority
is
also
limited
the
only
one
who
is
sovereign
over
the
conscience
is
god
and
if
another
authority
commands
us
to
do
what
we
believe
is
sin
–
what
we
believe
violates
how
god
wants
us
to
act
–
then
we
can
appeal
to
freedom
of
conscience
the
conscience
is
a
shield
that
protects
against
the
abuse
of
authority
and
points
instead
to
the
one
higher
authority
conscience
and
the
public
square
debates
around
conscience
are
becoming
increasingly

s

christians
who
are
being
pressured
to
violate
their
conscience
however
there
are
others
who
seek
the
same
protections
for
their
conscience
it
s
this
freedom
that
an
atheist

to

for

the
answer
to
the
questions
above
might

but
we

our
own

about

will
make
him
feel
guilty
more
than
if
he
fails
to
promote
life
as
he
believes
he
ought
when
the
conscience
commands
a
person
not
to
do
something
the
command
is
about
a
very
specific
action
alternatively
if
the
command
is
instead
to
act
on
something
good
there
are
often
various
ways
of
pursuing
that
good
conscience
and
the
church
because
of
sin
no
person
s
conscience
is
perfectly
aligned
with
what
god
commands
in
his
word
the
chart
below
is
based
on
one
from
a
helpful
book
titled
conscience
what
it
is
how
to
train
it
and
loving
those
who
differ
by
andrew
naselli
and
j
d
crowley
the
authors
used
it
to
explain
the
difference
between
two
people
s
consciences
and
how
they
compare
to
god
s
will
the
letters
within
the
chart
refer
to
different
rules
or
principles
of
right
and
wrong
both
arnold
and
zoey
have
added
rules
to
their
conscience
that
are
not
commanded
in
scripture
for
example
perhaps
arnold
has
a
history
of
alcohol
abuse
in
his
family
so
he
adds
letter
c
which
commands
him
arnold
s
belief
that
he
must
not
play
cards
or
any
games
involving
dice
arnold
and
zoey
have
also
both
failed
to
include
letter
b
in
their
conscience
perhaps
this
is
a
failure
to
consistently
honor
the
sabbath
day
and
their
consciences
no
longer
accuse
them
for
it
however
arnold
and
zoey
s
consciences
are
both
aligned
with
god
s
will
in
letters
j
through
m
where
they
have
rightly
applied
biblical
principles
and
commands
to
their
lives
and
consciences
the
natural
tendency
is
to
think
that
if
another
person
has
more
rules
than
us
they
are
legalistic
alternatively
if
they
have
fewer
rules
they
are
failing
to
live
as
christians
however
scripture
remains
the
standard
to
which
we
must
seek
to
align
our
conscience
the
conscience
can
easily
become
oversensitive
by
including
rules
that
are
not
matters
of
right
and
wrong
we
see
examples
of
the
pharisees
in
the
new
testament
who
created
additional
rules
for
the
sabbath
and
we
do
not
abide
by
similar
rules
on
the
sabbath
alternatively
conscience
can
become
desensitized
perhaps
you
use
or
tolerate
foul
language
that
would
have
shocked
you
a
decade
ago
or
you
consume
entertainment
that
you
would
have
been
ashamed
of
years
earlier
our
conscience
does
not
always
accurately
tell
us
what
is
sin
and
what
is
not
while
it
might
not
always
make
sense
to
follow
conscience
in
relation
to
other
authorities
we
have
a
duty
to
obey
it
because
we
cannot
commit
what
we
believe
is
sin
at
the
same
time
we
should
be
careful
when
dealing
with
the
consciences
of
other
people
in
1
corinthians
8
the
apostle
paul
talks
about
whether
believers
can
eat
meat
offered
to
idols
and
refers
to
consideration
for
brothers
and
sisters
with
a
weaker
conscience
so
if
we
believe
a
brother
or
sister
has
a
weaker
conscience
we
must
not
be
a
stumbling
block
to
them
and
cause
them
to
disobey
their
conscience
on
disputable
issues
we
may
realize
that
someone
has
a
weaker
conscience
and
we
can
discuss
the
biblical
principles
that
apply
or
perhaps
they
have
a
stronger
conscience
and
they
can
help
us
understand
where
our
conscience
is
not
aligned
to
scripture
again
conscience
is
not
meant
to
be
some
wishywashy
idea
where
everyone
can
believe
what
they
want
like
in
the
time
of
the
judges
of
israel
when
“
everyone
did
what
was
right
in
his
own
eyes
”
there
are
authorities
versus
our
callings
to
obey
what
god
demands
of
us
what
about
masking
vaccines
etc
both
within
the
public
square
and
the
church
christian
conscience
differs
on
these
issues
and
believers
can
have
biblical
arguments
for
why
they
think
god
commands
or
prohibits
different
actions
what
isn
t
conscience
some
of
us
might
react
to
the
idea
that
conscience
is
a
kind
of
subjective
belief
that
is
not
accountable
to
other
people
we
can
t
simply
say
“
well
what
s
right
for
you
isn
t
necessarily
right
for
me
”
conscience
is
not
merely
a
personal
preference
like
your
favorite
food
or
music
it
is
also
not
license
to
do
whatever
you
please
and
ignore
other
authorities
rather
freedom
of
conscience
refers
to
moral
beliefs
that
respect
a
limited
sphere
of
individual
authority
while
still
recognizing
other
legitimate
authorities
that
can
impose
obligations
on
us
as
such
the
conscience
is
not
unlimited
some
people
might
abuse
the
ability
to
claim
conscientious
objection
out
of
selfinterest
or
to
simply
justify
their
actions
authorities
such
as
the
civil
government
however
if
the
civil
government
or
other
authorities
limits
conscience
they
must
provide
good
justification
for
doing
so
and
seek
to
accommodate
conscientious
objectors
as
much
as
they
are
able
such
as
through
exemptions
for
freedom
of
conscience
abraham
kuyper
again
shows
the
importance
of
conscience
stating
that
“
ten
times
better
is
a
state
in
which
a
few
eccentrics
can
make
themselves
a
laughingstock
for
a
time
by
abusing
freedom
of
conscience
than
a
state
in
which
these
eccentricities
are
prevented
by
violating
conscience
itself
”
conclusion
ultimately
conscience
belongs
to
an
individual
and
is
accountable
to
god
however
it
should
also
be
rooted
in
biblical
commands
and
principles
increasingly
we
encounter
disagreements
in
the
church
about
various
issues
while
in
the
public
square
some
christians
jobs
are
threatened
because
the
state
fails
to
recognize
conscience
on
many
matters
christians
will
refuse
to
do
something
they
believe
is
evil
even
if
others
do
not
believe
the
action
is
wrong
the
church
has
an
according
to
moral
standards
based
on
the
will
and
sovereignty
of
god
wherever
we
find
ourselves
let
s
seek
to
say
“
i
myself
always
strive
to
have
a
conscience
without
offense
toward
god
and
men

the
best
way
to

these
and

questions
is

the

it
has
slightly
different

from

drew

on

st

legislative
conscience
the
judicial
understanding
of
conscience
continued
well
into
the
first
century
of
the
common
era
to
be
sure
paul
himself
continued
to
employ
it
at
the
same
time
d
arcy
credited
paul
with
introducing
in
addition
to
the
“
judicial
conscience
”
a
novel
conception
he
termed
the
“
legislative
conscience
”
it
is
not
difficult
to
see
why
the
earlier
judicial
conception
would
later
take
on
legislative
features
this
is
because
the
ability
to
judge
past
actions
as
either
right
or
wrong
—
and
by
the
law
they
are
a
law
for
themselves
even
though
they
do
not
have
the
law
they
show
that
the
requirements
of
the
law
are
written
on
their
hearts
their
consciences
also
bearing
witness
and
their
thoughts
sometimes
accusing

other

notice
that
according
to

conscience
syneidesis
is
not
the
ultimate
source
of
right

rather
the
foundation
of
right

is
the
objective
moral
law
which
is
both
“
written
on
men

”
and
borne
witness
to
by

one
might
say
then
that
the
objective
norm
of
morality
on
paul
s
account
is
the
moral
law
or
natural

conscience
however
might
be
termed

subjective
norm
this
is
made
clear
in
another
passage
from
st

he
is
addressing
the
question
of
whether
it
is
since
“

represent
according
to

it
represented

makes
us
aware
of

sinfulness
when

medieval
manuscripts
refer
to
this
psychological
property
as
synderesis
or
now
above
these
three
was
the
eagle
so
in
the
soul
they
say
above
the
other
three
elements
and
beyond
them
is
a
fourth
which
the
greeks
call
synderesis
this
is
that
spark
of
conscience
which
was
not
quenched
even
in
the
heart
of
cain
when
he
was
driven
out
of
paradise
this
it
is
that
which
makes
us
too
feel
our
sinfulness
by
sham
reason
it
is
natural
to
identify
synderesis
with
the
eagle
since
it
is
distinct
from
the
other
three
elements
and
corrects
them
when
they
err
however
we
also
see
that
this
conscience
conscientia
is
cast
down
in
some
people
who
have
neither
shame
nor
insight
regarding
their
offences
and
loses
its

however
he
does
admit
the
existence
of
those
who
are
shameless
and
lacking

insight
such
people
are
oblivious
to
their
offenses
because
according
to
jerome
their
conscience
conscientia
ceases
to
be
present
in
them
“
looses
its
place
”
if
synderesis
cannot
be
lost
but
conscience
can
then
it
seems
to
follow
that
they
are
separate

the

is
both
surprising
and
unsurprising
it
is
—
at
first
sight
anyway
—
surprising
because
lombard
does
not
discuss
conscience
or
synderesis
in
any
actual
detail
indeed
he
does
not
strictly
speaking
mention
the
terms
“
synderesis
”
or
“
conscience
”
at
all
what
he
does
is
merely
to
allude
to
jerome

commentary
on
ezekiel
in
the
context
of
discussing
the

in

sic
in

is
the
full
extent
of
his
treatment
of

still
that
was

that
it

in

to
scrutinize
the
original
passage
there
they
discovered
his
apparent
distinction
between
synderesis
and

which
in
turn
would
come
to
frame
the
parameters
of
the
later
medieval
debate
if

as
a
“

”
when
it
is
consciously
aware
of
some
personal
wrongdoing
whether
of
commission
or

it
“

a
judgement
that
some
act

finally
it
“

or
“

”
when
it
judges
that
some
past
action
was
either
morally
acceptable
or
it
was
not
although
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
conscience
in
the
first
sense
—
conscience
as
witness
—
can
function
as
an
application
of
knowledge
to
conduct
this
seems
less
problematic
in
the
second
and
third
senses
of
the
term
which
harken
back
to
the
legislative
and
judicial
senses
of

in

and

antiquity
respectively

in
any
case
an
example
of
the
way
in
which
conscience
applies
the
natural

—
whose
principles
are
apprehended
by
synderesis
—
is
articulated
in
aquinas

higher
reason
presents
this
minor
premise
“
sexual
intercourse
with
this
woman
is
forbidden
by
the
law
of
god
”
the
application
of
conscience
will
be
made
by
concluding
“
this
sexual

is
to
be
avoided
”

now
the
dictates
of
conscience
can
either
be
right
if
correctly
deduced
from
the
natural
law
or
wrong
if
they
are
incorrectly
deduced
the
dictates
of
the
former
are
the
product
of
a
“
correct
conscience
”
and
the
judgements
of
the
latter
are
the
result
of
an
“
erroneous
conscience
”
since
synderesis
is
infallible
the
main
source
of
an
erroneous
conscience
when
it
does
occur
is
the
agent
s
adoption
of
a
faulty
minor
premise
in
the
practical
syllogism

now
it
is
clear
that
we
have
an
obligation
to
follow
a
correct
conscience
since
to
do
so
contributes
to
achieving
our
final
end
but
what
of
an
erroneous
conscience
does
this
have
any
authority
for
aquinas
an
erring
conscience
also
binds
it
does
not
however
necessarily
excuse
as
hoffmann
puts
it
regardless
of
whether
my
action
is
objectively
good
evil
or
indifferent
conscience
binds
for
it
is
by
means
of
conscience
that
an
action
is
proposed
to
me
as
good
bad
or
indifferent

2012
260
refrains
according
to
aquinas
this
agent
although
he
does
what
is
objectively
right
nonetheless
sins
why
because
in
choosing
the
opposite
of
what
his
conscience
dictated
he
chose
to
do
something
he
believed
to
be
evil
and
choosing
what
is
subjectively
if
not
objectively
wrong
for
aquinas
is
a
sin
“
f
from
the
very
fact
that
thereto
becomes
evil
”
summa

q

a

corp
what
follows
from
this
is
that
conscience
whether
right
or
erroneous
always
binds
as
to
the
question
of
whether
an
erroneous
conscience
excuses
on
the
other
hand
that
depends
on
the
type
of
ignorance
that
causes
it
this
is
because
some
types
of
ignorance
render

ignorance
that
contributes
to
an
erroneous
conscience
that
is
in
any
way
voluntary
is
vincible
or
able
to
be
corrected
and
therefore
culpable
if
followed
this
generally
happens
where
the
agent
s
ignorance
of
the
unfortunately
as
we
have
seen
such
precepts
are
of
a
very
general
character
such
as
“
do
good
and
avoid
evil
”
for
such
general
knowledge
to
be
applicable
by
conscience
it
must
be
further
specified
this
further
specification
comprises
the
secondary
precepts
of
the
natural
law
which
are
closely
drawn
from
the
former
precepts
and
from
natural
a
final
problem
seems
to
emerge
are
we
not
according
to
aquinas
s
account
of
the
erroneous
conscience
left
with
the
possibility
of
a
moral
dilemma
for
if
we
have
an
obligation
to
always
follow
our
consciences
but
we
sometimes
sin
when
we
do
follow
them
then
it
seems
that
we
are
sometimes
put
into
a
double
bind
we
seem
that
is
to
sometimes
have
conflicting
obligations
so
that
regardless
of
what
we
do
we
sin
aquinas
s
solution
is
that
it
is
only
wrong
to
follow
a
conscience
that
is
in
a
state
of
vincible
ignorance
since
such
ignorance
is
by
definition
correctable
we
can
always
resolve
the
apparent
dilemma
by
choosing
to
put
aside
our
ignorance
as
far
as
acting
from
invincible
ignorance
is
concerned
we
are

william

new
directions
in
the
understanding
of
synderesis
and
conscience
with
the
fourteenthcentury
theologian
william
of
ockham
1285
–
1347
we
encounter
some
radically
new
developments
on
the
topics
of
synderesis
and
conscience
while
ockham
s
franciscan
predecessor
john
duns
scotus
had
disagreements
with
aquinas
about
the
nature
of
the
moral
law
scotus
fundamentally
agreed
with
the
dominican
in
viewing
synderesis
and
conscience
a
habit
and
an
act
of
the
practical
reason
respectively
whose
jobs
were
to
apprehend
the
basic
principles
of
morality
in
the
case
of
synderesis
and
to
apply
them
in
the
case
of
conscience

like
scotus
ockham
also
agrees
with
aquinas
in
several
crucial
respects
tradition
which
preceded
him
however
is
in
his
abandonment
of
the
concept
of
synderesis
and
in
his
unique
approach
to
the
invincibly
erroneous
conscience
it
is
difficult
to
know
for
certain
why
ockham
abandoned
the
concept
of
moral
epistemology
was
pinckaers
assumption
that
because
ockham
discarded
the
traditional
notion
of
synderesis
he
must
have
done
the
same
for
its
twin
concept
of
conscience
pinckaers
conceded
that
moral
principles
even
if
rooted
in
the
divine
will
still
need
to
be
applied
to
particular
situations
on
ockham
s
account
this
role
was
of
course
reserved
for
conscience
in
the
earlier
tradition
in
ockham
according
to
pinckaers
this
role
now
became
associated
with
practical
reason
and
prudence
pinckaers
1993
259
a
closer
reading
of
the
textual
evidence
suggests
that
ockham
very
much
made
use
of
the
traditional
concept
of
conscience
indeed
much
of
how
he
employed
the
concept
was
consistent
with
the
tradition
especially
as
articulated
by
aquinas
ockham
associates
the
dictates
of
practical
reason
for
example
with
judgements
of
conscience
he
is
also
emphatic
in
his
belief
that
rational
agents
have
an
absolute
obligation
to
follow
their
consciences
which
can
be
correct
or
erroneous
quaestiones

a
conscience
is
correct
when
it
is
in
accord
with
right
reason
it
is
erroneous
when
it
is
not
finally
an
erroneous
conscience
for
ockham
as
with
aquinas
is
either
in
a
state
of
vincible
—
voluntary
and
therefore
culpable
—
ignorance
or
in
a
state
of
invincible
—
or
involuntary
—
ignorance
where
conscience
is
in
a
state
of
vincible
ignorance
we
must
do
our
best
to
set
it
aside
in
all
these
cases
ockham
follows
the
tradition
with
one
exception
that
of
the
invincibly
erroneous
conscience
eardley
2013
94
–
98
the
state
in
which
the
agent
finds
himself
with
the
correct
universal
principles
but
nonculpably
errs
with
respect
to
his
grasp
of
the
circumstances
in
in
what
sense
does
ockham
depart
from
the
tradition
for
ockham
the
act
of
following
an
invincibly
erroneous
conscience
is
not
merely
excusable
as
it
was
for
aquinas
but
“
virtuous
and
meritorious
”
consider
the
following
example
from
ockham
while
walking
down
the
street
one
day
you
determine
that
although
it
is
theoretically
possible
that
he
could
be
fraud
this
seems
unlikely
for
ockham
you
are
obliged
in
this
instance
to
follow
your
conscience
and
indeed
you
do
it
turns
out
however
that
this
apparent
homeless
person
is
in
fact
a
very
wealthy
person
who
is
impersonating
a
beggar
for
ockham
in
following
your
conscience
you
are
not
merely
excused
or
absolved
of
your
error
but
your
ignorant
act
is
virtuous
and
indeed
regarded
by
god
as
meritorious
so
long
indeed
had
he
not
while
in
such
error
willed
to
help
that
person
he
would
have
performed
a
vicious
and
demeritorious
act
because
such
an
act
would
have
been
knowingly
elicited
against
conscience
and
against
nonculpable
reason
because
in
the
aforementioned
case
he
does
not
know
that
he
is
in
error
but
believes
that
he
possesses
right
what
is
motivating
ockham
s
novel
suggestion
even
aquinas
admitted
that
we
have
an
obligation
to
follow
our
consciences
whether
right
or
erroneous
when
we
do
not
do
so
according
to
aquinas
we
sin
of
course
when
our
consciences
are
in
a
state
of
voluntary
or
vincible
ignorance
we
also
have
a
duty
to
put
aside
our
error
otherwise
we
sin
it
is
obviously
not
possible
however
to
put
error
aside
in
the
case
of
invincible
ignorance
since
such
ignorance
is
by
definition
involuntary
accordingly
for
aquinas
we
are
obliged
to
follow
such
a
conscience
although
we
act
wrongly
in
such
cases
we
are
for
aquinas
excused
on
the
grounds
that
we
could
not
have
known
better
to
return
to
aquinas
s
such
an
act
might
be
considered
virtuous
much
less
meritorious
but
for
ockham
if
it
is
vicious
and
therefore
punishable
not
to
follow
an
invincibly
erroneous
conscience
then
merely
being
excused
for
following
it
when
we
are
under
a
moral
obligation
to
do
so
would
be
an
insufficient
reward
rather
it
should
logically
follow
that
it
is

given

disagree
on
which

whether
the
translation
should
depend

some
prefer
to
treat
the
