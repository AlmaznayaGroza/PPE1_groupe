GUILTY
CONSCIENCE/BAD
CONSCIENCE

[]
---------------
[]

Guilt
or
guilty
conscience
is
one
of
the
most
common
negative
or
sad
emotions
that
people
experience
almost
every
day
.


If
not
addressed
properly
,
a
guilty
conscience
can
destroy
your
relationship
,
steal
your
joy
,
your
happiness
,
and
even
your
future
.


Yet
,
the
majority
of
us
don
'
t
know
how
to
deal
with
it
in
a
healthy
way
.


According
to
the
German
philosopher
,
Friedrich
Nietzsche
(1844
-
1900)
.


A
guilty
conscience
can
push
a
person
to
become
very
cruel
and
do
horrible
things
as
a
result
.


Horrible
things
like
killing
,
committing
suicide
,
etc
.


Yet
,
just
like
any
other
emotions
,
there
'
s
not
a
clear
definition
for
a
"guilty
conscience"
.


So
to
better
understand
what
it
is
,
one
has
to
explore
the
concept
of
right
and
wrong
within
society
.



---------------
himself/herself
a
"get-out-jail-free
card"
in
this
universe
.


To
maintain
emotional
and
psychological
balance
,
it
is
necessary
to
experience
guilt
for
our
bad
behavior
or
actions
.


Besides
,
a
guilty
conscience
is
like
having
a
snooze
alarm
in
your
head
that
won
'
t
shut
off
until
it
is
addressed
and
it
has
to
be
addressed
in
a
healthy
way
.



If
not
addressed
properly
,
a
guilty
conscience
will
make
it
very
hard
for
you
to
think
straight
and
make
the
right
decisions
when
necessary
,
a
guilty
conscience
can
also
trigger
shame
,
anger
,
emptiness
,
and
in
many
cases
,
sabotage
your
entire
life
and
your
relationship
with
others
.



A
guilty
conscience
that
is
not
addressed
properly
will
also
make
you
become
very
paranoid
and
delusional
.


For
example
;
a
guilty
conscience
may
make
you
feel
that
everything
people
say
or
write
in
their
social
media
pages
is
about
you
and
then
consider
it
as
a
personal
attack
---------------
Such
behavior
will
eventually
throw
you
off
balance
emotionally
and
psychologically
and
make
you
a
good
candidate
for
anxiety
,
depression
,
or
much
worse
.


A
guilty
conscience
can
also
make
you
hate
and
punish
yourself
,
avoid
hearing
nor
seeing
the
person
that
you
'
ve
wronged
,
it
will
also
push
you
to
talk
negatively
about
that
person
in
order
to
---------------
more
harm
to
him/her
should
you
get
the
opportunity
.



How
to
Effectively
Deal
with
a
Guilty
Conscience
?



1)
The
first
step
in
dealing
with
a
guilty
conscience
is
always
to
surrender
to
the
truth
(Repentance)
.


This
means
to
stop
fighting
or
denying
your
guilt
because
the
more
you
deny
it
the
more
intense
the
---------------
environment
as
soon
as
you
can
.



3)
The
third
step
in
dealing
with
a
guilty
conscience
is
to
keep
your
emotions
and
behavior
in
check
at
all
time
.


There
'
s
nothing
more
embarrassing
for
a
person
than
not
being
unable
to
control
his/her
---------------
doing
things
it
will
repeat
itself
in
your
future
also
.


6)
The
sixth
and
final
step
is
to
always
seek
professional
help
(psychologist)
if
feel
like
you
'
re
overwhelmed
by
a
guilty
conscience
because
it
can
lead
to
more
severe
emotional
or
psychological
situations
,
even
suicide
.

Conscience
and
Moral
Rules
in
Adam
Smith

sympathy
impartial
spectator
duty
self-deceit
moral
sentiments
---------------

In
this
essay
I
explore
Adam
Smith’s
analysis
of
the
origins
of
conscience
and
general
moral
rules
in
The
Theory
of
Moral
Sentiments
.


I
argue
that
Adam
Smith
offers
a
distinction
between
moral
conscience
and
general
moral
rules
that
sidesteps
the
traditional
distinction
between
universal
and
relative
moral
standards
,
leading
to
a
fundamental
rethinking
of
the
problem
of
the
variability
of
moral
opinion
and
the
demands
of
moral
conscience
and
duty
.



Moral
Conscience

Like
the
thought
of
his
mentor
Francis
Hutcheson
and
of
his
friend
David
---------------
impartial
spectator
position
to
correct
for
any
bias
in
our
judgments
.



Smith’s
notion
of
moral
conscience
follows
directly
from
this
general
approach
.


He
believes
we
cultivate
a
moral
conscience
by
learning
to
view
ourselves
,
our
intentions
and
our
actions
from
a
position
of
impartial
spectatorship
.


From
this
position
,
we
cultivate
a
concern
with
praiseworthiness
and
blameworthiness
,
not
praise
and
blame
.


Being
virtuous
and
having
a
fully
developed
moral
conscience
for
Smith
represents
the
highest
stage
in
the
moral
development
of
an
individual
.



---------------
what
is
fit
and
proper
either
to
be
done
or
to
be
avoided”
(TMS
:
159)
.


The
specific
mechanism
by
which
these
rules
are
formed
is
considerably
different
from
the
cultivation
of
conscience
.


Take
the
emergence
of
negative
rules
or
commands
that
order
us
not
to
do
something
.


We
observe
another’s
behavior
and
disapprove
of
it
.


We
hear
others
express
similar
---------------
words
,
general
moral
rules
are
formed
out
of
our
judgments
of
particular
experiences
that
we
observe
in
conjunction
with
the
judgments
of
others
.


A
desire
for
praise
or
an
aversion
to
blame
,
not
the
moral
conscience’s
concern
for
praiseworthiness
or
aversion
to
blameworthiness
,
compels
us
to
develop
them
.


After
these
general
rules
are
formed
and
“universally
---------------
notion
of
the
universality
of
the
moral
standards
that
have
emerged
in
the
society
in
which
we
live
.


Finally
,
this
view
explains
how
tensions
arise
when
the
judgments
of
our
moral
conscience
might
be
displaced
or
,
at
least
,
come
into
conflict
with
the
general
rules
that
are
established
in
a
particular
society
and
to
which
we
feel
deep
sentimental
attachments
.


In
Smith’s
world
,
there
is
no
guarantee
that
the
conclusions
of
our
sense
of
moral
conscience
will
dovetail
neatly
into
our
sense
of
duty
.



---------------

Smith’s
conclusions
about
the
difference
between
the
dictates
of
moral
conscience
and
our
sense
of
duty
to
obey
general
rules
are
profound
.


Virtuous
individuals
guided
by
moral
conscience
cultivate
the
feelings
that
are
appropriate
to
particular
situations
.


For
example
,
when
confronted
with
the
benevolent
behavior
of
another
,
they
feel
gratitude
---------------
conduct
can
be
much
depended
upon”
(TMS
:
163)
.



The
Tension
between
Conscience
and
Duty

For
Smith
,
humans
are
subject
to
multiple
commands
in
ethics
,
some
stemming
from
the
dictates
of
conscience
and
others
from
duty
.


When
should
the
principle
of
duty
be
the
sole
principle
regulating
our
conduct
in
the
world
,
and
when
should
it
concur
with
other
motives
such
as
those
provided
by
moral
conscience
?


Conscience
and
duty
introduce
tension
into
Smith’s
understanding
of
moral
judgement
and
action
in
The
Theory
of
Moral
Sentiments
.


Understanding
that
tension
between
the
demands
of
conscience
and
duty
lies
at
the
heart
of
the
final
chapter
of
Part
VI
.



Some
moral
judgements
are
guided
primarily
by
moral
conscience
;
others
are
guided
by
general
rules
and
our
sense
of
duty
.


Given
the
characteristics
of
a
particular
passion
,
individuals
may
face
a
difficult
task
of
balancing
between
the
demands
of
conscience
and
of
duty
.


For
example
,
regarding
benevolent
and
social
sentiments
like
love
,
our
moral
judgements
and
actions
flow
naturally
from
our
benevolent
---------------
parliament
seeking
reelection
,
or
a
tradesman
seeking
a
special
job
,
must
be
grounded
,
at
least
in
part
,
by
the
passion
of
ambition
,
and
not
just
duty
or
conscience
,
for
successful
advancement
and
social
recognition
.



A
second
issue
that
follows
from
the
distinction
between
conscience
and
duty
involves
the
precision
and
exactness
of
the
general
moral
rules
themselves
.


Some
rules
are
clearer
and
more
important
to
society
than
---------------
Theory
of
Moral
Sentiments
and
remains
prone
to
misinterpretation
.


One
might
easily
argue
that
what
Smith
means
to
say
is
that
the
conclusions
of
conscience
are
the
general
laws
of
morality
backed
by
our
religious
sentiment
.


From
this
interpretation
,
conscience
can
easily
be
identified
as
“vicegerents
of
God”
that
reward
us
for
following
the
law
and
punish
us
for
breaking
it
.


If
my
reading
of
the
sharp
distinction
between
duty
and
conscience
is
correct
,
this
reading
is
seriously
mistaken
.


As
I
argue
above
,
our
general
rules
of
morality
are
generalizations
based
upon
our
observations
of
our
moral
judgments
in
conjunction
with
those
of
others
.


They
are
not
conclusions
of
our
moral
conscience
.


Conscience
deals
with
the
problem
of
praiseworthiness
,
duty
centers
upon
the
problem
of
praise
.


All
people
have
the
capacity
for
moral
generalization
.


All
people
do
not
have
a
highly
functioning
moral
sense
of
conscience
.


The
“vicegerents
of
God”
that
Smith
is
referring
to
are
not
just
the
sentiments
involved
with
conscience
.


They
encompass
all
our
moral
faculties
,
including
our
sense
of
propriety
and
impropriety
,
our
sense
of
merit
and
demerit
,
and
our
sense
of
duty
.



The
significance
of
the
distinction
between
conscience
and
duty
in
Smith’s
thought
is
revealed
most
clearly
at
the
end
of
Chapter
V
in
Part
III
.


Smith
emphasizes
that
while
he
wants
to
distinguish
between
duty
and
conscience
,
he
does
not
want
to
say
they
are
necessarily
antithetical
to
one
another
.


On
the
contrary
,
for
the
most
part
they
complement
one
another
.


He
comments
that
“the
general
rules
by
which
---------------

There
are
natural
limits
to
what
we
can
do
to
impose
the
teaching
of
our
consciences
upon
the
world
.


But
that
does
not
mean
that
we
must
deny
our
consciences
out
of
hand
.


Indignation
in
the
face
of
perceived
unfairness
is
a
natural
response
of
our
conscience
to
the
world
at
times
.


We
may
not
always
be
able
to
construct
the
world
in
the
way
that
we
wish
,
but
we
do
not
have
to
like
it
at
the
deepest
levels
of
our
being
.

present
at
the
heart
of
the
person
,
enjoins
him
at
the
appropriate
moment
to
do
good
and
to
avoid
evil
.


It
also
judges
particular
choices
,
approving
those
that
are
good
and
denouncing
those
that
are
evil
.

It
bears
witness
to
the
authority
of
truth
in
reference
to
the
supreme
Good
to
which
the
human
person
is
drawn
,
and
it
welcomes
the
commandments
.


When
he
listens
to
his
conscience
,
the
prudent
man
can
hear
God
speaking
.



1778
Conscience
is
a
judgment
of
reason
whereby
the
human
person
recognizes
the
moral
quality
of
a
concrete
act
that
he
is
going
to
perform
,
is
in
the
process
of
performing
,
or
has
already
completed
.


In
all
he
says
and
does
,
man
is
obliged
to
follow
faithfully
what
he
knows
to
be
just
and
right
.


It
is
by
the
judgment
of
his
conscience
that
man
perceives
and
recognizes
the
prescriptions
of
the
divine
law
:

Conscience
is
a
law
of
the
mind
;
yet
[Christians]
would
not
grant
that
it
is
nothing
more
;
I
mean
that
it
was
not
a
dictate
,
nor
conveyed
the
notion
of
responsibility
,
of
duty
,
of
a
threat
and
a
promise
.


.


.


.


[Conscience]
is
a
messenger
of
him
,
who
,
both
in
nature
and
in
grace
,
speaks
to
us
behind
a
veil
,
and
teaches
and
rules
us
by
his
representatives
.


Conscience
is
the
aboriginal
Vicar
of
Christ
.

1779
It
is
important
for
every
person
to
be
sufficiently
present
to
himself
in
order
to
hear
and
follow
the
voice
of
his
conscience
.


This
requirement
of
interiority
is
all
the
more
necessary
as
life
often
distracts
us
from
any
reflection
,
self-examination
or
introspection
:

Return
to
your
conscience
,
question
it
.


.


.


.


Turn

brethren
,
and
in
everything
you
do

see

as
your
witness
.

⁵¹

1780
The
dignity
of
the
human
person
implies
and
requires
uprightness
of
moral
conscience
.


Conscience
includes
the
perception
of
the
principles
of
morality
(synderesis)
;
their
application
in
the
given
circumstances
by
practical
discernment
of
reasons
and
goods
;
and
finally
judgment
about
concrete
acts
yet
to
be
performed
or
already
performed
.


the
truth
about
the
moral
good
,
stated
in
the
law
of
reason
,
is
recognized
practically
and
concretely
by
the
prudent
judgment
of
conscience
.


We
call
that
man
prudent
who
chooses
in
conformity
with
this
judgment
.



1781
Conscience
enables
one
to
assume
responsibility
for
the
acts
performed
.


If
man
commits
evil
,
the
just
judgment
of
conscience
can
remain
within
him
as
the
witness
to
the
universal
truth
of
the
good
,
at
the
same
time
as
the
evil
of
his
particular
choice
.


the
verdict
of
the
judgment
of
conscience
remains
a
pledge
of
hope
and
mercy
.


In
attesting
to
the
fault
committed
,
it
calls
to
mind
the
forgiveness
that
must
be
asked
,
the
good
that
must
still
be

What
is
a
Moral
Conscience
?




 
 According
to
the
Catechism
of
the
Catholic
Church
,
a
human

person
“has
in
his
heart
a
law
inscribed
by
God
,”
“calling
him

to
love
.

”
 This
is
a
person’s
moral
conscience
.


(#1776)


 
 In
their
document
Forming
Consciences
for
Faithful

Citizenship
,
the
U
.

S
.


bishops
said
"
Conscience
is
not
something

that
allows
us
to
justify
doing
whatever
we
want
,
nor
is
it
a

mere
‘feeling’
about
what
we
should
or
should
not
do
.


Rather
,

conscience
is
the
voice
of
God
resounding
in
the
human
heart
,

revealing
the
truth
to
us
and
calling
us
to
do
what
is
good

while
shunning
what
is
evil
.

”

 
 The
moral
conscience
urges
a
person “to
do
good
and
avoid

evil
;”
it
also
judges
particular
choices
,
approving
those
which

are
good
and
disapproving
those
which
are
evil
.


(Catechism
of

the
Catholic
Church
,
#1777)
 Our
conscience
enables
us
to

understand
the
principles
of
morality
,
decide
how
to
apply
those

principles
in
specific
circumstances
,
and
judge
the
moral
status

of
concrete
acts
.


(#1780)

 
 The
human
person
"has
the
right
to
act
in
conscience
and
in

freedom"
and
“must
always
obey
the
certain
judgment
of
his

conscience
.

”
(#1782
,
1790)

 
 The
Catechism
says
a
person’s
moral
conscience must
be

informed
and
enlightened
so
that
it
“formulates
its
judgments

according
to
reason
,
[and]
in
conformity
with
the
true
good"

How
to
Form
a
Moral
Conscience


Here
are
some
guidelines
for
how
to
form
a

particul-arly
in
a
situation
where
you
may
misunderstand
or

disagree
with
a
specific
truth
or
teaching
of
the
Church
:
---------------

conclusions
which
the
Church
officially
accepts
at
a
later
date
,

most
of
us
are
not
prophets
.



If
we
are
led
by
a
morally
responsible
conscience
to
believe
or

act
in
a
way
which
is
contrary
to
what
the
Church
teaches
at
the

present
time
,
we
should
continue
to
assume
that
the
Church
is
---------------

spiritual
life
of
the
Catholic
Church
,
being
careful
not
to
give

scandal
to
others
who
may
be

Being
a
leader
of
conscience

Leadership
---------------
Written
By
Jon
Mertz

What
does
a
leader
of
conscience
mean
?


It
begins
with
character
to
avoid
distorted
values
with
a
centered
focus
on
virtues
of
humanity
.


A
leader
of
conscience
engages
in
community
conversations
and
identifies
what
virtues
to
act
upon
in
the
choices
being
made
.



Sparked
by
Professor
Richard
Shell
'
s
new
book
,
The
Conscience
Code
,
I
explored
what
being
conscience
means
.


It
led
me
to
the
Ethics
Centre
,
a
non-profit
in
Sydney
,
Australia
.


The
Ethics
Centre
defines
conscience
as
:

---------------
2
.


How
a
person
decides
what
is
right

While
conscience
sounds
simple
,
it
quickly
gets
complicated
as
we
encounter
situations
in
which
variables
challenge
us
in
what
we
believe
and
what
we
decide
is
right
.


In
some
cases
,
our
conscientious
voice
gets
it
right
immediately
.


Other
times
,
confusion
reigns
.



Our
conscience
and
character
are
intimately
linked
.



Our
character
builds
specific
values
,
and
those
values
become
engraved
---------------
Virtues
are
"attitudes
,
dispositions
,
or
character
traits
that
enable
us
to
be
and
to
act
in
ways
that
develop
this
potential
[humanity]
.

"
The
development
of
humanity
is
crucial
when
considering
our
conscience
and
how
we
decide
what
to
do
in
challenging
situations
.



---------------
conversation
,
which
leads
to
a
focus
beyond
our
self-interests
.



Connecting
conscience
to
character
and
virtues
is
imperative
.



Too
often
lately
,
values
are
being
distorted
to
protect
a
power
base
rather
than
engaging
the
value
in
how
it
helps
humanity
.


Making
a
switch
to
virtues
can
raise
the
leadership
standard
.


A
new
conscience
accountability
checklist
:

-
After
our
conscience
determines
an
approach
,
ask
what
virtue

supports
the
decision
.



---------------

We
all
need
to
engage
in
conversations
about
virtues
and
begin
to
raise
the
standard
of
being
a
leader
of
conscience
.

How
Can
I
Have
a
Good
Conscience
?



[]
---------------
labors
on
this
podcast
!


My
question
is
one
that
I
have
struggled
with
for
over
two
decades
now
.


It’s
this
:
How
can
I
live
with
a
good
conscience
?


The
apostle
Paul
often
talks
about
the
conscience
,
and
how
specifically
a
‘good
conscience’
is
something
he
always
lived
with
,
apparently
even
before
he
became
a
Christian
(Acts
23
:1
;
24
:16)
.


We
also
see
that
a
‘good
conscience’
is
a
qualification
for
Christian
leaders
(1
Timothy
3
:9)
.


And
having
a
‘good
conscience’
is
an
important
goal
of
the
Christian
life
for
all
believers
(1
Timothy
1
:5
,
19)
.



“When
I
read
the
way
Paul
uses
the
word
conscience
in
these
contexts
,
it
seems
like
he’s
saying
it
means
to
be
‘presently
walking
in
obedience
to
everything
God
has
revealed
to
him
.

’
He
does
not
seem
to
mean
that
he’s
---------------
for
forgiveness
(according
to
1
John
1
:8–10
and
Matthew
6
:12)
.



“All
this
means
that
I
literally
never
have
a
good
conscience
—
I
am
always
aware
of
important
ways
in
which
I
presently
need
to
repent
and
become
more
holy
.


So
if
a
good
conscience
is
a
basic
Christian
issue
,
and
Paul
always
had
one
,
yet
I
will
always
know
of
sin
areas
in
my
life
—
and
if
I
have
to
pray
daily
for
forgiveness
—
how
could
I
,
or
any
Christian
for
that
matter
,
ever
attain
to
a
good
conscience
?

”

Well
,
Arnaldo
has
done
his
homework
.


He
laid
out
texts
in
that
question
,
---------------

I
feel
the
force
of
the
question
.


Experientially
,
walking
in
a
good
conscience
is
not
easy
for
me
since
I
share
Arnaldo’s
deep
awareness
of
my
ongoing
,
indwelling
sin
.


That’s
Paul’s
term
in
Romans
7
:17
,
20
,
23
.


We
all
have
remaining
corruption
and
indwelling
sin
.


The
more
keenly
you
are
aware
of
that
,
the
more
you
will
feel
embattled
at
the
level
of
needing
a
good
conscience
.




“The
whole
New
Testament
does
assume
that
in
this
life
,
nobody
attains
---------------
to
the
publican
who
said
,
“God
,
be
merciful
to
me
,
a
sinner
!

”
over
against
the
Pharisee
who
was
thanking
God
that
he
had
such
a
clear
conscience
—
and
he
said
that
the
one
who
cried
out
for
mercy
about
his
sin
went
down
to
his
house
justified
(Luke
18
:10–14)
.


It
was
good
for
him
to
own
his
sinfulness
,
not
to
say
,
“Oh
,
it
doesn’t
exist
.


I’ve
got
a
clear
conscience
.


I
don’t
have
any
sin
to
repent
of
.

”
We
feel
the
force
.



Now
,
I
think
1
John
1
is
not
only
especially
illuminating
but
gives
us
a
category
alongside
good
conscience
that
may
provide
the
solution
.



Walking
in
the
Light
---------------
cleansing
and
forgiveness
.




“A
good
conscience
is
virtually
the
same
as
walking
in
the
light
.

”

Here’s
what
I
would
draw
from
this
if
I
use
the
category
of
conscience
to
explain
this
passage
:
a
good
conscience
is
virtually
the
same
as
walking
in
the
light
.


Christians
should
be
able
to
say
,
“I’m
walking
in
the
light
,”
and
mean
it
,
and
mean
by
that
,
“I’m
walking
in
a
good
conscience
.

”
Which
means
I
don’t
think
we
should
equate
having
a
bad
conscience
with
having
indwelling
sin
.


Now
,
that
may
be
the
most
important
thing
I
say
,
Tony
.


Let
me
say
it
again
.


I’m
inferring
,
from
what
I’ve
said
from
1
John
1
,
that
having
a
bad
conscience
is
not
the
same
as
having
indwelling
sin
.


They’re
not
the
same
.



Our
Clear
Conscience

That’s
my
basic
answer
to
Arnaldo’s
question
.


He
feels
that
as
long
as
he
is
aware
of
the
reality
of
indwelling
sin
,
as
in
Romans
7
,
he
cannot
have
a
good
conscience
.


Now
,
if
that
were
true
,
I
don’t
think
Paul
could
ever
have
a
good
conscience
,
but
he
clearly
says
he
does
have
a
good
conscience
.



“I
thank
God
whom
I
serve
,
as
did
my
ancestors
,
with
a
clear
conscience”
(2
Timothy
1
:3)
.


He
expects
the
elders
of
the
church
to
do
the
same
:
“They
must
hold
the
mystery
of
the
faith
with
a
clear
conscience”
(1
Timothy
3
:9)
.


That’s
the
goal
for
all
Christians
.


According
to
1
Timothy
1
:5
,
“The
aim
of
our
charge
is
love
that
issues
from
a
pure
heart
and
a
good
conscience
and
a
sincere
faith
.

”
I
don’t
think
we
should
equate
a
good
conscience
with
sinless
perfection
in
this
life
,
nor
equate
a
bad
conscience
with
the
presence
of
indwelling
sin
or
remaining
corruption
.


Rather
,
a
clear
or
a
good
conscience
is
like
walking
in
the
light
.




If
we
walk
in
the
light
,
as
he
is
in
the
light
,
we
have
fellowship
---------------

I
think
both
Paul
and
John
inherited
this
concept
of
ongoing
,
indwelling
sin
that
nevertheless
coexists
with
a
good
conscience
from
the
Psalms
in
the
Old
Testament
.



---------------
not
the
only
place
in
the
Psalms
;
there
are
a
lot
of
psalms
that
distinguish
the
righteous
and
the
wicked
.


The
righteous
are
really
righteous
:
they’re
walking
in
the
light
;
they
have
a
good
conscience
.


In
David’s
mind
,
there
is
an
integrity
and
an
uprightness
that
is
aware
of
indwelling
corruption
that
breaks
out
at
times
in
sins
.


It
does
.


And
---------------
and
used
language
that
way
.


John
used
the
language
of
walking
in
the
light
though
we
are
imperfect
.


Paul
used
the
language
of
walking
in
a
good
conscience
though
we
are
imperfect
.


I
think
for
all
of
them
(David
,
Paul
,
John)
,
the
key
that
enabled
them
to
think
this
way
is
that
they
all
knew
God
had
made
a
way
for
all
their
sins
to
be
passed
over
—
---------------

I
do
think
Arnaldo
is
right
to
say
that
justification
by
faith
is
not
the
same
as
walking
in
a
good
conscience
,
or
walking
in
the
light
,
or
having
integrity
.


Those
are
real
character
traits
,
not
imputed
righteousness
.


Nevertheless
,
it’s
the
covering
of
all
their
sins
by
the
blood
of
Jesus
that
enables
them
to
look
upon
their
conscience
and
walking
and
integrity
with
thankfulness
and
confidence
that
it
really
will
be
accepted
by
God
as
good
,
though
imperfect
.


---------------
No
,
no
,
no
.


That
is
not
the
time
to
say
that
with
your
kids
listening
,
and
your
wife
listening
,
and
the
whole
church
wondering
.


What
you
need
to
say
at
that
moment
is
this
:
“My
conscience
is
clear
.


I
am
a
man
of
integrity
.


I
have
walked
in
the
light
.


I
have
never
touched
that
woman
or
any
woman
sexually
besides
my
wife
.


This
accusation
is
not
true
.

”
---------------
I
think
that
is
one
of
the
implications
of
what
Paul
is
saying
when
he
says
to
the
elders
and
to
the
rest
of
us
that
we
should
walk
in
a
good
conscience
—
or
as
John
would
say
,
walk
in
the
light
.

What
to
Know


Though
they
sound
similar
,
conscience
is
a
noun
referring
to
the

awareness
that
one
'
s
actions
are
right
or
wrong
,
as
in
one
'
s
"guilty

conscience
,"
while
conscious
is
an
adjective
meaning
"awake"
or

"alert
.

"
If
you
were
asleep
you
would
be
"unconscious
.

"
To
keep
them

straight
,
remember
to
stay
conscious
of
what
your
conscience
is

telling
you
to
do
.



As
conscientious
lexicographers
,
we
are
conscious
of
the
occasional
mix-up
of
the
words
conscience
and
conscious
.


Here
are
some
examples
that
caught

If
you
stopped
to
double-check
if
conscience
or
conscious
was
actually
being
used
incorrectly
in
any
of
the
above
examples
,
this
article
will
help
you
to
readily
differentiate
the
words
and
use
them
with
confidence
in
the
future—since
,
honestly
,
there
were
no
trick
examples
.


And
if
wrongly
using
conscience
in
place
of
conscious
,
or
vice
versa
,
has
never
been
on
your
conscience
,
we
encourage
you
to
read
on
anyways
.


We
discuss
word
history
and
grammar
,
and
an
orthopteran
insect
.



---------------
It
'
s
our
moral
obligation
to
help
.



Conscience
and
conscious
derive
from
the
same
Latin
roots—the
prefix
com-
("with
,"
"together
,"
"jointly")
and
the
verb
scire
("to
know")
,
and
the
combination
,
conscire
,
means
"to
be
aware
of
guilt"—and
both
relate
to
a
state
of
awareness
,
the
first
of
a
moral
awareness
and
the
second
of
a
physical
or
mental
wakefulness
in
which
a
person
is
aware
of
their
surroundings
.


English
speakers
are
first
made
aware
of
conscience
in
the
13th
century
,
and
conscious
in
the
16th
.



Conscience
and
conscious
have
similar
pronunciations
,
which
,
for
some
,
causes
confusion
.


(Their
first
syllables
are
pronounced
the
same
,
and
they
both
contain
a
middle
\sh\
sound
.

)
For
those
who
hesitate
on
which
to
use
,
learning
the
words
'

suffixes
and
their
meanings
and
also
the
words
'

parts
of
speech
might
be
the
best
approach
in
differentiating
them
.


Conscience
,
having
the
noun
suffix
-ence
,
meaning
"quality
or
state
,"
is
,
well
,
a
noun
,
and
conscious
,
having
the
adjective
suffix
-ous
,
meaning
"having
,"
is
an
adjective
.



What
Does
Conscience
Mean
?



The
noun
conscience
refers
to
a
state
of
awareness
or
a
sense
that
one
'
s
actions
or
intentions
are
either
morally
right
or
wrong
,
along
with
a
feeling
of
obligation
to
do
the
right
thing
.


Cartoons
often
personify
the
conscience
as
a
proverbial
angel/devil
pair
who
talk
into
the
ear
of
an
indecisive
character
,
encouraging
him
or
her
to
follow
either
a
path
of
moral
virtue
or
of
moral
corruption
.


In
the
Walt
Disney
movie
Pinocchio
,
metaphorically
,
the
conscience
is
the
dapper
talking
cricket
,
named
Jiminy
Cricket
,
whose
maxim
"always
let
your
conscience
be
your
guide"
he
teaches
the
title
character
,
a
marionette
who
is
magically
brought
to
life
and
becomes
a
real
human
boy
after
proving
himself
brave
,
truthful
,
and
selfless
(after
listening
to
his
conscience)
.


Some
examples
of
the
noun
conscience
are
:


You
should
decide
what
to
do
according
to
your
own
conscience
.




Her
conscience
was
bothering
her
,
so
she
finally
told
the
truth
.




I
cannot
do
anything
that
is/goes
against
my
conscience
.




He
could
not
in
good
conscience
allow
this
situation
to
continue
.




I
have
to
tell
you
the
truth
because
I
don
'
t
want
this
on
my

conscience
any
longer
.



What
Does
Conscious
Mean
---------------
environmentally
conscious
activist
.


Additionally
,
conscious
can
modify
an
act
or
decision
that
is
done
deliberately
(and
one
that
might
very
well
result
in
conscious
guilt
or
a
guilty
conscience)
.



Hopefully
,
you
are
now
fully
(or
at
least
semi-)
conscious
of
the
differences
in
using
conscience
and
conscious—the
most
essential
one
being
that
conscience
is
a
noun
and
conscious
is
an
adjective
,
which
describes
nouns
.


Keep
in
mind
that
whenever
you
are
in
a
difficult
situation
,
you
should
be
conscious
about
what
your
conscience
is
telling
you
.


Your
conscience
will
help
you
make
moral
,
just
,
and
fair
decisions
.


As
for
remembering
the
spelling
of
the
noun
:
conscience
contains
the
word
science
(also
a
noun)
,
and
as
science
tells
us
how
the
forces
of
nature
and
the
universe
behave—or
should—the
conscience
tells
us
how
we
should
behave—or
should
.

Reading
the
philosophical
and
historical
literature
on
conscience
,
the
first
thing
one
would
notice
is
the
variety
of
meanings
and
psychological
and
ethical
assessments
of
the
concept
.


Different
philosophical
,
religious
and
common
sense
approaches
to
conscience
have
emphasized
different
aspects
of
the
following
,
broad
characterization
:
through
our
individual
conscience
,
we
become
aware
of
our
deeply
held
moral
principles
,
we
are
motivated
to
act
upon
them
,
and
we
assess
our
character
,
our
behavior
and
ultimately
our
self
against
those
principles
.


The
resulting
more
specific
understandings
of
conscience
will
be
presented
in
the
sections
below
.


On
any
of
these
accounts
,
conscience
is
defined
by
its
inward
looking
and
subjective
character
,
in
the
following
sense
:
conscience
is
always
knowledge
of
ourselves
,
or
awareness
of
moral
principles
we
have
committed
to
,
or
assessment
of
ourselves
,
or
motivation
to
act
that
comes
from
within
us
(as
opposed
to
external
impositions)
.


This
inward
looking
and
subjective
character
of
conscience
is
also
reflected
in
the
etymological
relation
between
the
notion
of
“conscience”
and
that
of
consciousness
.


Only
after
the
17^(th)
Century
did
“consciousness”
start
to
be
used
with
a
distinct
meaning
referring
to
the
psychological
and
phenomenal
dimension
of
the
mind
,
---------------
shift
,
see
Jorgensen
2014)
.



The
term
“conscience”
translates
the
Latin
“conscientia”
,
which
refers
to
sharing
“knowledge”
(scientia)
“with”
(con-)
,
and
which
in
turns
translates
the
equivalent
Greek
term
suneidenai
(see
Pierce
1955
and
---------------
whom
that
knowledge
is
shared
with
.


However
,
the
concept
has
traditionally
been
used
to
refer
to
moral
knowledge
(we
talk
indifferently
of
conscience
and
moral
conscience)
that
is
shared
with
oneself
.


This
reference
to
the
self
does
not
rule
out
that
the
source
of
the
morality
in
question
be
external
to
the
self
.


For
example
,
it
might
---------------
or
of
one’s
upbringing
,
as
in
the
Freudian
theory
of
the
Super-Ego
.


Reference
to
the
self
indicates
that
,
from
a
psychological
point
of
view
,
conscience
involves
introspection
,
awareness
of
one’s
behavior
,
and
self-assessment
.


As
we
shall
see
,
although
these
aspects
often
overlap
,
they
are
psychologically
and
conceptually
distinct
functions
.


---------------
ideal
observer
(for
instance
a
god
,
an
imagined
moral
model
,
an
impartial
spectator)
.


Unfortunately
,
debates
in
which
appeals
to
conscience
are
often
made—for
example
the
debate
about
conscientious
objection
in
health
care—are
often
characterized
by
a
lack
of
clarity
as
to
what
it
exactly
is
that
we
are
talking
about
when
we
talk
about
conscience
,
and
therefore
about
what
exactly
people
are
claiming
when
they
put
forward
a
“conscientious
objection”
to
,
for
example
,
abortion
.


In
what
sense
does
abortion
violate
the
conscience
of
a
committed
Catholic
doctor
?


And
is
conscience
amenable
to
reason
and
public
discussion
,
or
are
appeals
to
conscience
ultimately
based
on
intuitions
and
private
morality
?


In
what
sense
is
a
conscientious
choice
different
from
a
mere
moral
preference
?


The
notion
of
conscience
is
in
need
of
conceptual
clarification
.



This
entry
will
expound
the
main
features
of
the
notion
of
conscience
as
it
is
used
in
philosophical
discussion
,
religious
teaching
and
in
common
language
alike
.


The
perspective
adopted
here
will
be
theoretical
,
rather
---------------
examples
are
drawn
from
Christian
source
.


The
entry
is
structured
around
four
possible
,
but
not
mutually
exclusive
,
ways
of
conceptualizing
conscience
.


These
will
be
preceded
by
an
introductory
section
outlining
the
pluralistic
,
morally
neutral
and
subjective
nature
of
the
concept
of
conscience
.


The
four
main
aspects
of
conscience
that
will
be
described
are
the
following
.


Section
2
discusses
conscience
as
a
faculty
for
self-knowledge
and
self-assessment
.


Section
3
presents
the
epistemic
aspect
of
conscience
that
allows
the
formation
of
moral
beliefs
,
distinguishing
the
different
possible
sources
of
moral
principles
that
inform
such
beliefs
.


In
section
4
,
conscience
will
be
described
as
a
motivational
force
or
as
the
source
of
our
sense
of
duty
,
which
already
presupposes
a
body
of
moral
knowledge
or
of
moral
beliefs
.


Finally
,
section
5
will
focus
on
conscience
understood
as
the
body
of
personal
core
and
self-identifying
moral
beliefs
which
is
often
taken
to
be
the
basis
of
moral
integrity
(Fuss
1964
;
Wicclair
2011)
and
of
our
sense
of
personal
identity
(Childress
1979)
.


As
discussed
in
section
6
,
this
last
approach
to
conscience
is
often
used
with
a
political
function
to
advocate
freedom
of
thought
and
action
in
liberal
democratic
societies
,
for
example

Conscience
as
pluralistic
,
neutral
and
subjective

The
concept
of
conscience
does
not
bear
any
connection
with
any
particular
substantial
moral
view
(Broad
1940)
.


The
voice
of
conscience
might
suggest
different
principles
and
different
behaviors
to
different
people
.


In
other
words
,
there
is
no
psychological
or
conceptual
relation
between
conscience
and
any
particular
moral
belief
.


However
,
as
will
be
explained
below
,
in
the
Catholic
tradition
the
idea
of
an
erroneous
conscience
is
sometimes
used
to
refer
to
conscience
that
fails
to
recognize
the
true
moral
laws
which
it
is
naturally
predisposed
to
“witness”
within
our
heart
.


As
for
secular
accounts
of
conscience
,
the
independence
of
the
notion
of
conscience
from
any
substantial
moral
content
can
be
understood
in
three
senses
.



First
,
conscience
is
a
pluralistic
notion
.


To
say
that
a
person
acted
with
conscience
or
that
something
violates
someone’s
conscience
does
not
entail
anything
about
what
this
act
consists
of
or
what
this
person’s
moral
values
are
(although
it
might
tell
us
that
conscience
is
itself
a
value
this
person
holds
dear)
.


To
use
a
metaphor
,
conscience
is
like
an
empty
box
that
can
be
filled
with
any
type
of
moral
content
.


As
put
by
Strohm
,


conscience
has
what
might
be
called
an
“identity
problem”—that
it

possesses
no
fixed
or
inherited
content
of
its
own
,
and
that
it
can
be

hailed
and
mobilized
in
defence
of
one
position
or
equally
in
defence
---------------
For
example
,
while
some
health
practitioners
raise
“conscientious”
objection
to
abortion
and
refuse
to
provide
the
service
,
someone’s
conscience
might
demand
the
exact
opposite
,
i
.

e
.


,
to
perform
abortions
in
order
to
respect
what
is
conscientiously
believed
to
be
a
woman’s
right
(Joffe
1995)
.



Second
,
conscience
is
typically
a
morally
neutral
concept
.


Appealing
to
conscience
does
not
usually
add
anything
to
the
moral
justification
of
any
particular
conduct
or
principle
.


Unless
one
is
committed
to
the
relativistic
idea
that
your
belief
(or
your
conscience)
about
x
being
right
or
wrong
is
what
makes
it
right
or
wrong
for
you
to
do
x
(Foot
1979)
,
something
is
not
made
morally
better
or
worse
,
acceptable
or
unacceptable
,
simply
by
being
a
matter
of
conscience
.


For
example
,
the
morality
of
abortion
has
nothing
to
do
with
abortion
being
conscientiously
opposed
by
some
health
practitioners
or
conscientiously
supported
by
others
.


This
neutrality
does
not
exclude
,
however
,
that
an
appeal
to
conscience
can
represent
itself
as
a
reason
for
respecting
someone’s
moral
views
,
for
example
a
reason
for
granting
someone
a
right
to
object
to
carrying
out
certain
activities
.


While
appeals
to
conscience
do
not
typically
provide
any
moral
reason
in
defense
of
a
certain
moral
stance
(unless
one
is
a
relativist)
,
they
might
ground
political
reasons
for
respecting
individuals’
moral
beliefs
,
such
as
for
example
tolerance
or
pluralism
.



Finally
,
conscience
only
concerns
the
subjective
dimension
of
morality
.


Even
assuming
that
there
are
ethical
values
that
,
in
some
sense
,
can
be
considered
objective
,
conscience
only
refers
to
what
individuals
believe
,
independently
of
any
external
,
objective
proof
or
justification
.


And
when
people
state
what
they
subjectively
and
conscientiously
believe
,
they
acknowledge
that
other
people
might
(and
probably
will)
subjectively
and
conscientiously
hold
different
moral
views
.


Thus
,
when
I
say
that
abortion
violates
my
conscience
,
I
am
not
saying
(although
I
might
be
thinking)
that
abortion
is
morally
wrong
by
some
objective
standard
,
and
I’m
not
necessarily
trying
to
convince
---------------
standard
.



These
three
aspects
related
to
the
independence
of
conscience
from
particular
substantial
moral
views
explain
why
appeals
to
conscience
to
justify
one’s
behavior
are
usually
made
with
the
expectation
that
no
further
reason
for
the
behavior
in
question
be
required
.


As
put
by
Childress
,
when
an
agent
appeals
to
her
conscience
,


[u]sually
the
agent
has
given
up
the
attempt
to
convince
others
of
the
---------------

rightness
.

1979
:

Conscience
as
self-knowledge
and
self-assessment

When
we
talk
about
conscience
,
we
often
refer
to
reflection
about
ourselves
as
moral
persons
and
about
our
moral
conduct
.


Through
conscience
we
examine
ourselves
,
as
if
we
were
our
own
inner
judge
.


The
image
of
an
individual
split
into
two
persons
,
one
who
acts
and
the
other
who
observes
the
former’s
conduct
,
reflects
the
original
conception
of
“conscience”
in
the
Greek
world
,
at
least
from
the
5^(th)
century
BCE
(Sorabji
2014
:
12)
.


But
such
self-
knowledge
may
also
be
thought
of
as
shared
with
others
inside
of
us
,
such
as
God(s)
or
other
---------------
actions
(Kant
1797)
.



The
role
of
conscience
in
this
sense
is
not
that
of
merely
gaining
knowledge
about
our
behavior
or
character
.


The
knowledge
in
question
is
typically
(though
,
as
explained
below
,
not
always)
the
ground
for
a
moral
assessment
by
conscience
.


When
observing
one’s
behavior
,
conscience
is
more
like
a
judge
(or
sometimes
it
is
identified
with
the
judgment
itself)
than
like
a
disinterested
observer
.


Thus
,
for
instance
,
the
impartial
spectator
with
which
Adam
Smith
identified
conscience
,
inspired
by
the
Stoic’s
notion
of
conscience
as
an
imagined
admired
philosopher
judging
one’s
conduct
,
is
not
a
morally
and
emotionally
neutral
observer
,
but
generates
a
sentiment
of
approval
or
disapproval
of
oneself
(Smith
1759
and
discussion
in
Raphael
2007
:
34)
.


Even
in
the
Catholic
view
,
where
the
main
characterization
of
conscience
is
that
of
a
witness
of
God’s
law
in
our
hearts
(as
described
in
section
3)
,
conscience
is
also
presented
as
“a
moral
judgment
about
man
and
his
actions
,
a
judgment
either
of
acquittal
or
condemnation”
(John
Paul
II
1993
:
59)
.


Analogously
,
in
the
Kantian
view
,
conscience
is
conceived
of
as
an
inner
court
(Wood
2008
:
184)
:
it
is
moral
self-awareness
that
allows
one
to
apply
the
moral
law
suggested
by
practical
reason
to
our
moral
conduct
,
and
to
judge
whether
we
have
complied
with
the
moral
law
.


As
Kant
defines
it
in
the
Metaphysics
of
Morals
,
conscience
is


practical
reason
holding
the
human
being’s
duty
before
him
for
his
---------------

consciousness
of
an
internal
court
in
man
.


(Kant
1797
[1991
:
189])

This
understanding
of
conscience
as
an
inner
court
is
well
illustrated
by
the
story
of
Huckleberry
Finn
in
Mark
Twain’s
famous
novel
(Twain
1884
;
Bennett
1974)
.


In
a
well-known
episode
of
the
novel
,
Huck
feels
guilty
and
blameworthy
for
having
helped
his
slave
friend
Jim
to
escape
from
his
owner
Miss
Watson
.


Blame
does
not
come
from
some
external
moral
authority
,
but
it
is
a
verdict
issued
by
conscience
according
to
its
moral
laws
.


The
bites
of
conscience
in
Huck’s
case
were
caused
by
a
tension
between
his
feelings
supporting
what
he
did
and
the
principles
he
had
inherited
from
his
social
environment
.


At
the
time
when
the
novel
---------------
helping
slaves
run
away
meant
depriving
someone
of
her
private
property
.


This
was
the
“law”
(metaphorically
speaking)
against
which
Huck’s
conscience
assessed
his
behavior
.



This
story
illustrates
another
interesting
feature
of
conscience
as
a
faculty
for
self-assessment
,
i
.

e
.


,
the
asymmetry
between
our
confidence
in
the
validity
of
the
moral
standards
provided
by
our
own
conscience
and
our
confidence
in
the
validity
of
the
standards
provided
other
people’s
conscience
.


Huck
thinks
that
what
he
did
was
wrong
and
that
it
rendered
him
blameworthy
in
spite
of
his
feelings
,
because
he
thinks
that
his
own
conscience
provides
a
correct
moral
standard
,
i
.

e
.


,
a
standard
that
he
endorses
even
if
some
of
his
feelings
or
beliefs
indicate
otherwise
.


This
seems
to
reflect
our
common
way
of
relating
to
our
own
conscience
:
we
try
to
adjust
our
feelings
and
judgments
to
our
conscience’s
standard
,
rather
than
vice
versa
.


However
,
the
same
does
not
hold
when
we
talk
of
other
people’s
conscience
,
which
is
usually
taken
to
indicate
their
subjective
moral
standard
and
does
not
imply
that
we
are
endorsing
it
.


This
asymmetry
suggests
that
there
is
no
conceptual
relation
between
the
notion
of
conscience
per
se
and
the
notion
of
an
objective
or
correct
moral
standard
;
rather
,
it
stresses
once
more
the
fact
that
conscience
has
merely
to
do
with
one’s
private
morality
and
one’s
commitment
to
her
own
morality
.



Consistently
with
this
understanding
of
conscience
as
self-knowledge
and
self-assessment
,
it
has
been
suggested
by
some
that
psychopaths—i
.

e
.


,
pathological
subjects
who
display
antisocial
behavior
and
systematically
act
without
regard
to
what
they
consider
to
be
right
or
wrong—can
be
said
to
lack
conscience
(Hare
1999)
.


For
instance
,
according
to
Vujošević
(2015)
,
in
psychopaths
the
link
between
moral
knowledge
or
beliefs
and
self-directed
feelings
of
condemnation
(e
.

g
.


,
guilt)
is
---------------

As
mentioned
above
in
this
section
,
when
expressing
itself
through
self-evaluative
feelings
,
conscience
might
be
conceived
of
as
either
constituted
by
such
feelings
(Fuss
1964)
or
as
occasioning
them
(Broad
1940)
.



In
the
former
sense
(conscience
as
constituted
by
self-evaluative
feelings)
,
the
feeling
is
an
essential
part
of
conscience
.


Conscience
in
this
case
is
better
conceived
not
as
a
judge
who
issues
sentences
,
but
as
a
feeling
with
cognitive
content—where
the
cognitive
content
concerns
---------------
cases
,
the
negative
feeling
informs
me
that
what
I
am
doing
or
am
contemplating
doing
is
wrong
(according
to
my
own
moral
parameters)
.


In
the
latter
sense
(conscience
as
occasioning
self-evaluative
feelings)
,
the
inner
judge
,
when
in
tension
with
one’s
conduct
,
generates
negative
self-directed
feelings
(Mill
1861
:
ch
3)
.


For
instance
,
in
Freud
the
“Super-Ego”—the
part
of
our
personality
that
attends
to
prohibitions
,
inhibitions
and
moral
constraints—takes
“the
form
of
conscience”
to
exercise
its
control
over
one’s
impulses
and
instincts
by
producing
negative
evaluative
feelings
towards
the
individual
,
such
as
aggressiveness
towards
the
Ego
and
guilt
(Freud
1929
[2000
:
30])
.


As
we
shall
see
below
in
section
4
,
these
self-directed
negative
feelings
play
an
essential
role
in
fulfilling
the
motivational
function
of
conscience
.



As
the
characterization
of
conscience
as
self-assessment
here
presented
suggests
,
conscience
has
most
often
been
associated
with
negative
feelings
(Arendt
1971)
,
such
as
shame
,
guilt
,
fear
,
contrition
.


For
most
of
us
,
even
in
our
common
language
,
conscience
is
something
that
yields
negative
feelings
more
often
than
not—for
example
we
often
talk
of
the
“bites
of
conscience”
or
of
conscience
as
causing
us
“remorse”
(which
derives
from
the
Latin
“remordere”
,
i
.

e
.


,
“to
bite
again”)
.


However
,
a
joyful
conscience
that
praises
and
takes
pride
of
one’s
own
moral
merit
can
be
conceived
as
well
.


Examples
of
joyful
conscience
can
be
found
for
instance
in
Cicero
and
some
Latin
Stoics
,
most
prominently
Seneca
(Sorabji
2014
:
25–30)
.


Also
in
the
Protestant
tradition
started
by
Luther
we
find
the
idea
of
a
joyful
conscience
,
where
joy
springs
not
from
pride
or
self-praise
,
but
from
awareness
of
God’s
future
remission
of
sins
(Luther
1535
;
Calvin
1536)
.



The
contrast
between
the
Protestant
joyful
conscience
and
the
Catholic
conscience
burdened
by
negative
feelings
of
guilt
and
fear
was
emphasized
by
Luther
when
he
denounced
the
“terrorization
of
conscience”
by
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
.


According
to
Luther
,
with
this
terrorization
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
aimed
to
reinforce
its
authority
and
control
over
people’
conscience
.


In
fact
,
conscience
in
the
Catholic
tradition
can
only
be
relieved
from
its
burden
of
negative
feelings
through
the
confession
of
one’s
sins
to
a
priest
and
the
penitence
decided
by
that
priest
.

The
epistemic
function
of
conscience

Along
with
the
previous
,
non-epistemic
conception
of
conscience
,
we
can
also
understand
conscience
as
having
an
epistemic
function
.


In
this
sense
,
conscience
brings
us
some
form
of
moral
knowledge
or
moral
beliefs—either
in
an
absolute
sense
,
e
.

g
.


,
knowledge
of
divine
laws
,
or
in
a
relative
sense
,
e
.

g
.


,
knowledge
of
social
norms
in
one’s
culture
.



The
epistemic
role
of
conscience
does
not
necessarily
coincide
with
the
role
of
epistemic
faculties
or
functions
such
as
reason
,
intuitions
,
or
senses
.


In
particular
,
that
conscience
“brings”
us
moral
knowledge
or
beliefs
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
it
gives
us
direct
access
to
the
source
of
this
knowledge
or
of
these
beliefs
,
as
might
be
the
case
with
reason
,
intuitions
,
or
senses
.



The
knowledge
we
get
from
conscience
,
understood
as
possessing
an
epistemic
function
,
is
often
conceived
as
mediated
knowledge
.


This
is
not
surprising
,
since
,
as
we
have
seen
,
conscience
is
mostly
understood
as
inward
looking
,
which
presupposes
that
the
knowledge
to
which
it
gives
us
access
is
already
within
us
and
that
we
acquired
it
through
some
other
process
not
involving
conscience
.


In
fact
,
on
many
accounts
,
conscience
does
not
generate
its
own
moral
principles
.


For
example
,
the
moral
contents
we
discover
within
us
can
be
acquired
through
divine
intervention
,
as
is
the
case
with
the
laws
of
nature
which
,
according
to
Christians
,
God
infuses
in
our
heart
.


As
we
are
going
to
see
in
subsection
3
.

1
,
the
understanding
of
conscience
as
having
an
epistemic
function
and
as
the
recipient
of
mediated
knowledge
is
not
exclusive
to
religious
views
.



On
other
accounts
of
conscience
,
however
,
conscience
does
give
us
direct
access
to
moral
knowledge
,
for
example
as
an
intuition
about
what
is
good
and
what
is
bad
.



Let
us
examine
the
two
accounts
of
the
epistemic
role
of
conscience
in
more
detail
.



3

1
Conscience
as
a
faculty
for
indirect
moral
knowledge

In
the
Christian
tradition
,
starting
from
Paul
,
the
inward
looking
character
of
conscience
is
emphasized
by
the
metaphor
of
the
witness
(Romans
2
:
14–15)
.


Conscience
does
not
allow
us
to
acquire
the
knowledge
of
the
moral
law
directly
from
an
external
source
(God
in
this
case)
,
but
only
to
witness
the
presence
of
God’s
laws
within
us
.


Conscience
cannot
directly
contemplate
God
.


The
idea
of
a
faculty
that
gives
us
indirect
,
and
therefore
imperfect
knowledge
of
some
external
moral
authority
suits
religious
traditions
very
well
.


For
example
,
the
idea
that
through
conscience
we
discover
the
true
divine
laws
can
also
be
found
in
Islam
(Geaves
1999
:
164)
.



It
is
important
to
note
that
also
in
this
case
,
as
in
the
previous
understanding
of
conscience
as
self-awareness
and
self-assessment
,
conscience
can
be
conceived
as
fulfilling
an
introspective
function
,
i
.

e
.


,
as
being
directed
towards
the
self
and
towards
one’s
own
mental
states
.


Introspection
allows
one
to
gain
self-knowledge
(Schwitzgebel
---------------
before
his
papacy
,
Joseph
Ratzinger
said
that
“something
like
an
original
memory
of
the
good
and
the
true
(the
two
are
identical)
has
been
implanted
in
us”
,
and
conscience
is


so
to
speak
an
inner
sense
,
a
capacity
to
recall
,
so
that
the
one
whom
---------------

The
Catholic
Church
also
makes
reference
to
“the
voice
of
the
Lord
echoing
in
the
conscience
of
every
individual”
(John
Paul
II
1995
:
par
.


24)
.



On
this
account—since
conscience
is
only
a
witness
and
does
not
have
direct
epistemic
access
to
the
source
of
knowledge
,
i
.

e
.


,
to
God—conscience
is
considered
fallible
and
actually
often
erroneous
(1
Corinthians
4
:4
;
Aquinas
1265–1274
;
Butler
1726
:
sermon
3
(3))
.


In
particular
,
conscience
might
fail
to
correctly
interpret
the
divine
laws
when
applying
them
to
real
cases
.


According
to
some
13^(th)
Century
Catholic
theologians
,
such
as
Philip
the
Chancellor
,
Albert
the
Great
and
,
most
notably
,
Thomas
Aquinas
,
conscience
is
the
act
of
applying
universal
principles
(i
.

e
.


,
divine
laws)
to
real
situations
,
i
.

e
.


,
it
is
the
conclusion
of
the
practical
syllogism
whose
first
premise
is
a
universal
principle
provided
by
a
separate
faculty
called
“synderesis”
(Aquinas
,
Summa
Theologiae
,
1
q79
;
Langston
2000
and
2015
;
Sorabji
2014
:
62–66)
:
as
such
,
conscience
can
be
erroneous
in
deriving
moral
conclusions
from
first
principles
(Aquinas
,
On
Truth
,
q17
,
art
.


2
,
and
discussion
in
D’Arcy
1961
:
100–103)
.


However
,
other
Catholic
thinkers
have
emphasized
the
essential
role
of
conscience
in
humans
search
for
the
truth
.


Cardinal
John
Henry
Newman
,
for
instance
,
saw
conscience
as
the
moral
sense
that
can
lead
us
to
the
moral
truth
.


As
such
,
conscience
is
in
his
view
both
epistemic
and
action
guiding
,
but
the
two
aspects
are
not
distinguishable
,
to
the
extent
that
the
moral
truth
is
what
guides
our
actions
.


As
he
wrote
,
“The
feeling
of
conscience
…
is
twofold
:
it
is
a
moral
sense
,
and
a
sense
of
duty
;
a
judgment
of
the
reason
and
a
magisterial
dictate
.


Of
course
its
act
is
indivisible
;
---------------
instills
moral
principles
in
us
is
not
God
,
but
one’s
own
culture
or
upbringing
.


In
this
case
,
the
moral
knowledge
in
question
is
typically
understood
in
a
relativistic
sense
:
our
conscience
is
the
faculty
through
which
the
social
norms
of
our
culture
or
the
norms
of
our
upbringing
are
evoked
and
exert
their
influence
on
our
moral
psychology
.


These
norms
explain
our
moral
feelings
and
our
moral
choices
,
but
what
conscience
tells
us
in
this
case
is
the
product
of
social
and
cultural
dynamics
over
which
we
have
little
control
.


As
the
case
of
Huckleberry
Finn’s
conscience
demonstrates
,
hardly
can
conscience
so
understood
be
credited
any
moral
authority
,
since
our
educators
or
our
culture
might
be
highly
immoral
(for
example
our
conscience
might
end
up
drawing
on
racist
or
discriminatory
principles
,
such
as
the
ones
which
supported
slavery
in
Huck’s
social
environment)
.


And
in
fact
,
unsurprisingly
,
many
are
rather
skeptical
or
dismissive
of
the
moral
authority
of
conscience
,
since
they
see
it
as
mere
opinion
about
moral
principles
influenced
or
even
determined
by
one’s
own
culture
(Montaigne
1580
:
book
1
,
ch
.


22
;
Hobbes
1651
:

.


In
this
sense
,
conscience
is
a
merely
relativistic
notion
whose
content
changes
according
to
social
,
cultural
,
and
familial
circumstances
.

Conscience
as
a
faculty
for
direct
moral
knowledge

Contrary
to
what
Montaigne
and
Hobbes
had
claimed
,
Rousseau
argued
in
Emile
,
or
Education
that
good
education
can
free
conscience
from
the
corrupting
influences
of
societies
.


Actually
,
one
of
the
aims
of
education
is
to
render
the
young
autonomous
moral
thinkers
and
agents
by
teaching
them
how
to
critically
examine
and
,
if
necessary
,
replace
received
norms
(Rousseau
1762
;
see
Sorabji
2014
,
for
a
discussion)
.


The
idea
here
is
that
conscience
is
what
remains
of
our
innate
moral
sense
once
we
free
it
from
“childish
errors”
and
“prejudices
of
our
upbringing”
(Rousseau
1921
[1762]
:
253)
.


As
Rousseau
presents
it
,
---------------

justice
and
virtue
,
by
which
,
in
spite
of
our
maxims
,
we
judge
our
own

actions
or
those
of
others
to
be
good
or
evil
;
and
it
is
this

principle
that
I
call
conscience
.


(Rousseau
1921
[1762]
:
253)

According
to
Rousseau
,
then
,
conscience
has
a
natural
tendency
to
perceive
and
follow
the
right
order
of
nature
,
and
a
good
teacher
should
help
the
young’s
conscience
to
do
what
it
is
naturally
predisposed
to
do
.


In
Rousseau’s
words
:


Too
often
does
reason
deceive
us
;
we
have
only
too
good
a
right
to

doubt
her
;
but
conscience
never
deceives
us
;
she
is
the
true
guide
of

man
;
it
is
to
the
soul
what
instinct
is
to
the
body
;
he
who
obeys
his

conscience
is
following
nature
and
he
need
not
fear
that
he
will
go

astray…
Let
us
obey
the
call
of
nature
;
we
shall
see
that
her
yoke
is

easy
and
that
when
we
give
heed
to
her
voice
we
find
a
joy
in
the

answer
of
a
good
conscience
.


(Rousseau
1921
[1762]
:
252)

This
understanding
of
conscience
as
a
deeper
form
of
moral
knowledge
brings
us
to
the
second
sense
in
which
conscience
can
be
said
to
have
an
epistemic
role
.


As
well
as
merely
witnessing
received
opinions
or
divine
laws
,
conscience
can
also
be
conceived
as
a
moral
sense
giving
us
direct
access
to
moral
principles
.


Understood
in
this
way
,
conscience
is
typically
seen
as
intuitive
and
influenced
by
emotions
,
rather
than
a
reason-based
faculty
.


In
particular
,
18^(th)
Century
sentimentalist
philosophers
often
(e
.

g
.


,
Shaftesbury
(1711)
and
Hume
(1738–1740))
identified
conscience
with
a
moral
“sentiment”
or
moral
“sense”
.


According
to
Hume’s
psychological
theory
,
for
instance
,
“reason
is
wholly
inactive
and
can
never
be
the
source
of
so
active
a
principle
as
conscience
,
or
a
sense
of
morals”
(Hume
1738–1740
:
book
3
,
part
1
,
section
1)
.


Also
on
more
recent
accounts
of
conscience
and
of
private
morality
,
the
dictates
of
conscience
can
be
understood
as
expressions
of
our
moral
intuitions
.


According
to
Thagard
and
Finn
(2011)
,
for
instance
,
“conscience
is
a
kind
of
moral
intuition”
(p
.


168)
that
is
“both
cognitive
and
emotional”(p
.

156)
.



Once
again
,
there
are
reasons
to
doubt
the
epistemic
and
moral
authority
of
conscience
so
understood
.


A
lot
of
work
in
recent
moral
psychology
aimed
at
understanding
moral
disagreement
has
suggested
that
there
are
seemingly
irreconcilable
differences
in
fundamental
moral
intuitions
and
emotions
among
people
with
different
worldviews
(e
.

g
.


,
Haidt
2012
;
Greene
2013)
.


These
differences
in
fundamental
moral
intuitions
seem
to
undermine
the
epistemic
status
of
conscience
and
,
with
it
,
conscience’s
moral
authority
,
not
least
because
most
of
our
moral
intuitions
seem
,
according
to
these
recent
developments
in
moral
psychology
,
not
to
be
amenable
to
revision
in
light
of
new
evidence
or
new
good
reasons
.


Reasoning
,
on
any
plausible
account
,
should
be
an
important
part
of
morality
;
however
,
what
our
conscience
tells
us
may
have
little
to
do
with
reasons
and
evidence
.


Theoretical
work
in
moral
psychology
(e
.

g
.


,
Haidt
2012
;
Graham
et
al
.


2009
;
Haidt

,
supported
by
evidence
from
---------------
liberal
views
are
often
driven
by
other
specific
emotions

,
anger

and
intuitions

e
.

g
.


,
intuitive
rejection
of
fairness
violations
or
liberty
infringements
(Haidt
2001
and
2012)
.


If
conscience
simply
is
the
expression
of
moral
intuition
,
and
if
individuals
have
significantly
different
and
irreconcilable
moral
intuitions
,
then
individuals
also
have
significantly
different
and
difficult-to-reconcile
conscientious
moral
consciences
.

Conscience
as
motivation
to
act
morally

Conscience
can
also
be
conceived
as
our
sense
of
duty
.


According
to
this
understanding
,
conscience
motivates
us
to
act
according
to
moral
principles
or
beliefs
we
already
possess
(e
.

g
.


,
D’Arcy
1963
;
Childress
1979
;
McGuire
1963
;
Fuss
1964)
.


Conscience
so
understood
“establishes
a
general
sense
of
moral
obligation
in
the
individual’s
consciousness”
(Fuss
1964
:
116)
.


The
subjective
character
of
conscience
implies
that
the
motivational
force
must
come
entirely
from
within
the
individual
,
as
opposed
to
sanctions
from
an
external
authority
.



A
powerful
motivational
source
is
represented
by
the
feelings
that
conscience
generates
in
its
self-assessment
function
.


As
we
said
at
the
beginning
,
the
different
understandings
of
conscience
presented
here
are
not
necessarily
mutually
exclusive
.


Conscience
as
self-assessment
and
conscience
as
motivation
to
act
morally
constitute
a
good
example
of
perspectives
on
conscience
which
are
not
only
consistent
with
one
another
,
but
which
actually
complete
one
another
.


In
Kant
,
for
example
,
the
theory
of
conscience
can
be
seen
as
“a
motivation
theory
set
in
the
context
of
a
reflection
theory”
(Wood
2008
:
183)
:
As
Wood
interprets
the
Kantian
notion
of
conscience
,
“conscience
is
a
feeling
of
pleasure
or
displeasure
associated
with
myself”
that
arises
when
I
comply
or
don’t
comply
with
moral
principles
and
that
motivates
me
to
act
in
one
sense
rather
than
the
other
when
the
feeling
accompanies
the
contemplation
of
a
certain
course
of
action
(Wood
2008
:
183–184)
.


Conscience
for
Kant
is
therefore
not
only
an
inner
court
,
but
also
a
source
of
motivation
to
act
morally
,
that
is
,
motivation
to
follow
our
sense
of
duty
as
determined
by
reason
(Kant
1797
[1991
:
161])
.



More
generally
,
as
we
have
seen
in
section
1
,
conscience’s
self-assessment
often
produces
remorse
or
other
negative
feelings
(guilt
,
shame
,
fear
,
and
so
on)
.


Our
desire
or
tendency
to
avoid
this
form
of
self-punishment
can
have
motivational
force
towards
acting
morally
.


Thus
,
for
instance
,
according
to
Childress
the
motive
for
acting
morally
that
defines
conscience
is
“in
part
,
avoidance
of
a
sanction
imposed
by
the
self
on
itself”
(Childress
1979
:
328)
.



Consistent
with
this
philosophical
view
are
studies
in
developmental
psychology
suggesting
that
the
emotion
of
guilt
,
which
is
typically
seen
as
one
of
the
products
of
conscience
as
self-assessment
,
is
“the
motivational
engine
that
infuses
misdeeds
with
negative
personal
valence”
(Kochanska
and
Aksan
2006
:
1589)
.


Transgression
generates
---------------
self-directed
feelings
presuppose
one
another
,
this
need
not
be
the
case
.


It
is
possible
to
conceive
of
an
external
or
independent
source
of
that
most
fundamental
sense
of
duty
that
constitutes
our
conscience
,
such
as
for
example
our
moral
education
and
upbringing
(Mill
1861
:
ch
.


3)
.


But
the
sense
of
duty
that
identifies
a
conscientious
person
can
also
be
conceived
as
a
primitive
function
,
an
innate
disposition
which
is
not
explained
by
any
other
more
fundamental
mechanism
.


In
Kant
,
for
instance
,
“every
human
being
,
as
a
moral
being
,
has
a
conscience
within
him
originally”
(Kant
1797
[1991
:
160])
,
and
conscience
is
one
of
the
four
“natural
predispositions
of
the
mind
(…)
for
being
affected
by
concepts
of
duty”
,
the
other
three
being
moral
feeling
,
love
for
one’s
---------------
Negative
feelings
and
sense
of
duty
are
not
always
successful
in
prompting
agents
to
do
what
their
moral
principles
require
.


But
the
“bites
of
conscience”
,
or
just
the
prospect
of
bites
of
conscience
,
act
as
motivational
force
towards
aligning
our
future
behavior
to
those
norms
.


Of
course
,
positive
feelings
associated
with
conscience
might
also
have
a
motivational
force
.


For
example
,
as
seen
above
,
Kant
associated
conscience
also
with
positive
feelings
about
oneself
when
the
agent
recognizes
he
has
acted
according
to
his
sense
of
duty
.


Rousseau
,
alongside
the
epistemic
account
of
conscience
presented
above
,
also
provides
in
Emile
a
motivational
account
of
conscience
based
on
positive
feelings
:
while
reason
gives
us
knowledge
of
the
good
,
it
is
conscience
,
through
a
sentiment
of
love
for
the
good
,
which
motivates
us
to
behave
morally
(Rousseau
1762)
.

Conscience
,
self-identifying
moral
commitments
,
and
moral
integrity

The
subjective
character
of
conscience
delimits
a
sphere
of
personal
morality
that
is
an
essential
part
of
our
sense
of
personal
identity
,
understood
as
our
sense
of
who
we
are
and
of
what
characterizes
qualitatively
our
individuality
(for
instance
,
our
character
,
our
psychological
traits
,
our
past
experience
,
etc
.

)
.


My
conscience
is
what
makes
me
this
particular
individual
in
a
social
and
cultural
context
that
I
want
to
keep
separate
from
me
.



This
private
space
in
which
the
individual
finds
her
own
sense
of
identity
often
grounds
the
political
use
of
the
notion
of
conscience
.


Thus
,
many
people
claim
the
right
to
stick
to
their
conscience—particularly
by
advancing
so
called
“conscientious
objection”—when
social
expectations
or
legal
obligations
would
demand
otherwise
.


These
political
appeals
to
conscience
are
usually
made
on
the
basis
of
two
principles
.


The
first
is
the
principle
of
respect
for
moral
integrity
,
which
finds
its
justification
in
the
close
relationship
between
the
notions
of
conscience
and
of
moral
integrity
on
one
side
(Childress
1979)
,
and
the
sense
of
personal
identity
on
the
other
.


The
second
principle
often
invoked
in
the
political
uses
of
“conscience”
is
the
principle
of
“freedom
of
conscience”
.


The
former
will
be
discussed
in
this
section
,
and
the
latter
in
the
next
section
.



The
concept
of
personal
identity
in
the
sense
in
which
the
notion
is
used
here—i
.

e
what
defines
me
as
this
particular
person
in
a
qualitative
sense—is
intimately
related
to
the
notions
of
conscience
(Wicclair
2011
;
Childress
1979)
and
of
moral
integrity
,
and
more
specifically
to
the
“identity
view
of
integrity”
(Cox
et
al
.


2013
;
Williams
1973
and
1981)
.


---------------
their
life
is
fundamentally
about”
(Cox
et
al
.


2013)
.


This
identity-conferring
aspect
of
one’s
morality
is
exactly
what
some
people
call
“conscience”
.


According
to
Childress
,
for
example
,


[i]n
appealing
to
conscience
I
indicate
that
I
am
trying
to
preserve
a

sense
of
myself
,
my
wholeness
and
integrity
,
my
good
conscience
,
and

that
I
cannot
preserve
these
qualities
if
I
submit
to
certain

requirements
of
the
state
or
society
.


(Childress
1979
:
327)

Conscience
as
self-identifying
can
be
understood
in
two
ways
.


It
can
be
thought
of
either
as
a
set
of
core
and
self-identifying
moral
beliefs
that
are
“integral
to
an
agent’s
understanding
of
who
she
is
(i
.

e
.


,
her
---------------
viewed
in
relation
to
one’s
self
and
character”
(Bluestein
1993
:
294)
.



Conceived
in
either
way
,
conscience
is
an
essential
part
of
our
understanding
of
what
kind
of
person
we
are
,
and
this
is
taken
to
be
a
reason
for
warranting
protection
of
conscience
and
conscientious
objection
in
different
contexts
,
particularly
in
the
health
care
professions
(Wicclair
2011
:
25–26
;
Bluestein
1993
:
295)
.



We
have
seen
above
that
there
is
a
sense
in
which
,
according
to
some
,
psychopaths
can
be
said
to
lack
conscience
(Hare
1999)
:
psychopaths
are
not
capable
of
connecting
their
moral
knowledge
to
their
conduct
through
the
feelings
of
guilt
and
disapproval
which
conscience
,
on
some
accounts
,
produces
.


Interestingly
,
according
to
some
psychologists
,
psychopaths
are
also
less
likely
to
base
their
sense
of
personal
---------------
leads
us
to
say
that
a
certain
individual
is
not
the
same
person
anymore
(Strohminger
and
Nichols
2015)
.


These
findings
provide
empirical
support
to
the
idea
that
conscience
is
essential
to
one’s
sense
of
personal
identity
and
to
attributions
of
personal
identity

Freedom
of
conscience

Some
people
have
suggested
that
appeals
to
freedom
of
conscience
tend
to
be
more
vigorously
put
forward
and
more
effective
in
contexts
where
political
or
religious
structures
lose
power
or
moral
authority
.


Thus
,
for
instance
,
according
to
C
.

A
.


Pierce
:


conscience
only
came
into
its
own
in
the
Greek
world
after
the

collapse
of
the
city-state
.


The
close
integration
of
politics
with

ethics
,
with
the
former
predominant
,
was
no
longer
possible
:
there
was

no
sufficiently
close
authority
,
external
to
the
individual
,

effectively
to
direct
conduct
.


Consequently
,
as
a
pis
aller
,
men
fell

back
on
the
internal
chastisement
of
the
conscience
as
the
only

authority
.


(Pierce
1955
:
76)

The
same
can
be
said
for
17^(th)
Century
England
,
with
its
crisis
of
religious
authority
and
the
frequent
appeals
to
freedom
of
conscience
in
the
philosophical
and
political
literature
of
that
time
(Childress
1979
:
326)
.



There
are
three
main
arguments
that
can
be
used
to
defend
a
principle
of
freedom
of
conscience
.


Two
of
them
are
frequently
found
in
the
16^(th)
and
17^(th)
Century
philosophical
literature
:
they
are
the
“argument
from
ineffectiveness
or
hypocrisy”
and
the
“argument
from
ignorance”
---------------
a)
The
argument
from
ineffectiveness
or
hypocrisy
is
based
on
the
relevance
of
the
distinction
between
beliefs
and
acts
for
the
definition
of
conscience
.


According
to
this
argument
,
it
is
not
possible
to
compel
someone
to
believe
or
to
not
believe
something
,
i
.

e
.


,
to
change
one’s
conscientious
beliefs
.


All
we
can
do
is
compel
people
to
act
as
if
they
---------------
if
some
authority
aims
to
convert
people
or
to
change
people’s
moral
views
,
prohibiting
the
free
expression
,
through
actions
,
of
one’s
conscience
would
not
serve
this
purpose
.



This
line
of
argument
was
often
put
forward
by
early
Christians
,
most
---------------
practice
their
cult
in
a
time
where
they
were
persecuted
by
Roman
governors
:
their
claim
was
that
forcing
them
to
abandon
the
Christian
cults
would
have
no
effect
on
their
conscience
.


The
same
line
of
argument
can
also
be
found
in
Locke’s
works
on
toleration
,
the
Essay
Concerning
Toleration
of
1667
and
A
Letter
Concerning
Toleration
of
---------------

However
,
Christians
did
not
seem
to
believe
in
the
force
of
this
argument
,
and
more
generally
in
the
principle
of
freedom
of
conscience
,
when
,
later
on
,
they
attempted
to
justify
the
violent
persecution
of
heretics
(those
who
revise
their
religious
dogmas)
and
apostates
(those
---------------
to
follow
the
true
religion—by
which
he
meant
persecuting
heretics—could
open
their
eyes
to
the
truth
(Sorabji
2014
:
49–50)
.


This
thesis
implies
that
sometimes
conscience
,
even
if
we
confine
it
to
matters
of
inward
conviction
and
not
to
behavior
,
can
be
influenced
by
some
external
imposition
.



This
latter
approach
based
on
the
idea
of
bringing
the
truth
to
conscience
by
“freeing”
conscience
from
error
is
consistent
with
the
Catholic
peculiar
understanding
of
the
notion
of
freedom
of
conscience
.


Philosophically
speaking
,
“freedom
of
conscience”
is
typically
understood
as
an
individualistic
concept
that
allows
for
a
plurality
of
moral
and
religious
views
(Strohm
2011
:
90)
.


For
the
Catholic
Church
,
---------------
Newman
,
Joseph
Ratzinger
writes
that
in
the
Catholic
view
“truth”
is
the
middle
term
that
reconciles
authority
of
God
and
subjectivity
of
conscience
:
the
latter
,
when
authentically
free
,
cannot
but
reveal
the
truth
established
by
the
former
(Ratzinger
1991
[2010])
.


Since
,
as
we
have
seen
above
,
in
the
Catholic
view
reason
alone
can’t
create
its
own
---------------
of
that
law”
of
God
(John
Paul
II
1993
:
par
.


35)
.


So
when
practical
reason
is
free
to
exercise
its
“participation”
(John
Paul
II
1993
:
sec
.


40)
in
the
divine
law
,
then
“in
the
depths
of
his
conscience
,
man
detects
a
law
which
he
does
not
impose
upon
himself
,
but
which
holds
him
to
obedience”
(Paul
VI
1965
:
par
.


16)
.


---------------
In
any
case
,
it
is
not
necessary
to
dismiss
the
argument
from
ineffectiveness
in
order
to
justify
imposing
norms
and
practices
that
might
violate
individuals’
conscience
.


Actually
,
the
same
argument
from
ineffectiveness
can
be
used
to
support
the
imposition
of
policies
that
might
conflict
with
individuals’
consciences
.


On
the
basis
of
the
idea
that
conscience
is
merely
a
matter
of
private
beliefs
,
not
of
action
,
some
authors
have
argued
that
compelling
people
to
follow
certain
rules
even
against
their
conscience
would
not
constitute
a
violation
of
their
freedom
of
conscience
,
and
is
therefore
justifiable
.


This
was
the
line
of
argument
pursued
,
for
example
,
by
Thomas
Hobbes
(1651
:
chapter
40)
,
Baruch
Spinoza
(1670
:
chapter
20)
and
John
Locke
(1660)
,
who
argued
that
the
State
has
the
power
to
enforce
certain
practices
even
when
citizens
claim
that
it
would
violate
their
conscience
,
in
order
to
protect
social
order
.



b)
The
“argument
from
ignorance”
,
which
might
be
better
labeled
“argument
from
humility”
,
is
based
on
a
skeptical
approach
to
the
content
of
conscience
.


The
possibility
exists
that
what
we
conscientiously
believe
is
wrong
and
that
those
holding
conscientious
beliefs
opposite
to
ours
are
right
.


Therefore
,
there
is
a
reason
for
not
---------------
a
significant
proportion
of
its
religious
and
moral
authority
following
the
Protestant
reform
in
16^(th)
and
17^(th)
Century—which
was
defined
by
Keith
Thomas
(1993)
as
“the
age
of
conscience”
.


It
was
at
that
time
that
we
assisted
to
the
“secularization
of
conscience”
in
the
modern
era
(Strohm
2011)
,
although
the
phenomenon
would
be
better
conceived
of
as
a
“re-secularization”
,
since
conscience
was
not
related
to
the
voice
or
the
authority
of
God
in
the
Greek
world
.



---------------
John
Locke
in
his
Second
Letter
Concerning
Toleration
.


Locke
had
to
rely
on
this
argument
as
an
alternative
strategy
to
defend
freedom
of
conscience
after
the
Anglican
priest
Jonas
Proast
pointed
out
that
compulsion
can
actually
change
personal
beliefs
(as
Augustine
had
argued)
,
and
that
therefore
the
argument
from
ineffectiveness
that
Locke
---------------
conscientious
objection
in
health
care
.



c)
Finally
,
the
third
argument
in
defense
of
freedom
of
conscience
is
what
I
have
called
above
the
“argument
from
legitimization”
.


John
Stuart
Mill
(1859)
defended
freedom
of
conscience
by
appealing
to
the
idea
that
allowing
the
free
expression
of
any
opinion
,
and
particularly
mistaken
opinions
,
would
allow
truth
to
emerge
more
clearly
and
would
provide
us
---------------

any
rational
assurance
of
being
right
.

1859
:

Freedom
of
conscience
and
conscientious
objection
today

Freedom
of
conscience
is
today
protected
by
the
United
Nations
Universal
Declaration
of
Human
Rights
,
which
reads
:
“Everyone
has
the
right
to
freedom
of
thought
,
conscience
and
religion”
(art
.


18)
.



According
to
Strohm
,
this
article
should
not
be
taken
to
imply
freedom
to
act
according
to
one’s
conscience
,
but
it
only
refers
to
“matters
of
inward
conviction”
(Strohm
2011
:
88)
.


If
this
interpretation
is
correct
,
article
18
does
not
seem
to
raise
any
interesting
philosophical
or
---------------
matters
of
inward
conviction
.


More
problematic
is
the
moral
and
political
debate
about
the
freedom
to
act
,
or
to
refrain
from
acting
,
according
to
one’s
conscience
,
especially
where
there
are
professional
roles
or
legal
obligations
that
would
demand
otherwise
.


In
fact
,
appeals
to
conscience
and
freedom
of
conscience
are
often
deployed
to
claim
and
justify
“conscientious
objection”
to
certain
activities
that
someone
would
otherwise
be
required
to
perform
.


---------------

As
most
States
have
now
abolished
conscription
,
appeals
to
freedom
of
conscience
and
to
conscientious
objection
today
can
be
found
mainly
in
debates
in
medical
ethics
with
regard
to
health
practitioners
who
conscientiously
object
to
performing
medical
procedures
they
morally
---------------

According
to
those
who
are
against
a
right
to
conscientious
objection
,
professional
obligations
trump
any
value
conscience
might
have
and
any
principle
that
might
justify
conscientious
objection
qua
conscientious

according
to
defenders
of

,
professionals’
conscience
must
be
protected

the
largest
extent
possible
,

up

the
point
where

or

health
of
patients

it
is

validity

the
soundness
of

is

objection
,
it
seems
that
the
value
of
conscience
and
the
principle
of
freedom
of
conscience
are
no
longer
at
stake
.


What
makes
an
objection
good
or
bad
,
acceptable
or
unacceptable
,
has
nothing
to
do
with
its
being
conscientious
,
unless

Conclusion

There
is
no
such
a
thing
as
the
notion
of
conscience
,
both
in
a
philosophical
and
in
a
psychological
sense
.


As
we
have
seen
,
the
concept
of
conscience
has
been
given
different
interpretations
throughout
history
,
sometimes
on
the
basis
of
underlying
systematic
philosophical
theories
of
the
mind
and
of
morality
,
and
sometimes
serving
religious
or
---------------
This
lack
of
uniformity
is
not
only
a
problem
for
historians
and
theoretical
philosophers
.


Because
it
cannot
be
immediately
clear
what
we
are
talking
about
when
we
talk
of
conscience
,
of
freedom
of
conscience
,
or
of
conscientious
objection
,
it
is
important
that
clarity
is
made
every
time
conscience
is
appealed
to
in
different
branches
of
applied
philosophy
(particularly
medical
ethics)
and
in
public
debates
alike
.



This
entry
has
presented
a
conceptual
map
,
rather
than
a
historical
account
,
of
conscience
,
which
can
provide
some
guidance
for
those
engaged
in
this
clarificatory
task
.


One
of
the
benefits
of
clarifying
concepts
,
and
clarifying
them
in
the
different
circumstances
in
which
they
are
used
,
is
their
subsequent
demystification
.



Conscience
needs
to
be
demystified
,
since
it
is
one
of
those
concepts
that
tend
to
elicit
reverence
rather
than
questions
or
an
interest
in
further
inquiry
.


As
seen
above
,
appeals
to
conscience
often
replace
reason
giving
and
are
made
with
the
expectation
that
no
further
reason
for
one’s
decisions
and
positions
is
requested
.


This
attitude
is
also
displayed
in
many
legislative
approaches
dealing
with
the
notion
of
conscience
;
in
particular
,
legislations
about
conscientious
objection
in
health
care
typically
grant
doctors
a
right
to
object
to
performing
certain
professional
activities
(e
.

g
.


,
conscientious
objection
to
---------------
let
alone
submitting
reasons
to
some
form
of
assessment
.



This
entry
has
distinguished
four
main
understandings
of
conscience
,
drawing
on
the
philosophical
tradition
of
the
concept
.


Whether
the
concept
is
to
be
understood
as
a
faculty
for
self-knowledge
and
---------------
self-identifying
moral
beliefs
,
or
a
combination
of
any
of
these
characterizations
,
it
is
important
to
have
clear
in
mind
what
exactly
we
are
talking
about
when
we
talk
of
conscience
and
of
freedom
of
conscience
in
each
circumstance
.



Far
from
being
a
conversation-stopper
,
conscience
can
only
find
its
proper
place
in
philosophical
and
in
public
discussion
if
its
philosophical
and
psychological
aspects
are
teased
out
,
defined
and
assessed
.


Appeals
to
conscience
can
only
be
part
of
philosophical
,
political
,
and
legal
discussion
if
they
are
seen
as
the
start
,
not
the
end
of
discussions
.

A
conscience
is
a
cognitive
process
that
elicits
emotion
and
rational
associations
based
on
an
individual
'
s
moral
philosophy
or
value
system
.


Conscience
stands
in
contrast
to
elicited
emotion
or
thought
due
to
associations
based
on
immediate
sensory
perceptions
and
reflexive
responses
,
as
in
sympathetic
central
nervous
system
responses
.


In
common
terms
,
conscience
is
often
described
as
leading
to
feelings
of
remorse
when
a
person
commits
an
act
that
conflicts
with
their
moral
values
.


The
extent
to
which
conscience
informs
moral
judgment
before
an
action
and
whether
such
moral
judgments
are
or
should
be
based
on
reason
has
occasioned
debate
through
much
of
modern
history
between
theories
of
---------------
Ages
.



Religious
views
of
conscience
usually
see
it
as
linked
to
a
morality
inherent
in
all
humans
,
to
a
beneficent
universe
and/or
to
divinity
.


The
diverse
ritualistic

features

may
not
necessarily
cohere
with
experiential
,
emotive
,
spiritual
or
contemplative
considerations
about
the
origin
and
operation
of
conscience
.

^([1])
Common
secular
or
scientific
views
regard
the
capacity
for
conscience
as
probably
genetically
determined
,
with
its
subject
probably
learned
or
imprinted
as
part
of
a
culture
.

Commonly
used
metaphors
for
conscience
include

"voice

,

have
addressed

Seated
Buddha
,
Gandhara
,
2nd
century
CE

The
Buddha
linked
conscience
with

In
the
literary
traditions
of
the
Upanishads
,
Brahma
Sutras
and
the
Bhagavad
Gita
,
conscience
is
the
label
given
to
attributes
composing
knowledge
about
good
and
evil
,
that
a
soul
acquires
from
the
completion
of
acts
and
consequent
accretion
of
karma
over
many
lifetimes
.

^([9])
---------------
In
the
Zoroastrian
faith
,
after
death
a
soul
must
face
judgment
at
the
Bridge
of
the
Separator
;
there
,
evil
people
are
tormented
by
prior
denial
of
their
own
higher
nature
,
or
conscience
,
and
"to
all
time
will
they
be
guests
for
the
House
of
the

The
Chinese
concept
of

indicates
that

,

capacity

Conscience
also
features
prominently
in
Buddhism
.

^([14])
In
the
Pali
scriptures
,
for
example
,
Buddha
links
the
positive
aspect
of
conscience
to
a
pure
heart
and
a
calm
,
well-directed
mind
.


It
is
regarded
as
a
spiritual
power
,
and
one
of
the
"Guardians
of
the
World"
.


The
Buddha
also
associated
conscience
with
compassion
for
those
who
must
endure
cravings
and
suffering
in
the
world
until
right
conduct
culminates
in
right
mindfulness
and
right
contemplation

as

or

;
so
one
can
continue
advancing
towards
right
understanding
in

.

^([16])
Conscience
thus
manifests
in
Buddhism
as
unselfish
love
for
all
living
beings
which
gradually
intensifies
and
awakens
to
a
purer

The
Roman
Emperor

Aurelius
wrote
in
his
Meditations
that
conscience
was
the
human
capacity
to
live
by

that
were
congruent
with
the
true
,
tranquil
and

nature
of

mind

The
Islamic
concept
of
Taqwa
is
closely
related
to
conscience
.


In
the
Qur’ān
verses
2
:197
&
22
:37
Taqwa
refers
to
"right
conduct"
or
"piety"
,
"guarding
of
oneself"
or
"guarding
against
evil"
.

^([20])
Qur’ān
verse
---------------
is
not
simply
the
product
of
individual
will
but
requires
inspiration
from
God
.

^([21])
In
Qur’ān
verses
91
:7–8
,
God
the
Almighty
talks
about
how
He
has
perfected
the
soul
,
the
conscience
and
has
taught
it
the
wrong
(fujūr)
and
right
(taqwā)
.


Hence
,
the
awareness
of
vice
and
virtue
is
inherent
in
the
soul
,

it
to

The
Awakening
Conscience
,
Holman
Hunt
,
1853

In
the
Protestant
Christian
tradition
,
Martin
Luther
insisted
in
the
Diet
of
Worms
that
his
conscience
was
captive
to
the
Word
of
God
,
and
it
was
neither
safe
nor
right
to
go
against
conscience
.


To
Luther
,
conscience
falls
within
the
ethical
,
rather
than
the
religious
,
sphere
.

^([25])
John
Calvin
saw
conscience
as
a
battleground
:
"the
enemies
who
rise
up
in
our
conscience
against
his
Kingdom
and
hinder
his
decrees
prove
that
God
'
s
throne
is
not
firmly
established
therein"
.

^([26])
Many
Christians
regard
following
one
'
s
conscience
as
important
as
,
or
even
more
important
than
,
obeying
human
authority
.

^([27])
According
to
the
bible
,
written
in
Romans
2
:15
,
conscience
is
the
one
bearing
witness
,
accusing
or
excusing
one
another
,
so
we
would
know
when
we
break
the
law
written
in
our
hearts
;
the
guilt
we
feel
when
we
do
something
wrong
tells
us
that
we

And
they
which

,

[However
the
word

'
conscience

is
not
in
the
original
New
Testament
Greek
,
and
is
not
in
the
vast
majority
of
Bible
versions

(see
Jesus
and
the
woman

.


In
the
Gospel
of
Luke
(10
:
25–37)
Jesus
tells
the
story
of
how
a
despised
and
heretical
Samaritan
(see
Parable
of
the
Good
Samaritan)
who
(out
of
compassion/pity
-
the
word

'
conscience
'

is
not
used)
helps
an
injured
stranger

better
for

This
dilemma
of
obedience
in
conscience
to
divine
or
state
law
,
was
demonstrated
dramatically
in
Antigone
'
s
defiance
of
King
Creon
'
s
order
against
burying
her
brother
an
alleged
traitor
,
appealing
to
the

.

^([32])

Catholic
theology
sees
conscience
as
the
last
practical
"judgment
of
reason
which
at
the
appropriate
moment
enjoins
[a
person]
to
do
good
and
to
avoid
evil"
.

^([33])
The
Second
Vatican
Council
(1962–65)
describes
:
"Deep
within
his
conscience
man
discovers
a
law
which
he
has
not
laid
upon
himself
but
which
he
must
obey
.


Its
voice
,
ever
calling
him
to
love
and
to
do
what
is
good
and
to
avoid
evil
,
tells
him
inwardly
at
the
right
movement
:
do
this
,
shun
that
.


For
man
has
in
his
heart
a
law
inscribed
by
God
.


His
dignity
lies
in
observing
this
law
,
and
by
it
he
will
be
judged
.


His
conscience
is
man’s
most
secret
core
,
and
his
sanctuary
.


There
he
is
alone
with
God
whose
voice
echoes
in
his
depths
.

"^([34])
Thus
,
conscience
is
not
like
the
will
,
nor
a
habit
like
prudence
,
but
"the
interior
space
in
which
we
can
listen
to
and
hear
the
truth
,
the
good
,
the
voice
of
God
.


It
is
the
inner
place
of
our
---------------
to
understand
the
path
we
ought
to
take
,
and
once
the
decision
is
made
,
to
move
forward
,
to
remain
faithful"^([35])
In
terms
of
logic
,
conscience
can
be
viewed
as
the
practical
conclusion
of
a
moral
syllogism
whose
major
premise
is
an
objective
norm
and
whose
minor
premise
is
a
particular
case
or
situation
to
which
the
norm
is
applied
.


Thus
,
Catholics
are
taught
to
carefully
educate
themselves
as
to
revealed
norms
and
norms
derived
therefrom
,
so
as
to
form
a
correct
conscience
.


Catholics
are
also
to
examine
their
conscience
daily
and
with
special
care
before
confession
.


Catholic
teaching
holds
that
,
"Man
has
the
right
to
act
according
to
his
conscience
and
in
freedom
so
as
personally
to
make
moral
decisions
.


He
must
not
be
forced
to
act
contrary
to
his
conscience
.


Nor
must
he
be
prevented
from
acting
according
to
his
conscience
,
especially
in
religious
matters"
.

^([36])
This
right
of
conscience
does
not
allow
one
to
arbitrarily
disagree
with
Church
teaching
and
claim
that
one
is
acting
in
accordance
with
conscience
.


A
sincere
conscience
presumes
one
is
diligently
seeking
moral
truth
from
authentic
sources
,
that
is
,
seeking
to
conform
oneself
to
that
moral
truth
by
listening
to
the
authority
established
by
Christ
to
teach
it
.


Nevertheless
,
despite
one
'
s
best
effort
,
"[i]t
can
happen
that
moral
conscience
remains
in
ignorance
and
makes
erroneous
judgments
about
acts
to
be
performed
or
already
committed 
.


.


.


This
ignorance
can
often
be
imputed
to
personal
responsibility 
.


.


.


In
such
cases
,
the
person
is
culpable
for
the
wrong
he
commits
.

"^([37])
Thus
,
if
one
realizes
one
may
have
made
a
mistaken
judgment
,
one
'
s
conscience
is
said
to
be
vincibly
erroneous
and
it
is
not
a
valid
norm
for
action
.


One
must
first
remove
the
source
of
error
and
do
one
'
s
best
to
achieve
a
correct
judgment
.


If
,
however
,
one
is
not
aware
of
one
'
s
error
or
if
,
despite
an
honest
and
diligent
effort
one
cannot
remove
the
error
by
study
or
seeking
advice
,
then
one
'
s
conscience
may
be
said
to
be
invincibly
erroneous
.


It
binds
since
one
has
subjective
certainty
that
one
is
correct
.


The
act
resulting
from
acting
on
the
invincibly
erroneous
conscience
is
not
good
in
itself
,
yet
this
deformed
act
or
material
sin
against
God
'
s
right
order
and
the
objective
norm
is
not
imputed
to
the
person
.


The
formal
obedience
given
to
such
a
judgment
of
conscience
is
good
.


Some
Catholics
appeal
to
conscience
in
order
to
justify
dissent
,
not
on
the
level
of
conscience
properly
understood
,
but
on
the
level
of
the
principles
and
norms
which
are
supposed
to
inform
conscience
.


For
example
,
some
priests
make
on
the
use
of
the
so-called
internal
forum
solution
(which
is
not
sanctioned
by
the
Magisterium)
to
justify
actions

teaching

.


can
be
at
the
source
of
errors
in
judgment
in
moral
conduct"
.

An
example
of
someone
following
his
conscience
to
the
point
of
accepting
the
consequence
of
being
condemned
to
death
is
Sir
Thomas
More
(1478-1535)

wrote
on
the
distinction
between
the

'
sense
of
duty
'

and
the

'
moral
sense
'

,
as
two
aspects
of
conscience

and
who
saw
the
former
as
some
feeling
that
can
only
be
explained
by
a
divine
Lawgiver

was
John

well
known
saying
of
him
is
that
he
would
first

him
to

an
occupation

destiny
has
been
central
to

Jewish
faith

many
scholars
(including
Moses

stated
that

an
important
adjunct
to

tradition

Freemasonry
describes
itself
as

an
adjunct
to
religion
and
key
symbols
found
in
a
Freemason
Lodge
are

compasses
explained
as
providing
lessons
that
Masons
should
"square

square

,
learn
to
"circumscribe
their

and
keep
their

"^([45])
The
historian
Manning
Clark
viewed
conscience
as
one
of
the
comforters
that
religion
placed
between
man
and
death

also
a
crucial
part
of
the
quest

Illustration
of
François
Chifflart
(1825–1901)
for
La
Conscience
(by
Victor
Hugo)

---------------

Charles
Darwin
thought
that
any
animal
endowed
with
well-marked
social
instincts
would
inevitably
acquire
a
moral
sense
or
conscience
,
as
its
intellectual
powers
approximated
man
'
s
.



The
secular
approach
to
conscience
includes
psychological
,
physiological
,
sociological
,
humanitarian
,
and
authoritarian
views
.

^([53])
Lawrence
Kohlberg
considered
critical
conscience
to
be
an
important
psychological
stage
in
the
proper
moral
development
of
humans
,
associated
with
the
capacity
to
rationally
weigh
principles
of
---------------
humorous
personifications
(such
as
Jiminy
Cricket)
and
later
in
adolescents
by
debates
about
individually
pertinent
moral
dilemmas
.

^([54])
Erik
Erikson
placed
the
development
of
conscience
in
the

'
pre-schooler
'

phase
of
his
eight
stages
of
normal
human
personality
development
.

^([55])
The
psychologist
Martha
Stout
terms
conscience
"an
intervening
sense
of
obligation
based
in
our
emotional
attachments
.

"^([56])
Thus
a
good
conscience
is
associated
with
feelings
of
integrity
,
psychological
wholeness
and
peacefulness
and
is
often
described
using
adjectives
such
as
"quiet"
,
"clear"
and
"easy"
.

^([57])

Sigmund
Freud
regarded
conscience
as
originating
psychologically
from
the
growth
of
civilisation
,
which
periodically
frustrated
the
external
expression
of
aggression
:
this
destructive
impulse
being
forced
to
seek
---------------
against
the
person
'
s
own
"ego"
or
selfishness
(often
taking
its
cue
in
this
regard
from
parents
during
childhood)
.

^([58])
According
to
Freud
,
the
consequence
of
not
obeying
our
conscience
is
guilt
,
which
can
be
a
factor
in
the
development
of
neurosis
;
Freud
claimed
that
both
the
cultural
and
individual
super-ego
set
up
strict
ideal
demands
with
regard
to
the
moral
aspects
of
certain
decisions
,
disobedience
to
which
provokes
a

'
fear
of
conscience
'

.

^([59])

Antonio
Damasio
considers
conscience
an
aspect
of
extended
consciousness
beyond
survival-related
dispositions
and
incorporating
the
search
for
truth
and
desire
to
build
norms
and
ideals
for
behavior
.

Conscience
as
a
society-forming
instinct

[edit]
---------------

Jeremy
Bentham
:
"Fanaticism
never
sleeps 
.


.


.


it
is
never
stopped
by
conscience
;
for
it
has
pressed
conscience
into
its
service
.

"

Michel
Glautier
argues
that
conscience
is
one
of
the
instincts
and
drives
which
enable
people
to
form
societies
:
groups
of
humans
without
these
drives
or
in
whom
they
are
insufficient
cannot
form
societies
and
---------------

War
criminal
Adolf
Eichmann
in
passport
used
to
enter
Argentina
:
his
conscience
spoke
with
the
"respectable
voice"
of
the
indoctrinated
wartime
German
society
that
surrounded
him
.



Charles
Darwin
considered
that
conscience
evolved
in
humans
to
resolve
conflicts
between
competing
natural
impulses-some
about
self-preservation
but
others
about
safety
of
a
family
or
community
;
the
claim
of
conscience
to
moral
authority
emerged
from
the
"greater
duration
of
impression
of
social
instincts"
in
the
struggle
for
survival
.

^([62])
In
such
a
view
,
behavior
destructive
to
a
person
'
s
society
(either
to
its
structures
or
to
the
persons
it
comprises)
is
bad
or
"evil"
.

^([63])
Thus
,
conscience
can
be
viewed
as
an
outcome
of
those
biological
drives
that
prompt
humans
to
avoid
provoking
fear
or
contempt
in
others
;
being
experienced
as
guilt
and
shame
in
differing
ways
from
society
to
society
and
person
to
person
.

^([64])
A
requirement
of
conscience
in
this
view
is
the
capacity
to
see
ourselves
from
the
point
of
view
of
another
person
.

^([65])
Persons
unable
to
do
this
(psychopaths
,
sociopaths
,
narcissists)
therefore
often
act
in
ways
which
are
"evil"
.

^([66])

Fundamental
in
this
view
of
conscience
is
that
humans
consider
some
"other"
as
being
in
a
social
relationship
.


Thus
,
nationalism
is
invoked
in
conscience
to
quell
tribal
conflict
and
the
notion
of
a
Brotherhood
of
Man
is
invoked
to
quell
national
conflicts
.


Yet
such
crowd
drives
may
not
only
overwhelm
but
redefine
individual
conscience
.


Friedrich
Nietzsche
stated
:
"communal
solidarity
is
annihilated
by
the
highest
and
strongest
drives
that
,
when
they
break
out
passionately
,
whip
the
individual
far
past
the
average
low
level
of
the

'
herd-conscience
.


'
"^([67])
Jeremy
Bentham
noted
that
:
"fanaticism
never
sleeps 
.

.


it
is
never
stopped
by
conscience
;
for
it

"^([68])
Hannah
Arendt
in
her
study
of
the
trial
of
Adolf
Eichmann
in
Jerusalem
,
notes
that
the
accused
,
as
with
almost
all
his
fellow
Germans
,
had
lost
track
of
his
conscience
to
the
point
where
they
hardly
remembered
it
;
this
wasn

t
caused
by
familiarity
with
atrocities
or
by
psychologically
redirecting
any
resultant
natural
pity
to
themselves
for
having
to
bear
such
an
unpleasant
duty
,
so
much
as
by
the
fact
that
anyone
whose
conscience
did
develop
doubts
could
see
no
one
who
shared
them
:
"Eichmann
did
not
need
to
close
his
ears
to
the
voice
of
conscience 
.

.


not
because
he
had
none

but
because

respectable
society
around
him"
.

Neuroscience

to
locate
the

necessary
for
what
is
termed
the

'

of

over
unconscious
mental
processes
(see

Jacques

claims
that
some

Virtue
ethics
,
Metaethics
,
Moral
motivation
,
and
Normative
ethics

The
word
"conscience"
derives
etymologically
from
the
Latin
conscientia
,
meaning
"privity
of
knowledge"^([83])
or
"with-knowledge"
.


The
English
word
implies
internal
awareness
of
a
moral
standard
in
the
mind
concerning
the
quality
of
one
'
s
motives
,
as
well
as
a
consciousness
of
our
own
actions
.

^([84])
Thus
conscience
considered
philosophically
may
be
first
,
and
perhaps
most
commonly
,
a
largely
unexamined
"gut
feeling"
or
"vague
sense
of
guilt"
about
what
ought
to
be
or
should
have
been
done
.

^([85])
Conscience
in
this
sense
is
not
necessarily
the
product
of
a
process
of
rational
consideration
of
the
moral
features
of
a
situation
(or
the
applicable
normative
principles
,
rules
or
laws)
and
can
arise
from
parental
,
peer

religious
,
state
or
corporate
indoctrination
,
which
may
or
may
not
be
presently
consciously
acceptable
to
the
person
("traditional
conscience")
.

^([86])
Conscience
may
be
defined
as
the
practical
reason
employed
when
applying
moral
convictions
to
a
situation
("critical
conscience")
.

^([87])
In
purportedly
morally
mature
mystical
people
who
have
developed
this
capacity
through
daily
contemplation
or
meditation
combined
with
selfless
service
to
others
,
critical
conscience
can
be
aided
by
a
"spark"

insight

philosophy

synderesis

The

as

"an
outflowing
losing
of
oneself
in
the
abyss
of
that
eternal
object
which
is
the
highest
and
chief
blessedness"
.



Some
medieval
Christian
scholastics
such
as
Bonaventure
made
a
distinction
between
conscience
as
a
rational
faculty
of
the
mind
(practical
reason)
and
inner
awareness
,
an
intuitive
"spark"
to
do
good
,
called
synderesis
arising
from
a
remnant
appreciation
of
absolute
good
---------------
becoming
a
source
of
inner
torment
.

^([89])
Early
modern
theologians
such
as
William
Perkins
and
William
Ames
developed
a
syllogistic
understanding
of
the
conscience
,
where
God
'
s
law
made
the
first
term
,
the
act
to
be
judged
the
second
and
the
action
of
the
conscience
(as
a
rational
faculty)
produced
the
judgement
.


By
debating
test
cases
applying
such
understanding
conscience
was
trained
and
refined
(i

e

casuistry)
.

^([93])

---------------
The
medieval
Persian
philosopher
Ibn
Sina
(Avicenna)
developed
a
sensory
deprivation
thought
experiment
to
explore
the
relationship
between
conscience
and
God
.



In
the
13th
century
,
St
.


Thomas
Aquinas
regarded
conscience
as
the
application
of
moral
knowledge
to
a
particular
case
(S
.

T
.


I
,
q
.


79
,

.


Thus
,
conscience
was
considered
an
act
or
judgment
of
practical
reason
that
began
with
synderesis
,
the
structured
development
of
our
innate
remnant
awareness
of
absolute
good
(which
he
categorised
as
involving
the
five
primary
precepts
proposed
in
his
theory
of
Natural
Law)
into
an
acquired
habit
of
applying
moral
principles
.

^([50])
According
to
Singer
,
Aquinas
held
that
conscience
,
or
conscientia
was
an
imperfect
process
of
judgment
applied
to
activity
because
knowledge
of
the
natural
law
(and
all
acts
of
natural
virtue
implicit
therein)
was
obscured
in
most
people
by
education
and
custom
that
promoted
selfishness
rather
than
fellow-feeling
(Summa
Theologiae
,
I–II
,
I)
.

^([94])
Aquinas
also
discussed
conscience
in
relation
to
the
virtue
of
prudence
to
explain
why
some
people
appear
to
be
less
"morally
enlightened"
than
others
,
their
weak
will
being
incapable
of
adequately
balancing
their
own
needs
with
those
of
others
.

^([95])

Aquinas
reasoned
that
acting
contrary
to
conscience
is
an
evil
action
but
an
errant
conscience
is
only
blameworthy
if
it
is
the
result
of
culpable
or
vincible
ignorance
of
factors
that
one
has
a
duty
to
have
knowledge
of
.

^([94])
Aquinas
also
argued
that
conscience
should
be
educated
to
act
towards
real
goods
(from
God)
which
encouraged
human
flourishing
,
rather
than
the
apparent
goods
of
sensory
pleasures
.

^([94])
---------------
Thomas
A
Kempis
in
the
medieval
contemplative
classic
The
Imitation
of
Christ
(ca
1418)
stated
that
the
glory
of
a
good
man
is
the
witness
of
a
good
conscience
.


"Preserve
a
quiet
conscience
and
you
will
always
have
joy
.


A
quiet
conscience
can
endure
much
,
and
remains
joyful
in
all
trouble
,
but
an
evil
conscience
is
always
fearful
and
uneasy
.

"^([97])
The
anonymous
medieval
author
of
the
Christian
mystical
work
The
Cloud
of
Unknowing
similarly
expressed
the
view
that

profound
and
prolonged

first
cleanse
his

her]

.

"^([98])
The
medieval
Flemish
mystic
John
of
Ruysbroeck
likewise
held
that
true
conscience
has
four
aspects
that
are
necessary
to
render

in
the
active
and
contemplative
life
:

Schopenhauer
considered

^([101])
Thus
,
living
a
life
of
peaceful
conscience
means
to
Spinoza
that
reason
is
used
to
generate
adequate
ideas
where
the
mind
increasingly
sees
the
world
and
its
conflicts
,
our
desires
and
passions
sub
specie
aeternitatis
,
that
is
without
reference
to
time
.

^([102])
Hegel
'
s
obscure
and
mystical
Philosophy
of
Mind
held
that
the
absolute
right
of
freedom
of
conscience
facilitates
human
understanding
of
an
all-embracing
unity
,
an
absolute
which
was
rational
,
real
and
true
.

^([103])
Nevertheless
,
Hegel
thought
that
a
functioning
State
would
always
be
tempted
not
to
recognize
conscience
in
its
form
of
subjective
knowledge
,
just
as
similar
non-objective
opinions
are
generally
rejected
in
science
.

^([104])
A
similar
idealist
notion
was
expressed
in
the
writings
of
Joseph
Butler
who
argued
that
conscience
is
God-given
,
should
always
be
obeyed
,
is
intuitive
,
and
should
be
considered
the
"constitutional
monarch"
and
the
"universal
moral
faculty"
:
"conscience
does
not
only
offer
itself
to
show
us
the
way
we
should
walk
in
,
but
it
likewise
carries
its
own
authority
with
it
.

Butler
advanced

referring
to
a

of
regulative
principles
in
human

"benevolence"
(compassion

in

of
situational

.

Conscience
tended
to
be
more
authoritative
in
questions
of
moral
judgment

Butler
,
because
it
was
more
likely
to
be

John
Selden
in
his
Table
Talk
expressed
the
view
that
an
awake
but
excessively
scrupulous
or
ill-trained
conscience
could
hinder
resolve
and
practical
action
;
it
being
"like

influenced

Schopenhauer

hold
that

and
thoughts
;
"for
it

only
our

;
the
good

thought
Schopenhauer
,
we
experience
after
every
disinterested

arises
from
direct
recognition
of
our
own

in
the
phenomenon

it
affords
us
the

"^([110])
Kant
considered
critical
conscience
to
be
an
internal
court
in
which
our
thoughts
accuse
or
excuse
one
another
;
he
acknowledged
that
morally
mature
people
do
often
describe
contentment

peace
in
the
soul
after
following
conscience
to
perform
a
duty
,
but
argued
that
for
such
acts
to
produce
virtue
their
primary
motivation
should
simply
be
duty
,
not
expectation
of
any
such
bliss

^([111])
Rousseau
expressed
a
similar
view
that

somehow
connected

a
greater
metaphysical
unity

John

Samuel

stated
that
"No

tell

"

Other
philosophers
expressed
a
more
sceptical
and
pragmatic
view
of
the
operation
of
"conscience"
in
society
.

^([113])
John
Locke
in
his
Essays
on
the
Law
of
Nature
argued
that
the
widespread
fact
of
human
conscience
allowed
a
philosopher
to
infer
the
necessary
existence
of
objective
moral
laws
that
occasionally
might
contradict
those
of
the
state
.

^([114])
Locke
highlighted
the
metaethics
problem
of
whether
accepting
a
statement
like
"follow
your
conscience"
supports
subjectivist
or
objectivist
conceptions
of
conscience
as
a
guide
in
concrete
morality
,
or
as
a
spontaneous
revelation
of
eternal
and
immutable
principles
to
the
individual
:
"if
conscience
be
a
proof
of
innate
principles
,
contraries
may
be
innate
principles
;
since
some
men
with
the
same
bent
of
conscience
prosecute
what
others
avoid
.

"^([115])
Thomas
Hobbes
likewise
pragmatically
noted
that
opinions
formed
on
the
basis
of
conscience
with
full
and
honest
conviction
,
nevertheless
should
always
be
accepted
with
humility
as
potentially
erroneous
and
not
necessarily
indicating
absolute
knowledge
or
truth
.

^([116])
William
Godwin
expressed
the
view
that
conscience
was
a
memorable
consequence
of
the
"perception
by
men
of
every
creed
when
the
descend
into
the
scene
of
busy
life"
that
they
possess
free
will

^([117])
Adam
Smith
considered
that
it
was
only
by
developing
a
critical
conscience
that
we
can
ever
see
what

John
Stuart
Mill
believed
that
idealism
about
the
role
of
conscience
in
government
should
be
tempered
with

realisation

country

or
of
humanity

grounded
on
sympathy
or
on
a
conscientious
feeling
.

^([119])
Mill
held
that
certain
amount
of
conscience
,
and
of
disinterested
public
spirit
,
may
fairly
be
calculated
on
in
the
citizens
of
any
community
ripe
for

---------------

Josiah
Royce
(1855–1916)
built
on
the
transcendental
idealism
view
of
conscience
,
viewing
it
as
the
ideal
of
life
which
constitutes
our
moral
personality
,
our
plan
of
being
ourself
,
of
making
common
sense
ethical
decisions
.


But
,
he
thought
,
this
was
only
true
insofar
as
our
conscience
also
required
loyalty
to
"a
mysterious
higher
or
deeper
self"
.

^([120])
In
the
modern
Christian
tradition
this
approach
achieved
expression
with
Dietrich
Bonhoeffer
who
stated
during
his
imprisonment
by
the
Nazis
in
World
War
II
that
conscience
for
him
was
more
than
practical
reason
,
indeed
it
came
from
a
"depth
which
lies
beyond
a
man
'
s
own
will
and
his
own
reason
and
it
makes
itself
heard
as
the
call
of
human
existence
to
unity
with
itself
.

"^([121])
For
Bonhoeffer
a
guilty
conscience
arose
as
an
indictment
of
the
loss
of
this
unity
and
as
a
warning
against
the
loss
of
one
'
s
self
;
primarily
,
he
thought
,
it
is
directed
not
towards
a
particular
kind
of
doing
but
towards
a
particular
mode
of
being
.


It
protests
against
a
doing
which
imperils
the
unity
of
this
being
with
itself
.

^([52])
Conscience
for
Bonhoeffer
did
not
,
like
shame
,
embrace
or
pass
judgment
on
the
morality
of
the
whole
of
its
owner
'
s
life
;
it
reacted
only
to
certain
definite
actions
:
"it
recalls
what
is
long
past
and
represents
this
disunion
as
something
which
is
already
accomplished
and
irreparable"
.

^([122])
The
man
with
a
conscience
,
he
believed
,
fights
a
lonely
battle
against
the
"overwhelming
forces
of
inescapable
situations"
which
demand
moral
decisions
despite
the
likelihood
of
---------------
that
the
truth
distributed
in
the
world
,
as
the
statement
about
human
dignity
,
as
the
affirmation
of
the
line
between
good
and
evil
,
lives
in
people
as
conscience
.

---------------

As
Hannah
Arendt
pointed
out
,
however
,
(following
the
utilitarian
John
Stuart
Mill
on
this
point)
:
a
bad
conscience
does
not
necessarily
signify
a
bad
character
;
in
fact
only
those
who
affirm
a
commitment
to
applying
moral
standards
will
be
troubled
with
remorse
,
guilt
or
shame
by
a
bad
conscience
and
their
need
to
regain
integrity
and
wholeness
of
the
self
.

^([124][125])
Representing
our
soul
or
true
self
by
analogy
as
our
house
,
Arendt
wrote
that
"conscience
is
the
anticipation
of
the
fellow
who
awaits
you
if
and
when
you
come
home
.

"^([126])
Arendt
believed
that
people
who
are
unfamiliar
with
the
process
of
silent
---------------
"count
on
its
being
forgotten
the
next
moment
;"
bad
people
are
not
full
of
regrets
.

^([126])
Arendt
also
wrote
eloquently
on
the
problem
of
languages
distinguishing
the
word
consciousness
from
conscience
.


One
reason
,
she
held
,
was
that
conscience
,
as
we
understand
it
in
moral
or
legal
matters
,
is
supposedly
always
present
within
us
,
just
like
consciousness
:
"and
this
conscience
is
also
supposed
to
tell
us
what
to
do
and
what
to
repent
;
before
it
became
the
lumen
naturale
or
Kant
'
s
practical
reason
,
it
was
the
voice
of
God
.

Albert
Einstein
associated
conscience
with
suprapersonal
thoughts
,
feelings
and
aspirations
.



Albert
Einstein
,
as
a
self-professed
adherent
of
humanism
and
rationalism
,
likewise
viewed
an
enlightened
religious
person
as
one
whose
conscience
reflects
that
he
"has
,
to
the
best
of
his
ability
,
liberated
himself
from
the
fetters
of
his
selfish
desires
and
is
preoccupied
with
thoughts
,
feelings
and
aspirations
to
which
he
clings
---------------
liberty
,
obligations
should
take
precedence
over
rights
in
moral
and
political
philosophy
and
a
spiritual
awakening
should
occur
in
the
conscience
of
most
citizens
,
so
that
social
obligations
are
viewed
as
fundamentally
having
a
transcendent
origin
and
a
beneficent
impact
on
human
character
when
fulfilled
.

^([130][131])
Simone
Weil
also
in
that
work
provided
a
psychological
explanation
for
the
mental
peace
associated
with
a
good
conscience
:
"the
liberty
of
men
of
goodwill
,
though
limited
in
the
sphere
of
action
,
is
complete
in
that
of
conscience
.


For
,
having
incorporated
the
rules
into
their
own
being
,
the
prohibited
possibilities
no
longer
present
themselves
to
the
mind
,
and
have
not
to
be
rejected
.

"^([132])

Alternatives
to
such
metaphysical
and
idealist
opinions
about
conscience
arose
from
realist
and
materialist
perspectives
such
as
those
of
Charles
Darwin
.


Darwin
suggested
that
"any
animal
whatever
,
endowed
with
well-marked
social
instincts
,
the
parental
and
filial
affections
being
here
included
,
would
inevitably
acquire
a
moral
sense
or
conscience
,
as
soon
as
its
intellectual
powers
had
become
as
well
,
or
as
nearly
as
well
developed
,
as
in
man
.

"^([133])
Émile
Durkheim
held
that
the
soul
and
conscience
were
particular
forms

an
impersonal
principle
diffused
in

relevant
group

communicated
by
totemic
ceremonies

what
constitute

for
many
persons

the
specifically

or

For
others
,
however
,
an
action
seems
to
be
properly
termed

Michael
Walzer
claimed
that
the
growth
of
religious
toleration
in
Western
nations
arose
amongst
other
things
,
from
the
general
recognition
that
private
conscience
signified
some
inner
divine
presence
regardless
of
the

professed
and
from
the
general
respectability

piety

self-limitation

rights

also
argued
that

personal
moral
code

constitutional
protection

it

"Freedom

Langston
argues
that

have
unnecessarily
neglected

it
applies

Emmanuel

being

severe

In
other
words
,
the
welcoming
of
the
Other

to
Levinas
,
was
the
very
essence
of
conscience
properly
conceived
;
it
encouraged
our
ego
to
accept
the
fallibility
of
assuming
things
about
other
people
,
that
selfish
freedom
of
will
"does
not
have
the
last
word"
and
that
realising
this
has
a
transcendent
purpose
:
"I

The

pointed
out

should
not

bring

Conscience
,
according
to
Johnson
,
was
nothing
more
than
a
conviction
felt
by
ourselves
of
something
to
be
done
or
something
to
be
avoided
;
in
questions
of
simple
unperplexed
morality
,
conscience
is
very
often
a
guide
that
may
be
trusted
.

^([172])
But
before
conscience
can
conclusively
determine
what
morally
should
be
done
,
he
thought
that
the
state
of
the
question
should
be
thoroughly
known
.

^([172])
"No

said
Johnson
"can

right

Often
this
derives
from

spiritual
or

perspective
,
that
for

conscience
,
properly
understood
,
should
be
generally
considered
as
not
necessarily
linked
(often
destructively)
to
fundamentalist

but
as
an
aspect
of
universal
consciousness

access
to

Bradley
discusses
the
central
problem

Shakespeare

character

as
one
where
conscience
in
the
form

moral
scruples
deters
the
young
Prince

anxiety

do

Bradley
develops
a
theory
about
Hamlet
'
s
moral
agony
relating
to
a
conflict
between
"traditional"
and
"critical"
conscience
:
"The
conventional
moral
ideas
of
his
time
,
which
he
shared
with
the
Ghost
,
told
him
plainly
that
he
ought
to
avenge
his
father
;
but
a
deeper
conscience
in
him
,
which
was
in
advance
of
his
time
,
contended
with
these
explicit
conventional
ideas
.


It
is
because
this
deeper
conscience
remains
below
the
surface
that
he
fails
to
recognise
it
,
and
fancies
he
is
hindered

cowardice

sloth

passion

not

Types
of
Conscience

Text
:
1
Timothy
1
:5

One
of
the
goals
of
preaching/teaching
the
word
of
God
is
a
“good
conscience
.

”
Our
conscience
is
designed
to
help
guide
us
to
do
what
is
right
(“right”
depends
on
how
it
is
trained)
.


If
we
want
to
accomplish
this
goal
,
we
need
to
understand
more
about
the
conscience
.


There
are
at
least
six
different
types
of
conscience
addressed
in
the
New
Testament
.


We
will
consider
them
here
.



Good
Conscience

-
A good
conscience
is
one
which
is
free
from
guilt
–
we
are
doing

what
we
believe
to
be
right
;
used
two
different
ways
in
the
NT
(of

those
who
did
right
and
those
who
did
wrong)
-
Those
who
do
right
are
to
have
a good
conscience
(1
Timothy
1
:5)
–

keep
a
good
conscience
(1
Timothy
1
:19)
;
if
we
follow
God
,
we
can

have
confidence
,
not
fear
(1
John
3
:21
;
2
:28-29)
-
However
,
it
is
possible
to
do wrong
and
have
a good
conscience
(Acts

23
:1)
–
Paul
did
many
things
against
Christ
(Acts
26
:9-11
;
1
Timothy

1
:13-15)
;
he
believed
he
was
right
(Acts
24
:16)
-
Many
have
a good
conscience
because
they
do
what
“seems
right”
to

them
(Proverbs
14
:12)
–
but
this
is
not
enough

Defiled
Conscience

-
A defiled
conscience
is
one
which
causes
one
to
feel
guilt
for
doing

what
is
either
right
or
innocent
– right
is
something
required
by

God
(2
Timothy
3
:16-17)
; innocent
is
not
right
or
wrong
in
itself

(Romans
14
:2-3)
-
In
Corinth
,
some
had
a defiled
conscience
(1
Corinthians
8
:7)
–
much

of
the
meat
sold
in
the
markets
in
Corinth
had
been
used
previously

in
idol
worship
;
Paul
explained
that
buying/eating
it
did
not
---------------
-
However
,
those
“accustomed
to
the
idol”
could
not
separate
the
idol

worship
from
eating
(1
Corinthians
8
:7)
–
for
them
,
to
eat
would

violate
their
conscience
and
embolden
them
to
sin
(1
Corinthians

8
:10-11
;
cf
.


Romans
14
:23)
-
If
one
has
a defiled
conscience
,
they
need
to
be
patiently
taught

the
truth
(Romans
14
:1
;
cf
.


Acts
18
:26)

Seared
Conscience

-
A seared
conscience
is
one
that
no
longer
feels
guilt
for
sin
–

whether
one
followed
the
right
or
wrong
standard
,
it
is
a
conscience

that
has
been
violated
so
many
times
that
it
no
longer
works
-
The
Spirit
warned
of
those
who
would
fall
away
due
to
a seared

conscience
(1
Timothy
4
:1-2)
–
when
one
sins
,
godly
sorrow
leads
him

to
repentance
(2
Corinthians
7
:10)
;
feels
guilty
,
wants
to
be
right
-
But
when
sin
becomes persistent
and
habitual
,
guilt
is
no
longer

there
(Genesis
6
:5
;
Jeremiah
6
:15)
-
A seared
conscience
is
prevented
by
laying
aside
sin
(Hebrews
12
:1)

rather
than
continuing
in
it
(2
Timothy
3
:13)
–
if
one
has
a seared

conscience
,
little
can
be
done
until
they
have
a
change
of
heart

(Hebrews
6
:4-6)

Weak
Conscience

-
A weak
conscience
is
one
that
has
simply
not
been
trained
in
what
is

right
–
lacks
knowledge
from
God
that
provides
the
right
standard
-
In
Corinth
,
a weak
conscience
led
to
a defiled
conscience
(1

Corinthians
8
:7)
–
lacked
knowledge
;
one
can
have
a weak
conscience

and
also
have
a good
conscience
(Acts
23
:1
;
1
Timothy
1
:13)
-
The
remedy
for
a
weak
conscience
is training
in
the
word
of
God

(Hebrews
5
:14)

Evil
Conscience

-
An evil
conscience
is
one
that
has
not
been
forgiven
of
sin
(Hebrews

10
:22)
-
All
have
had
an evil
conscience
at
some
point
(Romans
3
:23)
–

forgiveness
is
found
in
Christ
(Hebrews
9
:14
;
Ephesians
1
:7)
;
this

cleanses
the evil
conscience

Clear
(Pure)
Conscience

-
A clear
(pure
,
KJV)
conscience
is
one
that
has
been
forgiven
(1

Timothy
3
:9)
–
cleansed
by
Christ
;
this
is
the good
conscience
of

those
who
do
right
(1
Timothy
1
:5
,
19
;
1
Peter
3
:16)
-
We
cannot
purify
our
conscience
on
our
own
–
must
appeal
to
God
to

do
it
(1
Peter
3
:21)
-
God
cleanses
us
when
we
obey
the
gospel
(Romans
6
:3-4)
–
continues
---------------
Conclusion

-
The
goal
of
our
instruction
is
a
“good
conscience”
–
but
goodness
is

by
God’s
standard
,
not
man’s
-
It
is
not
enough
for
us
to
think
we
are
doing
what
is
right
–
we

must
actually
be
right
;
involves
knowledge
,
obedience
,
and

forgiveness
-
We
can
have
“our
hearts
sprinkled
clean
from
an
evil
conscience”

(Hebrews
10
:22)
–
done
in
baptism
;
appeal
for
a
good
conscience
(1

Peter
3
:21)
;
receive
forgiveness
(Acts
22
:16)

November

2023]

Our
inherent
nature
of
an
evil
conscience
knows
to
do
good
and
doesn’t
.


Such
a
one
rightly
divides
the
truth
from
error
and
is
bewitched
to
disobediently
choose
error
.




1Pe

:15 
But
sanctify
the
Lord
God
in
your
hearts
[where
conscience

resides]
:
and
be
ready
always
to
give
an
answer
to
every
man
that

asketh
you
a
reason
of
the
hope
that
is
in
you
with
meekness
and
fear

[prompted
by
a
good
conscience

:

1Pe
3
:16 
Having
a
good
conscience
;
that
,
whereas
they
speak
evil
of

you
,
as
of
evildoers
,
they
may
be
ashamed
that
falsely
accuse
your

good
conversation
in
Christ
.




Heb
10
:22
Let
us
draw
near
with
a
true
heart
in
full
assurance
of

faith
,
having
our
hearts
sprinkled
from
an
evil
conscience
,
and
our

bodies
washed
with
pure
water
.



Hebrews
10
:22
is
the
only
verse
in
the
Bible
that
directly
refers
to
an
“evil
conscience
.

”
However
,
as
previously
pointed
out
,
the
Bible
abounds
with
stark
nuances
of
both
forms
of
a
good
or
evil
conscience
.


It
is
impossible
to
speak
about
specific
evil
consciences
without
juxtaposing
them
with
their
corresponding
good
conscience
.



As
we
have
seen
in
the
preceding
studies
,
a
‘good
conscience’
is
dramatically
differentiated
by
Adam
and
Eve
partaking
of
the
Tree
of
the
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
.


Subsequently
,
a
pandora’s
box
of
evil
conscience
blooms
like
leavening
in
bread
dough
.



As
such
,
Mr
Barid’s
order
of
sixteen
headings
for
his
conscience
study
does
not
descend
in
order
of
authority
,
but
rather
it
is
in
order
of
scriptural
reference
.

An
Abandoned
Conscience

Our
study
today
is
on
an
“Evil
Conscience”
,
yet
when
we
review
the
above
headings
,
the
vast
majority
of
them
are
all
aspects
of
an
evil
conscience
.


Nonetheless
,
it
is
the
Saint’s
God-given
passion
to
study
every
detail
of
His
word
,
leaving
nothing
alive
that
breathes
of
misunderstanding
and
thus
our
continuation
of
the
sixteen
mostly
evil
versions
of
our
conscience
.



Clearly
,
Adam
and
Cain
within
us
initiated
the
many
forms
of
evil
consciences
,
yet
the
first
time
the
term
is
directly
used
is
in
Hebrews
10
:22
,
the
entire
Bible
bleeding
defiled
evil
consciences
from
the
beginning
to
near
the
end
.



Hebrews
10
admonishes
us
to
remain
faithful
to
the
New
Covenant
in
Christ
and
not
regress
to
the
Laws
of
Moses
so
etched
in
our
hearts
that
we
temporarily
battle
a
dual
of
tortured
consciences
as
Paul
did
regarding
circumcision
.



---------------

Heb
10
:20 
By
a
new
and
living
way
[one
that
literally
leads
to
life

eternal]
,
which
he
hath
consecrated
for
us
,
through
the
veil
,
that
is

to
say
,
his
flesh
[revealing
the
path
to
a
more
excellent
conscience]
;

Heb
10
:21 
And
having
an
high
priest
over
the
house
of
God
;

Heb
10
:22 
Let
us
draw
near
with
a
true
heart
in
full
assurance
of

faith
,
having
our
hearts
sprinkled
[a
sprinkle
(little
by
little)
is

the
beginning
of
a
storm
,
a
flood
of
truth]
from
an
evil
conscience
,

and
our
bodies
washed
with
pure
water
.



Heb
10
:23 
Let
us
hold
fast
the
[new]
profession
of
our
faith
without
---------------
spirit
and
in
truth
.


Formally
,
Israel
worshiped
God
by
attempting
to
keep
His
laws
through
physical
washings
and
sacrifices
that
most
certainly
caused
His
people
a
good
conscience
via
those
laws
.


Yet
,
as
depicted
by
Saul
,
who
became
Paul
,
his
pricked
conscience
while
under
the
slavery
of
the
Old
Covenant
was
subliminally
aware
of
a
strange
new
conscience
opposing
most
turbulently
his
established
beliefs
.


Paul’s
boldness
became
dramatically
evident
through
his
earthquake
of
miraculous
blindness
as
he
whimpered
,
‘”Who
art
thou
,
Lord
?

”
And
the
---------------
against
the
pricks
.

’
(Acts
9)

Paul’s
conscience
was
kicking
against
the
pricks
of
his
murderous
ways
and
imploring
eyes
staring
back
at
him
upon
his
many
stonings
as
he
demanded
the
church
of
the
day
adhere
to
Moses’s
laws
;
subliminally
,
he
---------------
worship
of
God
by
the
same
laws
,
only
by
spirit
and
not
by
sweat
.


It
was
a
shift
in
how
each
of
us
now
perceived
what
constituted
an
‘evil
conscience’
and
was
earth-shattering
.


That
seismic
shift
in
how
to
live
by
the
Law
was
quickly
realized
to
be
immensely
liberating
.


Its
overpowering
joy
eclipsed
martyrdom
,
as
Steven
exemplified
in
Acts
7
.


---------------

tribe
Moses
spake
nothing
concerning
priesthood
.



Unlike
Paul
,
Moses
wasn’t
given
or
ready
to
have
his
conscience
pricked
by
a
better
conscience
by
the
holy
spirit…


Heb
7
:15 
And
it
is
yet
far
more
evident
:
for
that
after
the
---------------

unchangeable
priesthood
.



…
governed
by
a
pure
conscience
.

 


Heb
7
:25 
Wherefore
he
is
able
also
to
save
them
to
the
uttermost
that
---------------

them
.



Heb
7
:26 
For
such
an
high
priest
became
us
,
who
is
holy
,
harmless
[a

pure
conscience
casts
out
all
fear]
,
undefiled
,
separate
from
sinners
,

and
made
higher
than
the
heavens
; 

Heb
7
:27 
Who
needeth
not
daily
,
as
those
high
priests
,
to
offer
up
---------------

is
consecrated
for
evermore
.

 

Hebrews
7
highlights
the
most
profound
shift
of
a
good
conscience
to
a
means
to
attain
a
pure
conscience
through
Christ
,
our
High
Priest
.


Stephen
was
so
committed
to
the
spirit
of
a
‘good
conscience’
of
greater
purity
that
he
was
willing
to
be
martyred
.


Stephen
,
Christ
and
all
the
martyrs
of
old
,
all
died
having
acted
in
good
faith
in
accordance
with
their
consciences
defying
an
‘evil
conscience’
,
and
so
,
too
,
does
the
Bride
of
Christ
.


From
that
foundation
arises
the
focus
of
this
study
and
our
immovable
confidence…


Heb
10
:22 
Let
us
draw
near
with
a
true
heart
in
full
assurance
of

faith
,
having
our
hearts
sprinkled
from
an
evil
conscience
,
and
our

bodies
washed
with
pure
water
.



---------------
Temple
he
is
constructing
.



The
following
scriptures
annul
an
evil
conscience
.




1Jn
3
:18 
My
little
children
,
let
us
not
love
in
word
,
neither
in
---------------

assure
our
hearts
before
him
.



There
in
the
above
scripture
lies
a
conscience
that
is
a
foundation
to
rightly
discern
the
truth
,
and
in
the
below
scripture
,
the
bisection
of
choosing
by
His
will
a
good
or
evil
conscience
.




1Jn
3
:20 
For
if
our
heart
condemn
us
,
God
is
greater
than
our
heart
,
---------------

If
we
are
an
Elect
of
God
,
He
assures
us
that
our
heart
,
that
is
,
our
mind
,
will
know
the
difference
between
a
good
and
evil
conscience
,
and
our
Lord
will
provide
the
power
for
us
to
ultimately
learn
to
choose
righteously
.


---------------

his
commandments
,
and
do
those
things
that
are
pleasing
in
his
sight
.



How
easy
is
it
to
simply
ask
our
Lord
to
give
us
a
pure
conscience
in
all
that
we
think
.


If
we
thus
have
that
pure
conscience
,
we
are
keeping
all
the
commandments
of
Christ
,
and
our
hope
in
the
First
Resurrection
,
Lord
willing
,
will
be
assured
.


---------------

1Jn
3
:24 
And
he
that
keepeth
his
commandments
dwelleth
in
him
,
and
he

in
him
.


And
hereby
we
know
that
he
abideth
in
us
,
by
the
spirit
which

he
hath
given
us
[in
practising
a
good
conscience]
.



We
have
seen
that
we
can’t
have
light
without
knowing
darkness
,
and
comparably
,
a
good
conscience
without
knowing
an
evil
conscience
.


Let’s
review
some
everyday
examples
of
us
being
assailed
by
an
evil
conscience
,
namely
the
seemingly
imperishable
lust
of
the
eyes
,
the
lust
of
the
flesh
and
the
pride
of
life
.



In
the
Old
Covenant
,
an
evil
conscience
was
somewhat
foreign
to
lust
yet
still
pricked
their
consciences
.




Mat
19
:8 
He
[Christ]
saith
unto
them
[the
Apostles]
,
Moses
because
of
---------------

adultery
.

 

Wow
!


What
an
indictment
of
a
good
conscience
that
mankind
,
subliminally
from
the
beginning
,
as
did
Adam
,
Eve
and
Cain
at
heart
,
knew
by
their
subsequent
actions
of
hiding
,
revealed
an
evil
heart
against
what
constituted
a
good
conscience
.




Mat
5
:27 
Ye
have
heard
that
it
was
said
by
them
of
old
time
,
Thou
---------------

In
Matthew
5
,
Christ
is
instituting
the
spirit
of
keeping
all
His
commandments
,
resulting
in
growing
a
perfect
conscience
as
He
and
the
Father
perpetually
exist
without
contrast
.



Yet
,
like
Cain
and
Paul
,
their
consciences
beheld
a
shadowy
dichotomy
of
a
pricked
conscience
suggesting
something
(spiritually)
awry
.


With
that
same
conscience
,
Solomon
,
who
is
who
we
are
before
knowing
Christ
,
withheld
from
himself
no
lust
,
as
seen
in
Ecclesiastes
2
:10
.


Solomon
and
everyone
under
the
Old
Covenant
were
blessed
materially
for
their
lawful
dedication
to
loving
God
.


Their
physical
wealth
denoted
their
love
for
God
in
a
shadowy
good
conscience
and
was
evidence
of
their
righteous
living
.



---------------

a
blessing
and
a
curse
;

Deu
11
:27 
A
blessing
,
if
ye
obey
the
commandments
of
the
LORD
your

God
,
which
I
command
you
this
day
[and
resulting
good
conscience]
:

Deu
11
:28 
And
a
curse
,
if
ye
will
not
obey
the
commandments
of
the

LORD
your
God
[and
resulting
evil
conscience]
,
but
turn
aside
out
of

the
way
which
I
command
you
this
day
,
to
go
after
other
gods
,
which
ye

have
not
known
[and
assuredly
a
resulting
evil
conscience]
.



As
earlier
expressed
,
much
later
Achan
,
under
those
commandments
,
 knew
by
his
evil
conscience
that
he
had
done
wrong
since
he
hid
his
treasure
in
the
ground
beneath
his
tent
.


The
spirit
of
keeping
the
Lord’s
commands
was
already
evident
by
the
conviction
of
their
Old
Covenant
hearts
.



Jesus
,
being
flesh
,
lived
in
perfectly
good
conscience
,
yet
He
knew
that
He
was
subject
to
an
evil
conscience
by
virtue
of
being
tempted
to
acquiesce
with
an
evil
conscience
in
submitting
to
the
Devil’s
wiles
~
evil
was
present
within
His
flesh
as
it
is
in
us
,
yet
he
didn’t
sin
,
but
we
do
.


---------------

none
good
but
one
,
that
is
,
God
.



We
all
,
as
Solomon
,
if
given
to
honestly
study
our
consciences
,
would
conclude
that
our
lusts
are
vanity
,
a
vapour
of
joy
unable
to
be
retained
.


Solomon
came
close
to
understanding
the
misty
conclusion
of
his
polarised
conscience
,
confusing
him
while
he
did
his
best
to
live
by
the
Laws
of
Moses
,
and
yet
knew
some
unidentifiable
spirit
couldn’t
be
grasped
.


That
missing
something
was
the
unheard-of
holy
spirit
that
urges
a
pure
conscience
that
later
,
in
his
experiences
with
the
Shulamite
he
frustratingly
continued
to
see
blackness
.


Christ’s
love
isn’t
awakened
in
Solomon
and
the
world
until
He
pleases
in
the
---------------
Life’s
experiences
only
produced
struggles
against
sin
to
be
always
faced
with
the
junction
of
choosing
,
by
our
Lord’s
hand
,
a
pathway
of
either
a
good
or
evil
conscience
.




Ecc
1
:14 
I
have
seen
all
the
works
that
are
done
under
the
sun
;
and
,
---------------

Our
works
always
cause
us
to
constantly
be
vexed
by
having
to
choose
the
route
of
a
good
or
evil
conscience
.

 


Ecc
1
:15 
That
which
is
crooked
cannot
be
made
straight
:
and
that
---------------

We
are
constantly
besieged
by
the
choice
of
a
good
or
evil
pathway
of
conscience
.

 


Pro
21
:8 
The
way
of
him
that
is
laden
with
guilt
is
exceeding

crooked
;
But
as
for
the
pure
[conscience]
,
his
work
is
right
.




Ecc
1
:16 
I
communed
with
mine
own
heart
[my
conscience
!

]
,
saying
,
Lo
,

I
am
come
to
great
estate
,
and
have
gotten
more
wisdom
than
all
they

that
have
been
before
me
in
Jerusalem
:
yea
,
my
heart
had
great
---------------

knowledge
increaseth
sorrow
.

 

Without
the
holy
spirit
to
prick
our
consciences
,
when
in
Babylon
,
we
as
did
Solomon
,
experienced
an
indefinable
sorrow
where
immense
physical
prosperity
and
wives
(churches)
eluded
our
quest
for
peace
and
perfect
joy
,
always
searching
but
never
coming
to
the
truth
.


Our
dichotic
consciences
increased
sorrow
.




Ecc
2
:9 
So
I
was
great
,
and
increased
more
than
all
that
were
before
---------------

labour
:
and
this
was
my
portion
of
all
my
labour
.



There
is
some
truth
that
,
in
good
conscience
,
particularly
Solomon
in
his
time
,
and
remnants
of
us
in
Babylon
believe
that
it
is
our
right
to
pursue
any
joy
of
the
flesh
as
long
as
we
use
our
“wisdom”
to
not
---------------

With
an
elusive
Shulamite-like
epiphany
,
Solomon
was
further
vexed
by
his
conscience
.


With
classic
introspection
,
he
says
, 


Ecc
2
:11 
Then
I
looked
on
all
the
works
that
my
hands
had
wrought
,
---------------

How
utterly
frustrating
it
is
in
Babylon
when
a
mist
of
Christ’s
spirit
,
for
the
most
part
,
veils
our
conscience
.


When
given
a
Stephen-like
revelation
upon
keeping
all
the
commandments
of
God
,
a
good
conscience
hailstones
our
understanding
,
washing
away
the
multitude
of
lies
and
outshining
all
vexations
of
darkness
.


---------------
~
and
us
~
with
captivating
doctrines)
while
not
understanding
that
they
all
represent
the
same
ruling
deception
.


A
man’s
wife
mirrors
himself
as
having
a
heart
that
ensnares
his
conscience
with
evil
and
fetters
his
hands
to
‘excuse’
himself
and
hide
from
sin
(Ecc
7
:25-29)
.


She
is
the
reflection
of
his
narcissism
,
and
he
is
unwittingly
taken
by
his
own
beauty
,
having
ascended
to
heaven
unconsciously
to
presume
a
dethroning
of
God
.


While
pricked
by
a
good
conscience
,
he
is
so
easily
led
away
by
his
lust
and
conceit
to
be
god
;
flattering
himself
seems
the
more
,
at
least
,
temporal
joy
.


Like
Esau’s
fleeting
passion
to
satiate
his
famished
state
,
we
always
have
time
to
reflect
upon
our
choice
of
conscience
.


If
a
semblance
of
righteousness
resides
,
we
should
be
stabbed
through
our
liver
with
an
evil
conscience
for
not
fully
considering
the
Lord’s
commandments
.




Pro
6
:23 
For
the
commandment
is
a
lamp
;
and
the
law
is
light
;
and

reproofs
of
instruction
are
the
way
of
life
: [and
peace
through
a
good

conscience]

Pro

To
keep
thee
from
the
evil
woman
,
from
the
flattery
of
the

tongue
of
a
strange
woman [the
strange
woman
within
ruling
our

conscience]
.



Pro

Lust

her
beauty

thine
heart

neither
let
her

take
thee
with
her
eyelids

Blessed
is
the
man
that
endureth
temptation
[In
this
case

choosing
a
good
or
evil
conscience]
:
for
when
he
is
tried
,
he
shall

receive
the
crown
of
life
,
which
the
Lord
hath
promised
to
them
that

love
him

Jas

Let
no
man
say
when
he
is
tempted
,
I
am
tempted
of
God
:
for

God
cannot
be
tempted
with
evil
,
neither
tempteth
he
any
man
:
[God

doesn’t
have
an
evil
conscience
to
tempt
anybody] 

Jas
1
:14 
But
every
man
is
tempted
,
when
he
is
drawn
away
of
his
own

lust
,
and
enticed
.

 […
with
his
bias
towards
an
evil
conscience]

Jas
1
:15 
Then
when
lust
hath
conceived
,
it
bringeth
forth
sin
[and

the
knowledge
of
an
evil
conscience
that
is
amplified
to
hide
the

sin]
:
and
sin
,
when
it
is
finished
,
bringeth
forth
death

The
famous
German
philosopher
Friedrich
Nietzsche
said
,
“A
bad
conscience
is
easier
to
cope
with
than
a
bad
reputation
.

” Why
?


Because
a
bad
conscience
is
mostly
contrived
in
secret
,
whereas
a
bad
reputation
is
humiliating
and
mostly
for
everyone
to
see
.


We
are
more
likely
to
fear
another’s
condemnation
rather
than
God’s
since
God
seems
far
off
and
not
in
our
faces
.


It
is
easier
in
the
short
term
to
hide
a
bad
reputation
,
even
with
having
to
live
with
the
amplification
of
an
evil

We
can
accuse
,
excuse
and
run
and
hide
all
we
like
from
an
evil
conscience
but
are
guaranteed
to
face
the
music
of
the
last
Trump
heralding
our
judgment
,
either
in
this
age
or
the
next
.



As
stated
in
the

in

by

from
the

in
Adam
having
a
trace
of

spirit
,
we
know
,
as
Adam
proved
,
a
conscience
when
we
are
disobedient
to
God’s
laws
.


If
we
weren’t
by
default
disobedient
,
we
wouldn’t
have
known
a
good
conscience
.

and

his

prior
to
being
faced
with
a
fork
in
the
road
of
knowledge
and
thoughts
to
choose
good
or
evil
and
a
resulting
conscience
.



Conclusion

It
is
impossible
to
escape
the
God-given
choice
of
good
and
evil
and
the
corresponding
consciences
.



The
Bride
of
Christ
is
most
grateful
for
her
Lord
making
“all
things”
hers
to
experience
(1Co
3
:22)
,
the
good
equally
with
the
day
of
evil
,
to
cause
both
a
good
and
evil
conscience
to
be
astronomically
impactful
.


There
is
no
escaping
hiding
among
the
trees
and
passing
the
buck
when
discovered
,
only
to
vainly
excuse
ourselves
from
the
evil
that
we
are
---------------
Such
a
person
rightly
divides
the
truth
from
error
.


His
foundation
of
judgment
is
guided
by
the
holy
spirit
of
truth
and
,
with
a
good
conscience
,
condemns
his
warring
evil
conscience
.

l

If
we
love
lying
,
we
love
our
bias
for
an
evil
conscience
,
one
that
,
in
a
soon-coming
study
,
runs
the
grave
risk
of
a
“seared
conscience”
that
is
impervious
to
a
good
conscience
.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

 Moral
conscience is
a
part
of
the
cognitive
process
in
mind
that
tells
whether
an
act
is
morally
right
or
wrong
.


In
other
words
,
it
is
awareness
of
moral
principles
and
whether
act
done
is
in
accordance
with
these
principles
or
not
.


It
is
an
instrument
for
self-control
,
correction
and
regulation
.


The
proper
understanding
of
the
moral
conscience
is
basic
to
our
understanding
of
morality
and
to
an
ethical
conduct
.



Role
of
moral
conscience
in
ethical
behaviour
:

1
.


Right
choices
:
Human
actions
entail
free
decisions
concerning
ends
---------------

concern
making
right
choices
based
on
the
analysis
of
the
nature
of

acts
and
the
intentions
and
circumstances
that
are
involved
.


Moral

conscience
help
guide
people
to
follow
the
right
means
to
a
right

end
.


2
.


Inner
guide
:
Moral
conscience
is
our
inner
guide
and
it
helps
you

figure
out
how
to
make
good
choices
.


As
we
grow
up
,
we
learn
right

from
wrong
.


Our
moral
conscience
is
the
thought
and
feeling
we
have

that
tells
us
whether
something
is
a
right
or
wrong
thing
to
do
or

say
.


Thus
it
is
a
consistent
guide
to
ethical
decision
making
.


3
.


Source
of
information
:
The
moral
conscience
is
considered
the

proximate
norm
of
conduct
because
it
is
the
immediate
source
of

information
guiding
human
actions
.


It
directs
human
actions
so
that

a
person
can
transcend
his
animal
instincts
and
human
inclinations
.



Moral
conscience
allows
man
to
exercise
reason
and
thus
allow
an

objective
decision
and
act
based
on
right
values
.


4
.


Decision
making
:
Without
moral
conscience
a
person
would
doubt
even

the
smallest
decisions
.

Since
the
judgment
of
moral
conscience
is
a

judgment
about
how
an
action
conforms
or
does
not
conform
to
natural

law
,
then
,
it
is
obligatory
to
act
according
to
one’s
conscience
.



Although
there
are
persons
who
have
a
doubtful
conscience
which

renders
them
unable
to
decide
upon
actions
easily
.


A
well-formed

moral
conscience
is
effective
because
it
makes
practical
judgments

with
relative
ease
or
after
seeking
necessary
advice
.


5
.


Resolving
ethical
dilemmas
:
A
human
being
always
comes
across

ethical
dilemmas
in
the
decision
making
process
.


Moral
Conscience

acts
as
the
guide
for
taking
correct
decisions
when
we
have
to

choose
between
competing
sets
of
principles
in
a
given
,
usually

undesirable
or
perplexing
,
situation
.


Example
: 
Helping
accident

victims
on
your
way
to
an
interview
.


6
.


Rational
decision
:
Through
our
individual
moral
conscience
,
one

becomes
aware
of
his
deeply
held
moral
principles
,
and
motivates

accordingly
to
act
upon
those
principles
removing
conflicts
.


As
we

assess
our
character
,
our
behaviour
and
ultimately
our
self
against

those
principles
,
conscience
leads
to
proper
analysis
of
good
and

bad
of
the
situation
and
proper
evaluation
of
various
options
.


7
.


Ethical
Awareness
:
This
is
our
ability
to
recognise
ethical
values

and
principles
.


The
moral
conscience
enables
the
human
mind
to

understand
the
world
in
moral
terms
.


This
enhances
our
ability
to

make
practical
decisions
in
light
of
ethical
values
and
principles
.


---------------

important
in
public
services
.


Tostay
impartial
,
it
is
important
that

public
servants
must
object
to
any
favours
and
corrupt
activities
.



Moral
conscience
helps
in
conscientious
objection
by
making
an

individual
aware
of
the
impact
of
his
decisions
on
larger
public
.



Limitation
of
moral
conscience
in
ethical
behaviour
:

1
.


Individuality
:
Moral
conscience
is
highly
personal
and
varies
with

individuals
.


For
example
,
a
person
might
think
killing
muslim
as

moral
in
order
to
take
revenge
.


In
his
conscience
it
is
moral
to

kill
muslim
and
help
Hindu
cause
.


2
.


Social
norms
:
Moral
conscience
is
guided
by
the
social
norms
in

general
.


It
can
impact
the
ethical
thinking
of
an
individual
leading

to
unethical
behaviour
.


For
example
,
in
Islamic
countries
many
are

misguided
in
name
of
jihad
and
act
of
terrorism
is
held
moral
and
as

an
act
of
sacrifice
for
the
cause
of
religion
.


3
.


Courage
:
Despite
being
morally
conscience
about
what
is
right
,
an

individual
might
lack
courage
to
act
ethically
.


For
example
,
a
civil

servant
might
know
that
his
colleague
is
taking
bribes
,
he
may
not
---------------

etc
.


define
an
individual’s
morals
.


Thus
,
one
might
not
know
what
he

is
doing
is
immoral
.


For
example
,
a
person
might
beat
his
wife
as
in

his
conscience
mind
it
is
not
immoral
,
due
to
patriarchal
mindset
.



Thus
the
moral
conscience
plays
an
important
role
in
making
moral
decisions
and
actions
.


The
reason
behind
conscience
as
the
ultimate
,
highest
determiner
of
moral
action
and
its
authority
is
the
idea
that
when
conscience
and
all
other
principles
are
properly
understood
,
they
promote
and
motivate
us
to
act
that
are
in
accordance
with
our
nature

Few
novelists
have
captured
the
ultimate
ambiguity
of
conscience
better
than
Mark
Twain
did
in
Huckleberry
Finn
.


Jim
,
the
escaped
slave
who
accompanies
Huck
down
the
river
on
a
raft
,
is
on
a
journey
to
reunite
with
his
beloved
family
(whom
white
people
have
separated
from
him)
.


In
several
scenes
,
Huck
,
beset
with
guilt
for
not
handing
Jim
over
to
the
authorities
as
his
conscience
naggingly
instructs
him
to
,
anguishes
over
his
default
role
as
an
escapee
'
s
accomplice
.



---------------
concerned
father
figure
he
never
had
but
in
many
ways
as
a
paragon
of
virtue
,
despite
the
color
of
his
skin
,
Huck
decides
to
disobey
his
conscience
.


In
doing
so
,
he
demonstrates
the
courage
many
literary
critics
have
cited
as
constituting
the
novel
'
s
moral
climax
:

---------------


It
don
'
t
make
no
difference
whether
you
do
right
or
wrong
,
a
person
'
s

conscience
ain
'
t
got
no
sense
,
and
just
goes
for
him
anyway
.



But
because
Huck
isn
'
t
yet
mature
or
free-thinking
enough
to
triumph
---------------
freedom—which
,
despite
tremendous
personal
risks
,
Jim
so
desperately
seeks
because
of
his
dedication
to
his
wife
and
children—would
be
to
mirror
his
society
'
s
corrupted
conscience
.


Huck
'
s
safeguarding
of
Jim
from
all
the
people
who
'
d
prefer
(primarily
for
ignoble
reasons)
to
return
him
to
slavery
can
be
comprehended
as
depicting
a
true
versus
an
artificial
,
culturally-derived
conscience
.



Ernest
Hemingway
,
deeply
influenced
by
Twain
'
s
plain-spoken
style
and
---------------
definitions
of
morality
as
simplistic—and
frequently
false
.



Defining
conscience
from
a
religious
perspective

Let
'
s
now
look
at
customary
definitions
of
conscience
to
illustrate
how
they
stop
short
of
accounting
for
the
many
ambiguities
so
often
found
in
reality
,
for
what
'
s
ideal
and
what
'
s
practically
possible
can
at
times
---------------

The
literature
online
relating
particularly
to
the
oxymoronic
concept
of
an
evil
conscience
emanates
mostly
from
theology—and
we
'
ll
deal
with
this
orientation
first
.


The
approach
that
fundamentalist
religion
takes
toward
ethics
is
absolutist
,
placing
a
person
'
s
behavior
into
neat
,
---------------
all
of
its
supporting
evidence
from
Scriptures
,
Greg
Stuckey
defines
any
human
wrongdoing
as—purely
and
simply—evil
.


So
anyone
afflicted
with
such
a
presumed
immoral
conscience
will
experience
as
good
what
the
Bible
delineates
as
evil
,
and
vice
versa
.



---------------
precisely
what
they
should
be
ashamed
of
.


Rather
than
feeling
troubled
by
hurting
others
,
they
perversely
take
joy
in
it
.


Looked
at
from
this
dogmatic
ecclesiastical
stance
,
an
evil
conscience
is
synonymous
with
sinning
against
God—and
it
requires
paying
penance
to
God
if
one
is
to
be
forgiven
.

The
Evil
Conscience


“Let
us
draw
near
with
a
sincere
heart
in
full
assurance
of
faith
,

having
our
hearts
sprinkled
clean
from
an
evil
conscience
and
our

bodies
washed
with
pure
water
.

”


Hebrews
10
:22

How
could
this
be
?


A
conscience
that
is
evil
?


The
traditionalists
are
going
to
faint
when
they
hear
about
this
!


Could
it
be
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
conscience
that
directs
man
to
do
what
is
evil
instead
of
what
is
good
?


Absolutely
.


Just
as
it
is
possible
to
have
a
broken
compass
that
points
east
instead
of
north
.


---------------
continually
(Genesis
6
:5)
.


These
men
were
later
annihilated
by
the
flood
.


Think
about
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
:
do
you
think
those
guys
were
interested
in
doing
what
was
right
based
on
their
conscience
?


They
were
only
interested
in
sex
with
any
man
or
woman
they
could
find
.


Don’t
be
surprised
,
this
is
what
the
heart
,
mind
and
conscience
of
man
can
degenerate
into
.

 

The
conscience
of
man
can
be
such
that
instead
of
leading
you
to
do
what
is
right
,
it
leads
you
to
do
what
is
evil
.


Again
,
like
the
Seared
Conscience
,
you
can
either
develop
an
evil
conscience
or
be
born
with
it
.


The
difference
between
the
seared
and
evil
conscience
is
that
a
seared
conscience
is
devoid
of
guilt
or
without
regret
from
doing
what
is
wrong
,
or
the
conscience
itself
is
silent
;
an
evil
conscience
,
however
,
directs
the
heart
of
man
towards
evil
instead
of
good
,
doing
the
opposite
of
what
a
normal
,
functioning
conscience
would
do
.

 

In
theory
:
A
good
conscience
keeps
us
from
doing
wrong
because
it
is
a
voice
within
that
directs
us
towards
the
right
action
.



An
evil
conscience
desires
for
us
to
do
what
is
wrong
constantly
,
and
because
of
this
desire
,
there
is
no
guilt
associated
with
committing
whatever
evil
deed
your
heart
desires
.

 

You
would
be
surprised
to
hear
that
such
a
conscience
is
actually
quite
prevalent
in
the
Church
.


Because
it
is
easy
to
do
evil
and
still
walk
into
the
assembly
like
there
is
nothing
wrong
.


This
is
popular
at
highly
---------------
assembly
.

 

An
evil
conscience
will
keep
you
sinning
and
give
you
no
reason
to
change
.


All
the
popular 
tools
of
change
endorsed
by
the
Church
(Guilt/Shame/Conscience/Fear)
have
been
taken
out
of
your
toolbelt
.


According
to
them
,
you
will
not
be
able
to
progress
.


Without
an
overwhelming
sense
of
guilt
,
how
will
you
change
?

 
---------------
all
emotion
,
men
must
press
on
and
do
what
is
right
.


They
must
work
,
improve
,
train
and
move
towards
being
the
fully
formed

Reject
the
weak
man’s

Mantra

Reject

[evil
conscience]

Application

If
you
have
an
evil
conscience
,
you
must
do
the
opposite
of
what
your
conscience
tells
you
to
do
.


It
is
as
simple
as
that
.


If
your
conscience
is
evil
,
it
is
pulling
you
towards
evil
action
,
so
you
must
resist
your
conscience
and
oppose
it
in
order
to
do
what
is
right
.


Again
,
it
does
not
matter
if
you
feel
like
doing
what
is
right
,
or
if
you
want
to
,
or
what
your
motivation
is
,
it
only
matters
if
you
do
what
is
right
or
not
.


What
are
your
actions
?


They
can
be
good
or
evil
regardless
of
what
kind
of
conscience
you
have
.

 

Again
,
and
at
risk
of
being
overly
redundant
,
reject
the
idea
of
the
necessity
of
conscience
.

 

Conscience
is
a
tool
to
be
used
for
change
,
but
change
is
possible
without
this
tool
.


This
is
a
principle
fact
of
life
.


You
must
do
what
is
right
regardless
of
emotional
states
,
including
the
emotional
state
of
a
conscience
.


You
must
focus
and
take
action
.


Do
what
is
right
.


Be
a
Man
.



Conduct
Yourselves
Like
Men
.

Conscience
describes
two
things
–
what
a
person
believes
is
right
and
how
a
person
decides
what
is
right
.


More
than
just
‘gut
instinct’
,
our
conscience
is
a
‘moral
muscle’
.



By
informing
us
of
our values
and
principles
,
it
becomes
the
standard
we
---------------
This
is
our
ability
to
recognise
ethical
values
and
principles
.



The
medieval
philosopher Thomas
Aquinas believed
our
conscience
emerged
from synderesis
:
the
‘spark
of
conscience’
.


He
literally
meant
the
human
mind’s
ability
to
understand
the
world
in
moral
terms
.


Conscience
was
the
process
by
which
a
person
brought
the
principles
of synderesis into
a
practical
situation
through
our
decisions
.


---------------
so
we
would
know
how
to
act
virtuously
under
the
circumstances
.



A
conscience
which
is
both
well
formed
(shaped
by
education
and
experience)
and
well
informed
(aware
of
facts
,
evidence
and
so
on)
enables
us
to
know
ourselves
and
our
world
and
act
accordingly
.



Seeing
conscience
in
this
way
is
important
because
it
teaches
us
ethics
is
not
innate
.


By
continuously
working
to
understand
our
surroundings
,
we
strengthen
our
moral
muscle
.

Conscientious
Objection

In
politics
,
much
of
the
debate
around
conscience
concerns
the “right
to conscientious
objection”
.



---------------

For
a
long
time
,
Western
nations
,
informed
by
the
Catholic
intellectual
tradition
,
believed
in
the
“primacy
of
conscience”
–
the
idea
that
a
person
should
never
be
forced
to
do
something
they
believe
is
against
their
most
deeply
held
values
and
principles

Ethics

Religious
views
on
conscience

Aquinas’
Natural
moral
law
---------------
secondary
precept
that
euthanasia
is
wrong
.



Aquinas’
view
of
the
conscience

Natural
law
is
Aquinas’
theory
on
how
God
is
the
grounding
and
source
of
morality
.


Conscience
is
about
the
human
psychology
involved
in
understanding
and
applying
natural
moral
law
.


Conscience
is
ratio
(reason)
used
to
understand
and
apply
God’s
natural
law
.



Aquinas
claims
that
the
classic
features
of
conscience
follow
from
the
application
of
our
knowledge
of
the
natural
moral
law
to
our
moral
actions
,
in
three
ways
:

1
.


Witness
–
by
knowing
whether
we
have
done
or
not
done
something
.


2
.


Bind
&
incite
–
“through
the
conscience
we
judge
that
something

should
be
done
or
not
done”
3
.


Accuse
,
torment
&
rebuke
–
“by
conscience
we
judge
that
something

done
is
well
done
or
ill
done”

This
is
how
the
conscience
causes
guilt
.


Conscience
is
our
ability
to
know
whether
we
have
done
something
,
whether
we
should
have
done
it
,
and
whether
it
was
done
well
.


If
we
have
done
something
wrong
,
our
conscience
will
accuse
,
torment
and
rebuke
us
–
causing
feelings
of
guilt
.



Because
human
reason
is
fallible
,
the
conscience
thereby
becomes
fallible
.


We
could
be
mistaken
for
example
when
we
don’t know
how
a
general
rule
applies
to
a
certain
situation
(mistake
in
conscientia)
.


---------------
called
apparent
goods
because
they
only
appear
good
to
someone
engaged
in
faulty
reasoning
.


They
are
not
real
goods
.


Despite
this
potential
for
our
conscience
judging
something
bad
to
be
good
,
Aquinas
still
insists
we
must
follow
it
:

“Every
judgment
of
conscience
,
be
it
right
or
wrong
…
is
obligatory
…
he
who
acts
against
his
conscience
always
sins”

This
is
because
if
you
choose
to
act
against
your
conscience
,
then
you
are
choosing
to
do
something
you
believe
to
be
evil
.


Conscience
is
thus
always
‘binding’
.



Vincible
vs
invincible
ignorance

Whether
errors
in
conscience
that
lead
to
sinful
acts
will
be
forgiven
or
pardoned
depends
on
the
type
of
ignorance
that
caused
the
error
.



---------------
very
statement
that
man
is
estranged
from
his
created
nature
presupposes
an
experience
of
the
abyss
between
what
he
essentially
is
and
what
is
existentially
is
.


Even
a
weak
or
misled
conscience
is
still
a
conscience
,
namely
,
the
silent
voice
of
man’s
own
essential
nature
,
judging
his
actual
being”
–
Tillich
.



To
deny
that
our
conscience
can
discover
the
natural
law
is
to
claim
that
there
is
a
gap
between
what
we
currently
are
and
what
we
could
be
.


Yet
,
to
have
an
awareness
of
that
gap
is
to
have
a
conscience
that
is
aware
of
its
fallen
state
.


So
it
is
contradictory
to
deny
the
natural
law
.


Even
it
now
involves
a
weakened
conscience
,
that
still
tells
us
at
least
something
of
the
direction
we
have
fallen
in
and
the
direction
back
towards
righteousness
.



However
,
whatever
a
weak
and
misled
conscience
discovers
is
surely
not
God’s
morality
.


Humanity
believing
it
has
the
ability
to
know
anything
of
God
is
the
same
arrogance
that
caused
Adam
and
Eve
to
disobey
God
.


---------------
inability
to
be
humble
enough
to
simply
have
faith
.



Psychological
views
on
the
conscience

Sigmund
Freud

Freud
thought
the
conscience
was
just
the
result
of
psychological
forces
that
science
could
understand
.


Freud
believed
the
mind
was
divided
into
the
Id
(our
unconscious
animalistic
desires)
,
Ego
(Our
conscious
---------------
thought
responsible
for
many
mental
problems
.



The
ethical
implications
is
that
conscience
is
not
the
voice
of
God
in
us
,
it
is
just
what
our
society
wants
from
us
.


Our
society
might
be
good
or
bad
,
therefore
our
conscience
is
not
the
best
guide
if
Freud
is
right
.


Furthermore
there
might
not
even
be
a
‘good
or
bad’
,
if
morality
is
merely
the
conditioning
of
societies
on
its
members
.


---------------
Mature
genital
stage
:
lasts
until
death
.


Controlled
sexual
desires
result
in
a

for
love
and
marriage
.


A
person
now
has
a
fully
developed
conscience
where
the
ego
controls
the
Id
with
reference
to
the
superego
.



---------------
thus
be
seen
to
defend
Freud
to
some
degree
from
the
accusation
of
being
unscientific
.


He
studied
the
development
of
children
and
argued
that
there
occurs
a
fundamental
shift
in
the
nature
of
‘conscience’
.


Before
the
age
of
11
children
have
what
he
called
heteronomous
morality
.


This
means
they
merely
associate
actions
as
bad
because
of
the
influence
of
---------------
abstract
cognitive
moral
beliefs
about
how
one
ought
to
act
and
why
.

After

too
many
people

Freud

this

because
the

authority

similar
to
how
children
are

the
result

comparable

Conscience

I
.


Definition

Conscience
is
a
faculty
of
the
mind
that
motivates
us
to
act
morally—or
at
least
according
to
our
most
deeply
held
values
.

 
Most
say
it
is
a
form
of
intuition
and
uses
emotion
,
although
others
have
argued
that
it
should
be
shaped
by
reason
.

 
It
is
a
private
experience
,
and
a
form
of
self-knowledge
;
from
one’s
conscience
one
can
learn
one’s
own
values
and
morals
.

 
This
is
the
root
of
the
word
,
from
the
latin
con-scientia
,
perhaps
translatable
as
“together-with-knowing”
–
to
be
together
with
one’s
knowledge
(of
morality)
.



Yet
,
conscience
has
been
thought
by
many
to
be
informed
by
an
objective
morality
,
with
divine
,
transcendental
,
or
natural
sources
.

 
Even
in
our
society
,
where
we
ostensibly
recognize
the
cultural
and
personal
relativity
of
morality
,
conscience
is
granted
a
special
status
,
with
laws
protecting
the
rights
of
doctors
and
others
not
to
violate
their
consciences
.

 
So
,
conscience
is
private
,
subjective
,
and
culturally
relative
,
but
carries
legal
and
political
weight
.



There
are
many
different
ideas
about
conscience—religious
,
philosophical
,
scientific
,
legal
,
and
popular
:

-
Religious
:
in
most
religions
,
the
morality
that
informs
conscience

does
or
should
come
from
either
God
,
or
an
enlightened
mind
.



Religions
differ
as
to
whether
conscience
is
thought
of
mainly
as
a

punisher
(e
.

g
.


Catholic)
or
as
a
virtue
to
be
cultivated
(e
.

g
.



Protestant
,
Buddhist)
.


-
Philosophical
:
many
philosophers
have
written
that
a
truly
moral

conscience
requires
the
exercise
of
reason
;
others
have
claimed
that

it
is
an
intuition
of
objective
moral
truth
.


Pre-modern
philosophers

tended
to
believe
in
a
natural
and
objective
morality
informing

conscience—something
like
a
truly
moral
instinct
.

 
Modern

philosophers
tend
to
recognize
the
cultural
and
individual

relativity
of
morality
,
and
many
present
arguments
based
on
---------------
-
Scientific
:
such
as
theories
in
evolutionary
psychology
,
cognitive

science
,
and
sociology
.


-
Legal
:
Our
society
seems
to
recognize
“freedom
of
conscience”
–
that

we
should
be
free
to
obey
our
consciences
–
within
limits
.



Considering
that
we
don’t
have
a
clear
or
unified
philosophy
of

conscience
,
this
raises
legal
,
political
,
and
social
issues
.


-
Popular
:
Our
everyday
notions
of
conscience
are
philosophically

interesting
.


Consider
that
conscience
is
a
part
of
us
opposing

actions
that
we
ourselves
apparently
already
consider
immoral
,
but

are
in
danger
of
doing
anyway
.

 
It
seems
a
little
paradoxical
.

 
Why

do
we
need
a
conscience
?


Evolutionary
theory
most
likely
has
the

answer
(see
“History”
section)

Thought
about
conscience
is
so
diverse
and
complex
that
a
comprehensive
treatment
is
not
possible
.


This
seems
another
paradox
about
conscience
;
we
know
it
most
intimately
in
ourselves
,
but
there
is
no
consensus
about
where
it
comes
from
,
or
how
much
it
should
be
respected
.

Controversies
about
Conscience

Freedom
of
conscience
is
part
of
the
United
Nations’
Declaration
of
Human
Rights
,
and
the
laws
of
many
nations
.

 
Yet
we
have
reason
to
question
the
idea
.

 
Former
Nazi
generals
have
told
interviewers
that
they
acted
with
a
clear
conscience
,
because
their
actions
were
sanctioned
by
their
leadership
and
society
.

 
This
would
be
consistent
with
ideas
about
conscience
as
a
social
instinct
,
but
not
necessarily
an
altruistic
one
as
Darwin
thought—perhaps
conscience
merely
urges
us
to
conform
with
the
mores
of
our
society
or
belief-systems
.



Freedom
of
conscience
is
problematic
because
it’s
perfectly
possible
for
people’s
consciences
to
insist
on
actions
that
most
of
consider
harmful
to
other
human
beings—such
as
refusing
to
vaccinate
their
children
.



There
are
several
traditional
arguments
in
favor
of
freedom
of
conscience
:

-
The
argument
from
hypocrisy
or
ineffectiveness
:
Most
people
agree

that
it
is
impossible
to
change
a
person’s
conscience
from
the

outside
;
therefore
,
not
granting
freedom
of
conscience
means

requiring
people
to
act
contrary
to
their
beliefs
,
which
seems

wrong
.


This
was
a
reason
to
consider
persecuting
heretics
---------------

However
,
the
argument
from
hypocrisy
can
be
turned
around
;
if
you
can’t
change
a
person’s
conscience
,
then
they
still
have
freedom
of
conscience
,
even
if
you
force
them
to
behave
in
a
certain
way
.



-
The
argument
from
ignorance
:
This
is
based
on
the
recognition
of

relativism
and
subjectivism
.


If
our
consciences
don’t
give
us

objective
moral
guidance
,
then
you
can’t
assume
that
yours
is
right

and
another’s
wrong
,
therefore
you
don’t
have
a
right
to
deny
them

freedom
of
conscience
.


-
The
argument
from
legitimization
:
John
Stuart
Mill
argued
that
it
is

best
for
society
if
all
people
express
their
convictions
freely
,
for
---------------

However
,
none
of
these
arguments
completely
addresses
the
conflicts
between
freedom
of
conscience
and
public
well-being
.

 
Some
might
say
that
a
doctor
who
refuses
to
perform
a
life-saving
operation
out
of
conscience
should
be
charged
with
negligence
or
even
manslaughter
.

 
While
others
might
feel
that
performing
the
operation
is
murder
.


The
precise
limits
of
freedom
of
conscience
are
still
an
open
debate
with
profound
consequences
.

A

The
Essential
Writings
---------------

This
quote
seems
to
represent
the
way
most
of
us
naturally
think
of
conscience—assuming
that
conscience
is
always
right
,
as
if
it’s
a
direct
line
to
God
or
some
other
source
of
objective
moral
knowledge
.

 
This
also
implies
that
it
is
right
to
obey
conscience
even
if
opposes
one’s
social
and
legal
environment
.

 
One
the
one
hand
,
these
could
be
incorrect
and
dangerous
assumptions
;
on
the
other
,
we
could
never
change
injustice

without
sometimes
trusting

Types
of
Conscience

There
are
no
‘types
of
conscience’
recognized
by
philosophers
except
‘critical
conscience’
which
means
the
application
of
critical
reasoning
to
ethical
decisions
.

 
Many
religious
web-pages
list
their
own
types
of
conscience
,
in

of
their
beliefs

Conscience
versus
Sociopathy

Sociopaths
are
,
arguably
,
individuals
with
no
conscience
.

 
They
are
also
defined
as
incapable
of
feeling
empathy
,
guilt
,
fear
,
or
shame
at
hurting
others
or
violating
any
notion
of
morality
.

conscience
is
innate
in
normal
humans

History
of
Conscience

Before
cultural
relativity
and
subjectivism
came
into
vogue
during
the
20^(th)
century
,
conscience
was
considered
a
source
of
objective
moral
knowledge
by
almost
everyone
,
however
in
different
senses
in
different
cultures
.

 
In
ancient
Hinduism
,
Buddhism
,
and
Taoism
,
knowledge
of
good
---------------
more
likely
a
source
of
sin
than
morality
.

 
Instead
,
obedience
to
God’s
law
is
thought
the
only
true
morality
.

 
This
would
mean
that
true
conscience
is
knowledge
of
God’s
law
,
whether
that
comes
directly
from
God
,
or
through
obedience
to
scripture
or
clergy
;
all
these
possibilities—direct
revelation
,
scripture
,
and
obedience
to
authorities–have
been
claimed
as
the
source
of
moral
knowledge
in
these
religions
.

 
However
,
in
practice
,
these
religions
also
teach
purification
of
the
mind
to
attain
true
conscience
;
where
Eastern
religions
teach
that
a
pure
mind
allows
the
truth
to
emerge
from
within
one’s
own
consciousness
,
most
versions
of
the
Abrahamic
religions

a
---------------

Despite
the
emphasis
on
blind
obedience
in
Christianity
,
medieval
Christian
philosophers
developed
a
theory
of
conscience
with
a
strong
role
for
both
intuition
and
reasoning
.

 
St
.


Bonaventure
and
St
.


Aquinas
wrote
of
synderesis
–
a
divine
spark
of
moral
knowledge
–
which
could
---------------
perspective
of
eternity
,
with
a
peaceful
mind
,
you
will
perceive
moral
truth
.

  
Kant
also
regarded
critical
reasoning
as
an
important
element
of
conscience
,
believing
that
moral
truth
could
be
evaluated
objectively
in
light
of
his
‘categorical
imperative
.

’ 
Other
18^(th)
century
philosophers
believed
that
conscience
was
purely
intuitive
,
excluding
reason
,
but
like
Kant
,
many
of
them
also
believed
in
the
objectivity
of
the
moral
truth
informing
conscience
.



From
the
18^(th)
century
on
,
increasing
numbers
of
philosophers
spoke
for
pragmatic
and
relativistic
ideas
about
conscience
.

 
John
Locke
wrote
about
how
a
moral
conscience
might
oppose
the
laws
of
the
state
,
and
Thomas
Hobbes
insisted
that
opinions
based
on
conscience
could
easily
be
wrong
or
in
contradiction
to
other
people’s
consciences
.

 
So
,
these
and
other
philosophers
also
advocated
for
a
‘critical
conscience’–and
some
skepticism
about
the
dictates
of
conscience
in
general
.



In
the
19^(th)
century
,
Darwin
hypothesized
that
conscience
evolved
to
resolve
conflicts
between
instincts
,
such
as
between
instincts
for
self-preservation
and
instincts
to
protect
and
cooperate
with
other
human
beings
.



In
the
20^(th)
century
,
Freud
analyzed
conscience
as
an
effect
of
the
super-ego
;
as
we
grow
up
,
natural
instincts
such
as
aggression
and
sexual
desire
must
be
frequently
frustrated
,
and
even
punished
,
by
---------------
them
.



Where
Darwin
said
that
conscience
evolved
to
resolve
inner
conflicts
,
other
more
recent
evolutionary
psychologists
suggest
that
it
evolved
to
motivate
altruistic
behavior
,
which
is
now
thought
to
be
evolutionarily
adaptive
for
social
creatures
.



Few
today
would
claim
that
conscience
is
a
source
of
objective
morality
,
divine
,
transcendental
or
otherwise
,
since
it
is
obvious
that
two
people’s
consciences
or
religions
can
dictate
opposing
moralities—such
as
pro-choice
and
pro-life
.

  
Therefore
,
philosophers
today
are
more
concerned
with
exploring
the
consequences
of
this
relativity
of
conscience
,
especially
since
people
still
seem
to
think
of
conscience
as
objectively
true
,
sacred
,
and
inviolable
.


Which
leads
naturally
to
our
controversy
–
“freedom
of
conscience
.

Pinocchio

In

from
the
old
Disney
Pinocchio
film
,
Jiminy
Cricket
gives

who

a
lecture
and
song
about
conscience
with
the
message
“always
let
your
conscience
be
your
guide
.

” 
Although
that
message
implies
relying
on
intuitive
conscience
,
it’s
interesting
that
the
Cricket
first
tries
to
explain
something
like
‘critical
conscience’
to
Pinocchio
before
giving
up
in
confusion
and
falling
back
on
a
traditional
Christian
notion
of
conscience—resistance
to
temptation
.

Introduction

Each
of
us
has
,
at
one
time
or
another
,
talked
about
our
conscience
.


We
might
have
been
“pricked
by
our
conscience”
or
our
conscience
might
have
“butted
in”
when
it
was
not
wanted
.


We
might
be
going
on
quite
happily
telling
a
lie
to
a
friend
,
or
might
have
accidentally
walked
out
of
a
shop
without
paying
for
something
and
it
is
our
conscience
that
makes
us
confess
or
stops
us
in
our
tracks
spins
us
on
our
heels
and
takes
us
back
into
the
shop
.



People
from
different
walks
of
life
talk
of
the
“conscience”
,
from
the
religious
believer
,
the
politician
,
the
celebrity
,
to
every
day
folk
;
we
might
hear
someone
berate
their
conscience
for
nagging
them
to
do
something
they
do
not
want
to
.


People
might
be
labelled
“conscientious
objectors”
because
they
feel
their
conscience
is
telling
them
to
object
to
certain
political
actions
,

A
protester
might
lament
the
erosion
of
their
“freedom
of
conscience”
.


And
we
can
find
concepts
very
similar
to
“conscience”
in
many
non-Christian
religious
traditions
both
Eastern
and
Western
throughout
history
and
from
around
the
globe
.

However
,
the
nature
of
conscience
is
obscure
and
consequently
the
philosophical
discussion
of
conscience
is
complex
and
has
a
long
history
.


It
draws
on
issues
in
philosophical

religion
,
epistemology
,

,

In
this
chapter
we’ll
give
a
general
overview
of
two
theories
of
conscience
.


One
draws
on
Aquinas’s
account
;
the
other
Sigmund
Freud’s
(1856–1939)
.


Although
Freud
is
not
typically
seen
as
a
philosopher
(he’s
a
psychologist)
his
account
will
provide
us
with
some
insights
which
allows
us
to
think
philosophically
about
this
thing
we
call
“the
conscience”
.

.


The
History
of
Conscience

In
the
twenty-first
century
conscience
is
not
thought
of
as
solely
a
religious
idea
.


However
talk
of
“conscience”
was
popularised
,
at
least
in
“the
West”
,
due
to
its
adoption
by
both
Protestant
and
Catholic
traditions
.


In
this
section
we’ll
look
how
“conscience”
is
,
and
has
been
,
used
in
order
to
draw
out
some
general
features
.



“Conscience”
played
a
role
in
one
of
the
most
famous
speeches
in
the
protestant
reformation
.


Martin
Luther
(1483–1546)
,
being
charged
with
heresy
and
being
forced
to
recant
by
Charles
V
,
stands
his
grounds
and
says
“Here
I
stand
,
I
can
do
no
other”
and
“I
cannot
nor
will
I
retract
anything
,
since
it
is
never
safe
nor
virtuous
to
go
against
conscience”
.


Luther
believed
that
his
God-given
conscience
was
not
allowing
him
to
recant
,
not
even
under
the
considerable
pressure
by
the
powerful
people
before
him
.


Or
consider
a
more
recent
example
.


---------------
his
views
said
:

But
,
conscience
asks
the
question
,
is
it
right
?


And
there
comes
a
time
when
we
must
take
a
position
that
is
neither
safe
,
nor
politic
,
nor
popular
,
but
one
must
take
it
because
it
is
right
.

2

Conscience
is
,
then
,
powerful
.


It
seems
that
it
can
move
a
person
to
put
themselves
in
mortal
danger
,
to
“stand
up
and
be
counted”
,
to
act
contrary
to
self-interest
.



But
it
is
not
just
saints
and
heroes
that
talk
of
conscience
,
conscience
has
been
cited
by
the
most
repugnant
and
morally
abhorrent
people
who
have
ever
lived
,
racists
,
murderers
,
tyrants
,
dictators
.


For
example
as
Bettina
Stangneth’s
states
in
Eichmann
Before
Jerusalem
:
The
Unexamined
Life
of
a
Mass
Murderer
,3
a
discussion
of
the
inner
life
of
one
of
the
Nazi’s
most
notorious
officers
:
“Conscience
was
simply
the
‘morality
of
the
Fatherland
that
dwells
within’
a
person
,
which
Eichmann
also
termed
‘the
voice
of
the
blood’”
.



Conscience
can
be
male
or
female
or
both
or
neither
,
it
can
be
one
voice
or
many
,
it
can
echo
religious
ideas
,
social
ideas
,
racist
ideas
,
lofty
ideas
or
ideas
found
in
the
filth
of
human
corruption
.


Conscience
can
develop
at
any
particular
age
and
dissipates
at
any
age
.


It
does
not
“speak”
,
and
it
does
“speak”
,
and
does
not
have
a
language
of
choice
.


---------------

There
seem
to
be
(at
least)
three
related
functions
that
we
think
the
conscience
plays
.


First
,
it
tells
us
what
we
ought
to
do
as
a
guide
for
our
lives
.


Second
,
it
is
a
source
of
moral
knowledge
.


That
is
,
we
might
say
“I
know
that
stealing
a
pen
is
wrong
because
my
conscience
told
me”
.


Third
it
might
be
thought
of
as
a
motivation
.


That
is
,
it
might
be
the
thing
that
actually
gets
us
up
out
of
our
seat
to
act
in
certain
ways
,
---------------

Just
to
clarify
,
we
can
see
the
difference
in
the
first
two
of
these
functions
if
we
think
of
a
tyrant
who
says
for
example
:
“my
conscience
tells
me
I
have
to
kill
all
mentally
ill
people
to
help
the
country”
.


Clearly
this
is
a
case
where
her
conscience
is
telling
her
how
she
ought
to
behave
.


But
,
given
that
we
think
that
killing
the
mentally
ill
is
morally
wrong
,
we
do
not
want
to
say
that
in
this
case
her
conscience
gives
her
knowledge
of
what
is
right
and
wrong
.


So
it
might
be
true
that
the
conscience
gives
us
guidance
but
not
knowledge
.



Equally
the
opposite
seems
true
,
that
we
might
know
what
is
right
and
wrong
yet
fail
to
be
guided
to
do
it
.


This
predicament
is
what
Shakespeare
captured
in
this
famous
quotation
:
“conscience
doth
make
cowards
of
us
all”
(Hamlet
3
.

1
.

78–82)
.



Consider
another
point
.


Conscience
is
subjective
in
that
it
is
about
one
reflecting
inwards
on
oneself
,
on
how
one
might
“feel”
about
certain
things
.


It
is
not
about
looking
out
into
the
world
,
at
a
set
of
rules
or
laws
.


We
experience
the
conscience
differently
than
we
would
if
a
friend
,
priest
,
politician
or
Imam
was
telling
us
what
to
do
.


Of
course
,
although
conscience
is
“inward
looking”
,
that
is
not
the
same
as
saying
that
we
just
make
up
what
the
conscience
allegedly
tells
us
.


For
instance
,
we
might
think
that
what
is
right
and
wrong
is
dependent
on
God
but
also
think
that
we
come
to
know
what
is
right
and
wrong
through
our
conscience
.



Finally
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
term
“conscience”
was
only
formalized
in
its
modern
moral
meaning
in
the
mid
eighteenth
century
(e
.

g
.


neither
Plato
nor
Aristotle
talk
of
conscience)
.


However
,
note
that
just
because
a
term
is
modern
,
or
just
because
there
is
disagreement
with
how
a
term
is
used
,
that
does
not
mean
that
the
ideas
---------------
scientific
community
.


This
in
itself
does
not
lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
there
are
no
molecules
and
no
atoms
.


So
the
lack
of
term
“conscience”
,
and
disagreement
about
what
“conscience”
means
does
not
mean
that
conscience
is
merely
an
“invention”
.


With
all
these
points
in
mind
let’s
consider
one
of
the
key
thinkers
in
relation
to
conscience
,
Aquinas
.

Aquinas
on
Conscience

If
you
recall
from
Aquinas
developed
a
Natural
Law
theology
.


The
basic
---------------

They
show
that
the
requirements
of
the
law
are
written
on
their
hearts
,
their
consciences
also
bearing
witness
,
and
their
thoughts
sometimes
accusing
them
and
at
other
times
even
defending
them
.

4

Notice
then
that
for
Paul
—
and
Aquinas
—
the
“conscience”
bears
witness
sometimes
accusing
the
person
,
sometimes
defending
them
.


For
Aquinas
conscience
is
morally
neutral
,
it
simply
“bears
witness”
,
it
is
a
“sign-post”
and
after
all
signposts
do
not
opinions
on
things
(see
Aquinas
,
Summa
,
Part
1
,
Question
79
,
Article
13)
.



To
be
clear
then
Aquinas
did
not
take
conscience
to
be
a
source
of
moral
knowledge
but
as
a
guide
.


This
means
that
Aquinas
,
unlike
Luther
and
post-reformation
thinkers
,
took
conscience
to
be
fallible
.


For
Aquinas
we
may
be
wrong
in
following
our
conscience
as
it
can
move
us
in
the
wrong
direction/mislead
us

For
Aquinas
the
conscience
is
the
act
of
applying
the
universal
principles
(the
Eternal/Divine
law)
to
actual
real
life
situations
.



Aquinas
explicitly
defines
“conscience”
as
the
“application
of
knowledge
to
activity”
(Summa
Theologica
,
I–II
,
I)
.


So
,
if
conscience
for
Aquinas
is
about
the
application
of
knowledge
to
activity
,
this
raises
the
question
how
we
get
this
knowledge
?


This
is
where
another
key
technical
term
is
introduced
.


The
synderesis
.


Synderesis
is
not
the
same
as
conscience
but
is
the
innate
ability
of
the
mind
—
what
he
calls
a
habit
of
the
mind
—
to
apprehend
the
eternal/divine
laws
.


The
role
of
conscience
is
to
apply
the
primary
precepts
discovered
as
the
content
of
synderesis
.



---------------
reflection
they
will
see
that
it
is
the
straight
line
.


This
“coming
to
recognize
through
reflection”
is
what
Aquinas
has
in
mind
when
he
talks
about
synderesis
.


For
Aquinas
,
unlike
conscience
,
synderesis
is
never
mistaken
.


Humans
do
wrong
,
thinks
Aquinas
,
when
conscience
(and
not
synderesis)
makes
a
mistake
.


This
means
that
a
failure
of
conscience
needs
to
be
clearly
thought
through
on
Aquinas’s
account
.



For
Aquinas
,
conscience
errs
because
of
ignorance
about
how
to
apply
the
eternal/divine
laws
,
of
which
there
are
two
types
.


Ignorance
that
can
be
overcome
by
using
one’s
reason
(vincible
ignorance)
,
and
ignorance
that
---------------
Invincible
ignorance
is
doing
something
wrong
when
one
could
not
have
known
better
;
vincible
ignorance
is
doing
wrong
when
one
ought
to
have
known
better
.


But
how
might
this
relate
to
conscience
?



Imagine
two
people
going
into
a
gun
shop
.


The
first
person
has
no
---------------
and
they
have
no
record
of
mental
illness
.


He
is
,
for
all
intents
and
purposes
,
a
model
citizen
.


This
person
buys
a
gun
and
goes
on
a
killing
rampage
.


The
owner
of
the
shop
,
by
following
her
conscience
,
has
not
done
something
morally
wrong
because
her
ignorance
is
invincible
;
there
was
no
indication
that
this
would
have
been
a
likely
outcome
.


---------------
This
contrasts
to
the
person
who
is
sold
a
gun
even
though
he
has
a
violent
criminal
record
which
would
have
shown
up
on
a
basic
background
check
.


In
this
case
,
the
owner
of
the
gun
shop
following
her
conscience
has
done
something
morally
wrong
because
in
this
case
her
ignorance
is
vincible
.


---------------
and
wrong
through
synderesis
.


However
,
even
though
we
are
infallible
about
this
,
we
can
,
and
do
,
make
mistakes
in
applying
this
knowledge
.


It
is
our
conscience
(conscientia)
which
tells
us
how
to
apply
this
knowledge
and
moves
us
to
act
.


It
can
go
wrong
through
ignorance
.


Ignorance
which
could
have
been
avoided
(vincible)
means
our
action
is
---------------

In
the
next
section
,
we
will
consider
what
Freud
has
to
say
about
conscience
,
and
explain
how
he
reconceptualises
it
as
a
psychological
and
not
theological
concept
,
and
in
doing
so
argues
we
should
not
accept
it
as
an
inherently
good
notion
.

Freud
and
the
Conscience

Freud
is
best
known
as
a
psychologist
and
the
architect
of
---------------
talk
in
the
form
of
a
“Freudian
slip”
.


Among
Freud’s
many
ideas
his
conceptualization
of
the
structure
of
the
mind
is
key
to
his
views
on
conscience
.


He
thinks
the
mind
can
be
thought
of
as
containing
three
parts
:
the
id
,
the
ego
and
the
super-ego
.


Freud’s
account
of
conscience
is
understood
as
the
relation
between
these
.



---------------
from
the
super-ego
.



Where
does
the
conscience
come
in
?


For
Freud
the
conscience
is
the
form
that
the
super-ego
takes
in
addressing
the
ego
.


When
the
internalized
authority
derived
from
parental
(social/religious)
rules
and
regulations
controls
the
ego
is
it
is
understood
as
“the
conscience”
.


In
our
last
example
it
is
our
“conscience”
that
tells
us
to
remove
our
elbows
from
the
table
.



Notice
then
that
our
conscience
often
requires
certain
things
from
us
which
we
fail
to
achieve
and
this
gives
rise
to
guilt
.


For
Freud
,
the
conscience
can
be
thought
of
as
synonymous
with
the
“guilty
conscience”
.


Our
ego
is
punished
through
guilt
by
the
form
of
the
super-ego
we
call
conscience
.


Furthermore
,
Freud
says
that
when
the
super-ego
fails
to
deal
properly
with
the
id
—
when
the
pleasure
principle
is
repressed
—
this
forms
what
he
calls
neurosis
.



You
can
also
hopefully
see
the
differences
between
Aquinas
and
Freud
.


First
,
the
obvious
point
is
that
for
Freud
the
conscience
is
not
the
voice
of
God
.


Second
,
unlike
Aquinas
,
Freud
thinks
that
the
conscience
could
be
bad
,
destructive
and
unhelpful
.


The
conscience
is
the
way
the
ego
experiences
the
authority
of
the
super-ego
.


But
the
super-ego
is
arrived
at
through
the
experiences
we
have
.


And
,
of
course
,
we
might
have
had
really
bad
experiences
growing
up
where
parents
are
stifling
,
overly
authoritarian
,
distant
,
cold
,
hard
,
violent
,
abusive
etc
.


In
these
sorts
of
cases
the
conscience
would
be
stifling
,
overly
authoritarian
,
distant
,
etc
.


This
means
that
although
Freud
does
not
think
we
can
,
or
should
,
get
rid
of
the
conscience
he
does
think
we
should
treat
it
with
a
healthy
dose
of
scepticism
and
hence
not
be
kowtowed
by
the
“guilt”
that
is
our
ego’s
punishment
for
falling
short
of
the
super-ego
;
conscience
is
the
product
of
our
often
non-ideal
upbringing
rather
than
a
divinely-inspired
force
for
good
.



---------------
generally
,
a
pursuit
of
pleasure
and
happiness
.


People
become
sexually
active
,
fall
in
love
and
get
married
.


This
is
the
stage
where
we
acquire
a
fully
developed
conscience
.



SUMMARY

The
notion
of
“conscience”
has
appeared
for
thousands
of
years
in
different
cultures
,
even
though
it
has
not
always
been
called
“conscience”
.


Modern
Christian
orthodoxy
popularised
it
and
characterised
it
in
relation
to
God’s
voice
,
and
guidance
.


Aquinas
thought
that
conscience
is
the
way
we
understand
how
to
apply
what
we
know
.


In
Aquinas’s
view
,
our
conscience
is
fallible
and
might
guide
us
wrongly
.


When
our
conscience
“gets
it
wrong”
we
can
be
either
culpable
—
through
vincible
ignorance
—
or
not
culpable
—
through
invincible
ignorance
.



Freud
is
less
convinced
that
conscience
is
a
force
for
good
,
and
he
is
certain
that
it
has
not
got
anything
to
do
with
God
.


For
Freud
conscience
can
be
either
a
good
or
bad
.


We
can
think
of
our
mind
as
having
three
parts
,
the
id
,
ego
and
super-ego
.


The
conscience
for
Freud
is
the
form
the
super-ego
takes
when
it
is
trying
to
keep
the
ego
in
line
.


It
is
internalized
as
the
voice
of
authority
.


The
super-ego
is
about
following
rules
but
those
rules
do
not
come
from
“on
high”
,
they
derive
from
the
upbringing
we
have
had
.


So
if
we
have
had
a
repressive
upbringing
then
the
super-ego
—
the
voice
of
conscience
—
will
be
repressive
.


How
we
develop
these
three
features
of
the
mind
is
through
what
Freud
calls
Psychosexual
Development
;

we
do
not
develop

conscience
,
a
personal
sense
of
the
moral
content
of
one’s
own
conduct
,
intentions
,
or
character
with
regard
to
a
feeling
of
obligation
to
do
right
or
be
good
.


Conscience
,
usually
informed
by
acculturation
and
instruction
,
is
thus
generally
understood
to
give
intuitively
authoritative
judgments
regarding
the
moral
quality
of
single
actions
.


---------------
a
faculty
.


Ancient
Egyptians
,
for
example
,
were
urged
not
to
transgress
against
the
dictates
of
the
heart
,
for
one
“must
stand
in
fear
of
departing
from
its
guidance
.

”
In
some
belief
systems
,
conscience
is
regarded
as
the
voice
of
God
and
therefore
a
completely
reliable
guide
of
conduct
:
among
the
Hindus
it
is
considered
“the
invisible
God
who
dwells
within
us
.

”
Among
Western
religious
groups
,
the
Society
of
Friends
(or
Quakers)
places
particular
emphasis
on
the
role
of
conscience
in
apprehending
and
responding
through
conduct
to
the
“Inner
Light”
of
God
.



Outside
the
context
of
religion
,
philosophers
,
social
scientists
,
and
psychologists
have
sought
to
understand
conscience
in
both
its
individual
and
universal
aspects
.


The
view
that
holds
conscience
to
be
an
innate
,
intuitive
faculty
determining
the
perception
of
right
and
wrong
is
called
intuitionism
.


The
view
that
holds
conscience
to
be
a
cumulative
and
subjective
inference
from
past
experience
giving
direction
to
future
conduct
is
called
empiricism
.


The
behavioral
scientist
,
on
the
other
hand
,
may
view
the
conscience
as
a
set
of
learned
responses
to
particular
social
stimuli
.


Another
explanation
of
conscience
was
put
forth
in
the
20th
century
by
Sigmund
Freud
in
his
postulation
of
the
superego
.


According
to
Freud
,
the
superego
is
a
major
element
of
personality
that
is
formed
by
the
child’s
incorporation
of
moral
values
through
parental
approval
or
punishment
.


The
resulting
internalized
set
of
prohibitions
,
condemnations
,
and
inhibitions
is
that
part
of
the
superego
known
as
conscience
.

What
Does
“Conscience”
Mean
?



Conscience
/ˈkɑːnʃəns/
is
a
noun
that
refers
to
the
“inner
feeling

voice
that
tells

what
is
morally
right

impels
us

I
advised
my
niece
to
let
her
conscience
guide
her
.



When
someone
has
a
guilty
conscience
,
it
means
that
“they
feel
guilty
about
something
they
did
that
they
perceive
as
wrong
.

”


My
guilty
conscience
kept
me
up
all

On

side

spectrum

when
someone
has
a
clear
conscience
,
they
feel
that
they
did
the
right
thing
and
therefore
feel
no
guilt

Our
conscience
can
be
described
as
our
knowledge
of
ourselves
,
our
awareness
of
the
moral
principles
we
are
committed
to
,
and
our
motivation
to
act
.



One
of
the
most
fundamental
teachings
in
the
Catholic
tradition
is
the
primacy
of
conscience
.


This
doctrine
states
that
Catholics
must
use
their
reason
to
discern
ethically
complex
situations
and
that
our
individual
consciences
should
be
the
final
arbiter
in
all
moral
decision-making
.



The
Catechism
of
the
Catholic
Church
states
that
we
have
the
right
to
act
in
conscience
and
in
freedom
to
make
moral
decisions
and
that
no
one
should
be
forced
to
act
contrary
to
their
consciences
.



As
Catholics
,
we
believe
that
we
must
use
all
of
the
resources
available
to
us
to
form
our
consciences
so
that
we
can
make
the
best
possible
decisions
for
ourselves
,
particularly
in
morally
complex
circumstances
.


We
believe
this
is
particularly
essential
when
making
choices
regarding

Catholics

Choice
fights
for
the
rights
of
all
individuals
to
make
decisions
regarding
sexual
and
reproductive
health
based
on
their
own
consciences
.


But
we
are
conscious
of
the
fact
that
poverty
,
racism
and
other
forms
of
powerlessness
often
limit
the
possibility
of
using
one’s
conscience
.


For
this
reason
,
we
also
strive
to
dismantle
the
structures
of
injustice
that
force
people
into
situations
in
which
they
have
few
,
if
any
,
choices
.

Questions
about
Conscience

We
'
ve
compiled
these
talking
points
to
help
inform
Catholic
conversations
about
conscience
.



What
is
a
conscience
?



Our
conscience
is
our
capacity
to
judge
right
from
wrong
and
good
from
evil
.


It
is
an
internal
moral
compass
that
seeks
truth
and
wisdom
to
guide
own
behavior
and
decisions
.


One’s
conscience
draws
upon
moral
codes
that
come
from
religion
and
society
,
as
well
as
one’s
internal
belief
systems
and
personal
values
.



What
factors
inform
your
conscience
?



Many
factors
form
one’s
conscience
.


They
include
the
wisdom
of
one’s
religious
tradition
,
of
course
.


But
a
well-formed
conscience
also
incorporates
knowledge
from
other
sources
,
such
as
science
,
medicine
,
ethical
frameworks
and
our
own
experience
.



Are
there
limits
on
the
ways
in
which
we
can
use
our
conscience
?



One’s
individual
conscience
should
always
be
the
ultimate
authority
in
all
moral
decision-making
.


However
,
sinful
structures
of
gender
inequality
,
systemic
racism
,
economic
insecurity
and
immigration
status
can
limit
one’s
ability
to
make
choices
.


The
ability
to
use
one’s
conscience
and
make
choices
is
too
often
a
luxury
enjoyed
by
those
who
are
wealthy
,
white
and
privileged
.


As
Catholics
committed
to
a
rich
tradition
of
social
justice
teachings
,
we
must
dismantle
the
injustices
that
prevent
people
from
being
able
to
exercise
their
consciences
and
make
choices
for
themselves
.

choices

[Everyone
Has

Purpose
,
Few
Have
a
Conscience]

Purpose
is
the
raison
d’être
of
a
company
,
the
permanent

strategy
.


Every
company
has
a
purpose
,
explicit
or
not
;
however
,
few
–
although
this
is

–
have

.


To
be
clear
,
the
Mafia

a
purpose
,
but
consciousness
is
just
another
story
.

By
this
,
what
I
mean
is
that
everyone
has

purpose

even

Mafia

yet

fewer
are

way
they
define
it

---------------

It
is
good
business
to
be
true
to
what
the
company
is
,
allowing
the
public
to
recognize
how
it
behaves
with
a
conscience
.


Although
,
in
addition
,
society
demands
a
positive
social
and
environmental
impact
from
the

What
Is

[What
Is
Freedom
of
Conscience
,
and
Why
Does
It
Matter
?

]

What
is
“conscience”
?


It’s
a
word
we’re
all
familiar
with—a
clear
conscience
,
a
guilty
conscience—even
if
we
can’t
pinpoint
an
exact
definition
.



The
concept
pops
up
in
all
kinds
of
places
.


In
Saturday
morning
cartoons
where
good
guys
consult
an
angel
on
their
right
shoulder
(conscience)
and
a
devil
on
their
left
shoulder
(temptation)
before
making
a
decision
.


In
literary
masterpieces
like
Crime
and
Punishment
,
where
the
---------------
final
good
act
after
a
lifetime
of
evil
.



But
none
of
these
examples
capture
the
full
concept
of
conscience
.


As
Americans
,
we
should
consider
the
true
meaning
of
“conscience
.

”
We
should
also
recognize
the
importance—and
privilege—of
having
the
freedom
of
conscience
.


America
was
founded
on
this
freedom
.


And
it’s
worth
preserving
today
.



Read
on
to
find
out
why
.



What
is
freedom
of
conscience
?



Conscience
is
our
God-given
ability
to
discern
right
from
wrong
,
good
from
evil
.


But
it’s
more
than
that
.


For
knowing
right
from
wrong
wouldn’t
do
much
good
if
we
didn’t
(or
couldn’t)
act
on
what’s
right
.


So
conscience
also
includes
the
ability
to
apply
laws
,
rules
,
and
intuitions
in
the
right
way
.


In
other
words
,
to
act
on
what
we
believe
.



---------------
action
by
serving
others
.



Where
is
freedom
of
conscience
found
in
the
Constitution
?



America’s
Founders
understood
the
gravity
of
protecting
the
freedom
of
conscience
.



James
Madison
called
conscience
“the
most
sacred
of
all
property
.

”
Thomas
Jefferson
said
that
no
“provision
in
our
constitution
ought
to
be
dearer
to
man
,
than
that
which
protects
the
rights
of
conscience
against”
the
government
.


And
during
the
debate
over
what
would
become
the
First
Amendment
,
many
lawmakers
proposed
protecting
the
rights
of
conscience
.



This
understanding
shaped
the
First
Amendment
.


Although
the
amendment
doesn’t
explicitly
mention
“conscience
,”
it
protects
its
animating
features
:
religious
freedom
and
free
speech
.


The
First
Amendment
says
,
“Congress
shall
make
no
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion
,
or
---------------
speech
,
or
of
the
press
.

”

Why
is
freedom
of
conscience
important
?



These
26
words
protect
the
freedom
of
conscience—the
freedom
to
believe
without
coercion
and
to
speak
and
act
consistently
with
those
beliefs
.



---------------
things
to
which
we
object
.


So
we
have
the
freedom
to
think
,
reason
,
speak
,
stay
silent
about
,
and
hold
certain
beliefs
without
fearing
government
punishment
.


That
protects
our
private
conscience
.



But
our
internal
beliefs
often
move
us
to
act
publicly
.


So
the
First
---------------

The
freedom
to
act
on
our
beliefs
is
important
because
community
standards—or
lack
thereof—reflect
individuals’
conscience
.


The
more
we
train
our
conscience
to
do
what
is
right
,
the
better
off
we
will
be
.


But
we
lose
our
ability
to
discern
right
from
wrong
the
more
we
consistently
ignore
our
conscience
.



The
freedom
of
conscience
has
also
benefitted
America’s
common
good
.


Because
of
this
freedom
,
religious
organizations
have
founded
and
currently
operate

,

shelters
,

What
are
some
court
cases
dealing
with
freedom
of
conscience
?



The
freedom
of
conscience
is
worth
preserving
.


Several
court
cases
seek
to
do
(and
have
done)
just
that
.


Consider
three
contexts
:

The
freedom
of

to
decline
to
provide

procedures
that
violate
their
conscience
.

.

freedom
of
faith-based
public-service
ministries
to
operate
in
line
with
their
religious
purpose
.



Freedom
of
conscience
for

For
almost
eighty
years
,

Supreme
Court
has
recognized
that
---------------
its
laws
to
force
her
to
create
websites
promoting
messages
that
contradict
her
beliefs
about
marriage
.


Unwilling
to
violate
the
law
or
her
conscience
,
Lorie
challenged
the
law
to
protect
the
cherished
freedom
to
speak
consistently
with
her
religious
views
on
marriage
.

 

---------------
consistent
with
his
belief
about
the
immutability
of
sex
.


Lorie’s
victory
reaffirms
that
the
Supreme
Court
still
believes
in
the
importance
of
a
free
conscience
.


That’s
how
it
should
be
.


Every
American
has
the
right
to
speak
freely
.


That’s
why
Lorie
found
support
from
a
diverse
group
of
artists—from
a
world-renowned
graphic
designer
to
a
---------------
artist
who
hold
different
views
about
marriage
.



Freedom
of
conscience
for
health-care
professionals

Beyond
speech
,
the
freedom
of
conscience
is
imperative
in
the
medical
field
.


Since
ancient
times
,
physicians
have
sworn
to
“do
no
harm”
to
their
patients
.


Fast
forward
to
present
day
,
and
professional
medical
ethics
acknowledge
the
rights
of
professionals
to
decline
to
provide
medical
treatment
that
violates
their
conscience
.



The
justification
echoes
the
First
Amendment—to
preserve
the
personal
---------------
the
case
must
proceed
.



Freedom
of
conscience
for
faith-based
ministries

The
freedom
of
conscience
allows
faith-based
ministries
to
provide
other
public
services
to
care
for
the
most
vulnerable
among
us
.


For
example
,
ADF
has
twice
defended
Downtown

nonprofit
---------------
These
ministries
provide
critical
services
to
their
communities
.


And
they
do
so
because
of
their
religious
beliefs
.


This
is
a
common
feature
of
American
history
made
possible
by
the
freedom
of
conscience
.


In
that
way
,
protecting
the
ability
of
these
ministries
to
live
out
their
faith
ensures
that
other
religious
organizations
can
do
the
same
while

Conclusion

By
now
,
we’ve
answered
the
original
question—what
is
conscience
?


And
we’ve
answered
another—
why
is
freedom
of

worth
preserving
?



In

,
this

dignity

[edit]

The

How
SB
1580
Defines
‘Right
of
Medical
Conscience’
and
Free
Speech
in
Health
Care
By
Jeff
Scott
,
Esq
.


,
FMA
General
Counsel

---------------

It
is
the
intent
of
the
Legislature
to
provide
the
right
of
medical
conscience
for
health
care
providers
and
payors
to
ensure
they
can
care
for
patients
in
a
manner
consistent
with
their
moral
,
ethical
,
and
religious
convictions
.


Further
,
it
is
the
intent
of
the
Legislature
that
licensed
health
care
providers
and
payors
be
free
from
threat
of
discrimination
for
providing
conscience-based
health
care
.



This
Legislature
coupled
this
“right
of
medical
conscience”
with
a
provision
protecting
the
“use
of
free
speech
by
a
health
care
practitioner”
to
create
a
comprehensive
legislative
package
that
was
a
priority
of
Gov
.


Ron
DeSantis
.


This
analysis
of
SB
1580
will
attempt
to
explain
how
these
two
new
provisions
affect
the
practice
of
medicine
.


Right
of
Medical
Conscience
SB
1580
creates
a
new
section
of
the
Florida
Statutes¹
that
gives
health
care
providers
(and
health
care
payors)
the
right
to
“opt
out
of
participation
in
or
payment
for
any
health
care
service
on
the
basis
of
a
conscience-based
objection
.

”
It
is
important
to
note
that
this
right
of
conscience
only
applies
to
a
“health
care
service
.

”
It
does
not
give
a
health
care
provider
the
right
to
refuse
to
perform
job
requirements
that
do
not
involve
the
provision
---------------
performed
or
provided
by
any
health
care
provider
.



If
a
health
care
provider
has
a
conscience-based
objection
to
performing
abortions
,
the
provider
may
not
be
discriminated
against
or
suffer
adverse
action
for
refusing
to
perform
abortions
.


However
,
a
provider

patients
based
on
the
patient’s
race
,
color
,
religion
,
sex
,
or
national
origin
.


The
right
of
conscience
is
solely
attached
to
a
specific
health
care
service
.


A
provider
can
refuse
to
prescribe
contraceptives
to
his/her
patients
but
cannot
refuse
to
prescribe
contraceptives
to
only
Medicaid
---------------
procedure
to
his/her
patients
may
not
refuse
to
provide
that
procedure
to
a
subset
of
patients
who
engage
in
a
certain
type
of
behavior
,
even
if
the
provider
has
a
conscience-based
objection
to
that
behavior
.


While
the
bill
sponsors
made
it
clear
as
to
what
the
right
of
conscience
applies
to
,
they
left
the
issue
of
whether
a
conscientious
objection
exists
less
certain
.


SB
1580
defines
a
“conscience-based
objection”
as
an
objection
based
on
a
sincerely
held
religious
,
moral
,
or
ethical
belief
.

²
As
noted
in
the
footnote
,
whether
an
entity
such
as
an
insurance
company
has
a
conscience
is
determined
by
existing
written
evidence
.


If
the
articles
of
incorporation
for
an
insurer
state
that
the
company
exists
to
provide
health
insurance
for
individuals

requirement)

If
the
company
cannot
produce
a
governing
document
,
published
guideline
,
or
set
of
policies
or
regulations
,
it
will
not
be
entitled
to
assert
a
right
of
conscience
.


Individual
health
care
providers³
,
on
the
other
hand
,
do
not
have
to
produce
written
evidence
attesting
to
a
sincerely
held

,

---------------
General
,
as
the
entity
given
enforcement
authority
for
this
statute
,
to
determine
whether
a
health
care
provider
alleging
a
violation
has
a
valid
conscience-based
objection
.


Presumably
,
the
Attorney
General
will
assess
a
provider’s
self-professed
belief
on
a
case-by-case
basis
in
a
manner
congruent
with
the
inquiry
used
for
similar
laws
,
such
as

for

beliefs)
.


Health
care
providers
and
payors
who
wish
to
opt
out
of
participation
in
or
payment
for
a
health
care
service
due
to
a
conscience-based
objection
must
do
the
following
:

---------------

patient’s
medical
file
.


-
Notify
patients
seeking
an
appointment
for
a
health
care
service

that
the
provider
has
a
conscience-based
objection
to
of
that

objection
before
scheduling
the
appointment
.


-
Providers
who
are
students
must
provide
written
notice
of
their

conscience-based
objection
to
the
educational
institution
at
the

time
the
objection
is
made
or
as
soon
as
practicable
.



Providers
who
comply
with
these
requirements
may
not
be
discriminated
against⁴
or
suffer
adverse
action⁵
for
exercising
their
right
of
medical
conscience
.


The
right
of
medical
conscience
section
also
includes
speech
and
whistle-blower
protections
,
which
prohibit
discriminating
or
taking
adverse
action
against
health
care
providers
or
payors
who
report
violations
of
the
new
right
of
medical
conscience
statute
.


This
protection
is
extended
to
providers
who
testify
,
assist
or
participate
in
a
proceeding
brought
by
the
Attorney
General
to
determine
if

---------------
Interestingly
,
this
part
of
the
new
law
also
includes
a
prohibition
on
discriminating
against
a
health
care
provider
or
payor
for
reasons
not
related
to
the
right
of
medical
conscience
.


Protection
from
discrimination
is
extended
to
the
disclosure
of
information
the
provider
or
payor
reasonably
believes
constitutes
:
---------------
Under
the
original
House
companion
to
SB
1580
,
health
care
providers
and
payors
were
given
a
civil
cause
of
action
for
any
violation
of
the
right
of
conscience
section
.


SB
1580
,
however
,
rejected
this
approach
in
favor
of
allowing
the
Attorney
General
to
investigate
complaints
and
bring
a
civil
action
for
damages
,
injunctive
or
other
appropriate
relief
,
and
attorney
fees
.


Health
care
providers
and
payors
who
decline
to
participate
in
or
pay
for
a
health
care
service
because
of
a
conscience-based
objection
may
not
be
held
civilly
liable
on
that
basis
alone
.


Finally
,
acknowledging
the
existence
of
federal
EMTALA
requirements
,
the
Legislature
specifically
stated
that
the
medical
conscience
section
does
not
override
any
state
or
federal
requirement
to
provide
emergency
medical
treatment
.

Freedom

The

Freedom
of

Freedom
of
conscience
is
one
of
the
fundamental
freedoms
protected
by
section
2
of
the Canadian
Charter
of
Rights
and
Freedoms
.

[1]

What
is
the
legal
impact
of
this
freedom
?



Ultimately
,
the
freedom
of
conscience
constitutionally
recognizes
“the
centrality
of
individual
conscience
and
the
inappropriateness
of
governmental
intervention
…
to
constrain
its
manifestation
.

”[2] In
fact
,
the
Supreme
Court
has
ruled
that
“an
emphasis
on
individual
conscience
and
individual
judgment
…
lies
at
the
heart
of
our
democratic
political
tradition
.


The
ability
of
each
citizen
to
make
free
and
informed
---------------
What
is
legally
protected
from
government
interference
?



The
only
Supreme
Court
case
considering
the
freedom
of
conscience
directly
is R
v
Morgentaler
.

[4]
This
1988
case
dealt
with
the
constitutionality
of
abortion
laws
.


Justice
Wilson
stated
:
“[t]he
decision
whether
or
not
to
terminate
a
pregnancy
is
essentially
a
moral
decision
and
…
the
conscience
of
the
individual
must
be
paramount
.

”[5] She
also
held
that
the
freedoms
guaranteed
by
section
2(a)
“should
be
broadly
construed
to
extend
to
conscientiously-held
---------------

Without
guidance
from
the
Supreme
Court
,
lower
courts
have
had
to
figure
out
on
their
own
what
the
freedom
of
conscience
protects
.


From
the
limited
jurisprudence
that
exists
,
we
know
“[t]he
guarantee
of
freedom
of

system
.

”[7] If
a
person’s
actions
are
not
motivated
by
a
“comprehensive
value
system”
(in
a
secular
context)
,
 then
they
are
not
protected
by
section
2(a)
.

[8] This
can
be
quite
limiting
:
when
people
have
argued
that
their
freedom
of
conscience
was
violated
by
mandatory
seatbelt
laws
for
example
,
their
arguments
failed
because
their
objections
were
not
supported
by
a
comprehensive
value
system
.



‘Insubstantial’
infringements
upon
a
person’s
conscience
are
also
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
guarantee
.

[9] This
is
a
limitation
that
all
the
fundamental
freedoms
share
:
the freedom
of
religion for
instance
---------------

One
of
the
few
lower
court
decisions
solely
considering
the
freedom
of
conscience
,
rather
than
conscience
and
religion
together
,
was Maurice
v
Canada
(Attorney
General)
.

[11]
Mr
.


Maurice
wanted
to
receive
vegetarian
meals
in
prison
.


Originally
,
he
was
provided
with
these
meals
in
---------------
successfully
claimed
that
,
since
he
remained
vegetarian
for
conscientious
reasons
,
this
was
a
violation
of
his
freedom
of
conscience
.

[12] The
Federal
Court
agreed
,
declaring
that
the
“Charter …
entitle[s]
the
Applicant
to
a
vegetarian
diet
.

”[13]

The
freedom
of
conscience
garnered
some
attention
in
2015
when
the
Supreme
Court
decided Carter
v
Canada
(Attorney
General)
.


In
that
case
,
a
number
of
interveners
claimed
that
providing
access
to
physician-assisted
dying
would
infringe
the
freedom
of
conscience
of
medical
professionals
.

[14] This
argument
went
beyond
the
scope
of
what
needed
to
be
decided
in
that
case
.


However
the
Court
noted
that
physician-assisted
dying
was
indeed
a
“matter
of
conscience”
and
that
at
some
point
“the Charter
rights
of
patients
and
physicians
will
need
to
be
reconciled
.

”[15]

What
are
the
limitations
on
the
freedom
of
conscience
?



While
the
freedom
of
conscience
is
a
fundamental
freedom
,
it
is
not
absolute
.


As
with
all
other
rights
and
freedoms
in

,
if
a
breach
of
this
freedom
is
found
by
a
court

The
Modern
Misunderstanding
of
Conscience

The
Catholic
Church
teaches
that
the
conscience
is
a
natural
facility
of
our
reason
that
directs
us
to
do
good
and
avoid
evil
;
that
makes
judgments
about
the
good
and
evil
of
particular
acts
;
and
that
bears
witness
after
the
fact
to
the
good
or
evil
that
we
have
done
,
such
as
what
we
call
“having
a
guilty
conscience
.

”¹

A
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
the
role
of
the
human
conscience
lies
at
the
root
of
many
of
the
problems
in
the
Catholic
Church
today
.


Very
few
Catholics
even
know
what
that
role
actually
is
.


When
pressed
,
many
will
say
something
along
the
lines
of
“If
my
conscience
tells
me
that
a
particular
action
is
all
right
,
I
can
do
it
.

”

This
is
just
another
way
of
saying
“If
it
feels
good
,
do
it
.

”
If
an
improperly-formed
conscience
leads
a
person
to
accept
something
as
right
and
good
based
simply
on
his
or
her
uninformed
opinions
and
feelings
,
that
person
will
fall
into
grave
errors
for
which
there
is
no
good
---------------

they
are
a
law
to
themselves
,
even
though
they
do
not
have
the
law
.



They
show
that
what
the
law
requires
is
written
on
their
hearts
,
while

their
conscience
also
bears
witness
and
their
conflicting
thoughts

accuse
or
perhaps
excuse
them
on
that
day
when
,
according
to
my

gospel
,
God
judges
the
secrets
of
men
by
Christ
Jesus
.


(Romans

2
:14-15)

Many
Catholics
erroneously
believe
that
the
conscience
is
a
teacher
,
not
a
pupil
;
that
it
is
the
source
of
morality
.


This
is
not
the
teaching
of
the
Catholic
Church
.


According
to
the
Church
,
the
conscience
is
a
witness
to
the
moral
law
authored
by
God
.


Each
Catholic
is
required
to
obey
that
moral
law
in
all
things
.


The
conscience
,
if
properly
formed
,
calls
him
to
obey
that
moral
law
and
helps
him
to
understand
how
to
apply
it
in
particular
cases
.


---------------
Result
:
A
Deformed
Belief
System

The
belief
that
the
conscience
is
a
moral
authority
in
its
own
right
has
resulted
in
Catholics
supporting
and
promoting
many
intrinsic
evils
,
including
contraception
,
sterilization
,
abortion
,
homosexual
activity
,
---------------

Many
organizations
vigorously
promote
this
false
understanding
of
the
human
conscience
in
order
to
gain
more
support
from
Catholic
laity
.


One
of
these
groups
is
“Catholics”
for
Choice
(CFC)
,
whose
mission
consists
of
attempting
to
convince
people
that
they
can
be
pro-abortion
and
still
be
“good
Catholics
.

”
In
its
quarterly
magazine
,
ironically
entitled
Conscience
,
CFC
attempts
to
legitimize
the
obvious
paradox
that
“Church
law
affirms
both
the
right
and
the
responsibility
of
a
Catholic
to
follow
his
or
her
conscience
,
even
when
it
conflicts
with
church
teaching”²
(emphasis
added)
.



CFC
also
alleges
:


The
Catholic
Church
officially
teaches
that
the
conscience
of
an

individual
is
supreme
.


If
you
carefully
examine
your
conscience
and

then
decide
that
an
abortion
is
the
most
moral
act
you
can
do
at
this

time
,
you
are
not
committing
a
sin
.


Therefore
,
you
are
not
---------------
It
is
easy
to
demonstrate
that
CFC
does
not
really
believe
this
principle
itself
.


For
example
,
would
it
concede
that
it
was
legitimate
for
someone
to
“carefully
examine
their
conscience”
and
then
decide
that
torching
an
abortion
clinic
in
the
middle
of
the
night
was
“the
most
moral
act
they
could
do
at
this
time
?

”
---------------
gay-straight
alliance
whose
purpose
is
to
disseminate
homophile
propaganda
in
the
schools
is
“the
embodiment
of
a
perfectly-formed
Catholic
conscience
.

”
She
dismissed
her
critics
,
who
quoted
actual
Church
teachings
on
homosexuality
,
as
“archaic
.

”⁴

---------------
Personal
Judgement
vs
.


Objective
Standards

How
does
conscience
relate
to
morality
?



In
order
for
a
person’s
conscience
to
be
conditioned
to
accept
evil
,
it
must
first
decisively
turn
away
from
God’s
teachings
and
decide
that
it
can
determine
for
itself
what
is
right
and
wrong
,
ignoring
all
external
---------------
This
means
that
dissenters
must
justify
their
claims
by
assuming
that
there
is
no
fixed
morality
that
is
binding
on
all
persons
.


The
only
source
of
morality
is
the
conscience
of
each
individual
.


One
phrase
that
is
coming
into
common
usage
among
the
self-appointed
elite
is
“This
is
my
truth
.

”
---------------
would
permit
.



[natural

moral
principles
to

,
which
then

,

---------------
It
is
one
thing
for
a
person
to
say
“I
disagree
with
the
Church’s
teaching
on
abortion
.

”
It
is
another
thing
entirely
to
say
“The
Church
teaches
that
abortion
is
permissible
,
so
long
as
my
conscience
allows
it
.

”
This
statement
is
false
,
and
can
only
be
uttered
by
one
who
is
grossly
ignorant
of
Church
teaching
or
who
deliberately
lies
about
such
---------------

A
person
is
culpable
for
the
evil
he
commits
when
he
“takes
little
trouble
to
find
out
what
is
true
and
good
,
or
when
conscience
is
by
degrees
almost
blinded
through
the
habit
of
committing
sin
.

”⁵

---------------
 

The
Formation
of
the
Conscience

The
conscience
is
a
precious
gift
and
it
must
be
cared
for
by
forming
it
with
prayer
and
education
for
the
duration
of
our
lives
.



The
Catechism
states
,
“The
education
of
conscience
is
indispensable
for
human
beings
who
are
subjected
to
negative
influences
and
tempted
by
sin
to
prefer
their
own
judgment
and
to
reject
authoritative
teachings”
(¶1783)
.



A
dead
giveaway
that
a
person’s
conscience
is
improperly
formed
is
when
he
or
she
says
something
like
“I
respect
the
teachings
of
the
Church
,
but
I
follow
my
own
conscience
in
matters
of
sexual
morality
.

”
Nancy
Pelosi
gave
us
a
typical
example
of
this
deception
when
she
claimed
that
she
was
a
“practicing
and
respectful
Catholic”
but
,
regarding
the
---------------
position
is
.

”⁶

This
means
that
the
person’s
conscience
has
become
disconnected
from
the
truth
.


This
has
several
root
causes
(Catechism
,
¶1792)
:

---------------
-
Bad
example
given
by
others
,
-
Enslavement
to
one’s
passions
,
-
Assertion
of
a
mistaken
notion
of
autonomy
of
conscience
,
-
Rejection
of
the
Church’s
authority
and
her
teaching
,
-
Lack
of
conversion
and
of
charity
.

”

By
contrast
,
a
properly‑formed
Catholic
conscience
has
been
rigorously
educated
,
is
fully
aware
of
the
intrinsically
evil
nature
of
abortion
and
other
evils
,
and
is
led
by
this
knowledge
to
vigorously
oppose
them
.


---------------
Failure
to
act
is
not
a
viable
option
.



It
is
true
that
Catholics
must
follow
their
consciences
,
but
their
consciences
must
be
formed
by
the
Word
of
God
,
which
is
authentically
interpreted
and
taught
by
the
Magisterium
of
the
Catholic
Church
,
to
which
Christ
entrusted
His
authority
to
teach
in
His
Name
.


The
conscience
must
be
continuously
schooled
to
recognize
,
not
to
determine
,
what
is
and
is
not
moral
activity
.



As
the
Catechism
teaches
,
“Objective
rules
of
morality
express
the
rational
order
of
good
and
evil
,
attested
to
by
conscience
.

…
It
is
by
the
judgment
of
conscience
that
man
perceives
and
recognizes
the
prescriptions
of
the
divine
law”
(¶1751
,
1778)
.

Conscience
and
Vatican
II

Some
appeal
to
an
ill‑defined
“Spirit
of
Vatican
II”
to
support
their
concept
of
the
human
conscience
.


They
use
vague
terms
such
as
“renewal
,”
“reinvigoration”
and
“rejuvenation”
of
the
Church
,
while
consciously
misrepresenting
what
the
documents
of
the
Council
actually
say
.


They
often
quote
the
Vatican
II
document
Dignitatis
Humanae
(“Declaration
on
Religious
Freedom”)
in
support
of
their
contention
that
people
should
be
able
to
do
anything
their
uneducated
consciences
do
not
object
to
.

⁷

However
,
this
is
obviously
not
what
the
Fathers
of
Vatican
II
taught
.


They
instead
laid
out
very
clearly
the
multiple
dangers
inherent
in
this
line
of
thinking
.


In
Gaudium
et
Spes
,
they
wrote
,
“Conscience
frequently
errs
from
invincible
ignorance
without
losing
its
dignity
.


The
same
cannot
be
said
for
a
man
who
cares
but
little
for
truth
and
goodness
,
or
for
a
conscience
which
by
degrees
grows
practically
sightless
as
a
result
of
habitual
sin”
(¶16‑17)
.


Furthermore
,
the
document
notes
that
“not
a
few
can
be
found
who
seem
inclined
to
use
the
name
of
freedom
as
---------------

The
document
continues
by
confirming
an
essential
principle
:
That
the
conscience
must
submit
itself
to
the
authority
of
the
Church
:


In
forming
their
consciences
,
the
Christian
faithful
must
give
careful

attention
to
the
sacred
and
certain
teaching
of
the
Church
.


For
the

Catholic
Church
is
by
the
will
of
Christ
the
teacher
of
truth
.


Her
---------------

itself
.


(¶14)

Conscience
does
have
a
very
particular
and
necessary
role
given
by
God
.


As
defined
in
Romans
2
:12‑16
and
Jeremiah
31
:33
,
God
imprints
the
natural
law
on
the
heart
and
soul
of
man
,
and
this
leads
him
to
know
whether
or
not
an
act
is
moral
or
evil
.

⁹
This
means
that
the
“natural
law”
is
man’s
instinctual
knowledge
of
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
―
his
“conscience
.

”
However
,
the
conscience
must
work
with
the
teachings
of
the
Church
,
never
against
it
.



---------------

The
Church
,
as
demonstrated
in
a
particularly
vivid
manner
by
Her
martyrs
,
has
always
held
that
a
person’s
properly-formed
conscience
may
never
be
violated
.


Countless
men
,
women
and
even
children
have
courageously
stated
,
“You
may
kill
me
,
but
you
will
never
force
me
to
violate
my
conscience
.

”

This
principle
has
more
recently
been
recognized
by
secular
authorities
.


---------------
Rights
and
its
1966
International
Covenant
on
Civil
and
Political
Rights
,
states
that
“everyone
has
the
right
to
freedom
of
thought
,
conscience
and
religion
.

”

When
society
fails
to
acknowledge
conscience
as
a
human
right
and
does
not
provide
protections
for
individuals
to
follow
their
own
consciences
,
grave
conflicts
inevitably
result
.


Either
people
will
heroically
obey
their
consciences
whatever
the
cost
,
or
they
will
lose
their
moral
integrity
with
all
the
devastating
effects
that
flow
from
this
on
society
at
large
.


---------------

Tragically
,
many
Catholics
possess
a
fatally
flawed
concept
of
conscience
,
denying
the
need
for
formation
in
the
truth
,
and
treating
mere
desire
as
an
absolute
.


Conscience
is
indeed
a
decision-maker
,
but
it
must
be
freely
submitted
to
the
law
of
God
,
to
which
it
is
a
witness
,
not
an
arbiter
.



The
error
lies
not
in
affirming
the
freedom
of
conscience
to
decide
,
but
in
misinterpreting
the
nature
of
such
freedom
.


Freedom
of
conscience
must
be
at
the
service
of
moral
truth
but
can
never
be
its
determinant
.

The

on
“freedom

”
Nowhere
does
this
phrase
occur
.



And
the

nowhere
lends
its
authority
to
the
theory
for

which
the

that

The
Bible
contains
many
references
to
the
human
conscience
.


It
describes
the
fate
of
someone
who
does
not
guard
or
“keep”
his
conscience
(Hebrews
9
:14
and
1
Peter
3
:16)
,
and
who
allows
his
conscience
to
become
“seared”
(1
Timothy
4
:2)
.


The
Bible
also
speaks
of
a
“weak
conscience”
(1
Corinthians
8
:7)
,
a
“wounded
conscience”
(1
Corinthians
8
:12)
,
a
“good”
and
“perfect”
conscience
(Hebrews
9
:9
and
13
:18
;
1
Peter
3
:21
;
and
1
Timothy
1
:5
,19)
;
a
“clear”
or
blameless
conscience
(Acts
24
:16
and
1
Timothy
3
:9)
,
and
a
conscience
that
is
“evil”
or
defiled
(Titus
1
:15)
.

Examining
the
Role
of
Conscience
in
Making
Moral
Decisions

 [Examining
the
Role
of
Conscience
in
Making
Moral
Decisions]

[]
---------------
[]

Q
:
I
disagree
with
some
of
the
teachings
of
the
Catholic
Church
.


I
was
once
told
that
I
don’t
have
to
follow
all
of
the
church’s
teachings
if
they
violate
my
conscience
.


But
still
,
I’m
not
sure
that’s
right
.



A
:
First
,
I
want
to
commend
you
for
asking
this
question
.


The
fact
that
---------------
asked
someone
who
ought
to
be
able
to
give
some
guidance
on
what
was
a
difficult
moral
question
.


In
response
,
they
seemed
to
get
an
answer
that
indicated
that
,
in
the
end
,
they
had
to
just
“follow
their
conscience
.

”

I
can
understand
this
.


In
the
course
of
my
life
as
a
priest
,
I
have
---------------
right
decision-making
,
the
right
way
to
go
remained
foggy
and
difficult
.




“When
he
listens
to
his
conscience
,
the
prudent
man
can
hear
God

speaking”
—CCC
1777

In
addition
,
the
Catechism
of
the
Catholic
Church
teaches
:
“When
he
listens
to
his
conscience
,
the
prudent
man
can
hear
God
speaking”
(CCC
1777)
.


Because
of
this
line
and
others
that
highlight
the
importance
of
conscience
,
it
is
tempting
to
take
the
default
position
of
“whatever
you
feel
is
right
,
just
do
that
.

”

---------------
true
.



Second
,
the
church’s
teaching
on
conscience
presumes
knowledge
of
the
moral
law
.


This
means
that
those
who
are
exercising
conscience
know
that
there
is
a
real
right
and
a
real
wrong
.


Unfortunately
,
there
are
fewer
people
who
acknowledge
this
reality
.


This
places
us
in
a
unique
place
in
---------------
a
nationwide
study
on
the
moral
life
of
18-
to
29-year-olds
.


His
conclusion
was
that
this
age
group
,
generally
speaking
,
has
neither
the
vocabulary
nor
the
categories
to
make
moral
decisions
.


If
conscience
depends
on
principles
of
right
and
wrong
,
how
will
these
young
people
make
decisions
?


According
to
Smith
,
they
base
their
decisions
on
feelings
.



But
conscience
is
not
a
feeling
.


The
catechism
clearly
states
that
conscience
“formulates
its
judgments
according
to
reason
,
in
conformity
with
the
true
good
willed
by
the
wisdom
of
the
Creator”
(CCC
1783)
.


This
means
employing
one’s
mind
more
than
one’s
emotions
to
make
decisions
.


Conscience
is
not
merely
some
feeling
we
get
;
it
is
the
critical
application
of
truth
to
the
present
issue
.



Third
,
it
is
true
that
,
a
person
“must
not
be
forced
to
act
contrary
to
his
conscience
.


Nor
must
he
be
prevented
from
acting
according
to
his
conscience
,
especially
in
religious
matters”
(CCC
1782)
.


But
this
does
not
mean
doing
whatever
pleases
me
.



---------------
the
church’s
constant
teaching
against
artificial
birth
control
in
the
document
“Humanae
Vitae
,”
many
couples
were
encouraged
to
dismiss
this
teaching
if
it
“violated
their
conscience
.

”
Unfortunately
,
as
a
result
,
many
couples
were
obliquely
encouraged
to
invite
a
sinful
practice
into
their
sexual
relationship
.


Even
more
,
they
were
led
to
believe
that
they
---------------

Because
that
is
all
this
comes
down
to
.


The
church’s
teaching
on
contraception
does
not
“violate”
a
person’s
conscience
.


Unless
a
person
truly
believed
that
periodic
abstinence
in
marriage
was
an
evil
(which
is
all
that
is
being
asked
for
through
natural
family
planning)
,
then
there
is
no
conscience
issue
here
.


It
is
an
issue
of
a)
not
knowing
or
understanding
the
church’s
teaching
(which
could
be
remedied
by
asking
someone
who
knows)
,
b)
lacking
the
will
to
choose
the
good
(which
is
---------------
After
all
of
this
,
if
we
still
have
reasonable
doubt
regarding
what
to
do
,
we
ought
to
do
the
following
.


First
,
pray
.


Second
,
it
is
wise
to
examine
your
conscience
regularly
.


Third
,
choose
to
do
good
.


Fourth
,
seek
wise
and
holy
counsel
from
someone
who
is
not
only
educated
in
the
area
of
morality
but
who
personally
defers
to
the
wisdom
of
Christ
and
---------------
all
else
.


Even
in
very
difficult
circumstances
,
God
can
be
trusted
.

What
is
Freedom
of
Conscience
?




Whether
they’re
happening
inside
the
Church
or
out
in
the
public
square
,
debates
about
how
far
freedom
of
conscience
extends
can
be
confusing
.


Should
Christians
be
compelled
to
take
a
vaccine
that’s
been
tested
on
the
fetal
remains
of
an
aborted
child
?


Should
Christian
business
owners
have
a
right
to
refuse
a
service
that
would
violate
their
conscience
,
like
baking
a
wedding
cake
for
a
same-sex
ceremony
?


How
do
Christians
respond
to
government
mandates
or
policies
that
they
cannot
follow
in
good
conscience
?


And
how
do
we
deal
with
conscientious
disagreement
within
the
Church
?



The
specifics
of
freedom
of
conscience
can
be
complex
and
nuanced
and
are
often
misunderstood
.


Abraham
Kuyper
called
the
conscience
:

“the
shield
of
the
human
person
,
the
root
of
civil
liberties
,
the
source
---------------

Why
is
it
so
important
?


To
answer
that
question
,
let’s
begin
by
looking
at
what
the
conscience
is
and
is
not
.



What
is
“conscience”
?



Definitions
of
conscience
vary
,
but
they
center
around
the
idea
of
what
someone
believes
to
be
right
and
wrong
.


The
conscience
is
a
moral
compass
that
helps
direct
people’s
actions
.


In
that
sense
,
conscience
is
personal
and
subjective
because
it
condemns
or
excuses
one’s
own
conduct
,
not
that
of
another
person
–
after
all
,
you
don’t
get
a
guilty
conscience
because
of
someone
else’s
behavior
.



However
,
conscience
is
also
based
on
an
objective
and
general
standard
.


The
Bible
explains
that
the
conscience
is
given
by
God
to
both
Christians
and
non-Christians
and
it
helps
people
apply
their
knowledge
of
right
and
wrong
to
their
behavior
,
both
past
actions
and
decisions
about
future
actions
.


The
New
Testament
also
speaks
of
the
importance
of
having
a
good
conscience
by
following
its
direction
and
doing
what
is
right
(see
Rom
.


2
:15
,
1
Tim
.


1
:5)
.



[]Christian
political
scientist
David
Koyzis
,
in
his
book
We
Answer
to
Another
,
tells
a
story
about
the
Milgram
Experiment
which
relates
well
to
conscience
.


The
experiment
was
a
study
designed
to
look
at
how
people
respond
to
authority
.


The
experimenter
would
select
two
participants
and
assign
one
the
role
of
teacher
,
while
another
volunteer
would
be
given
---------------
and
answerable
to
a
higher
authority
.



Ultimately
,
the
foundation
for
freedom
of
conscience
is
found
in
the
sovereignty
of
God
.


Every
human
being
has
various
authorities
in
their
lives
,
such
as
parents
,
employers
,
church
leadership
,
or
civil
government
.


Each
of
these
has
legitimate
authority
over
us
,
but
that
authority
is
also
limited
.


The
only
One
who
is
sovereign
over
the
conscience
is
God
,
and
if
another
authority
commands
us
to
do
what
we
believe
is
sin
–
what
we
believe
violates
how
God
wants
us
to
act
–
then
we
can
appeal
to
freedom
of
conscience
.


The
conscience
is
a
shield
that
protects
against
the
abuse
of
authority
and
points
instead
to
the
one
Higher
Authority
.



Conscience
and
the
public
square

Debates
around
conscience
are
becoming
increasingly
relevant
in
our
society
and
are
most
noticeable
within
certain
vocations
.


Can
medical
professionals
refuse
to
help
a
patient
access
abortion
,
assisted
---------------

Today
it’s
often
Christians
who
are
being
pressured
to
violate
their
conscience
.


However
,
there
are
others
who
seek
the
same
protections
for
their
conscience
.


It’s
this
freedom
that
an
atheist
doctor
appeals
to
when
he
determines
he
cannot
participate
in
euthanasia
,
based
on
his
oath
to
do
no
harm
.


And
what
of
the
fashion
designers
,
back
in
2016
,
who
---------------

For
Christians
,
the
answer
to
the
questions
above
might
be
easy
.


But
we
have
our
own
disputes
about
conscience
within
the
Church
as
well
,
such
as
what
kind
of
entertainment
is
permissible
or
what
it
looks
like
to
honor
the
Sabbath
Day
outside
of
corporate
worship
.



When
conscience
pricks

Of
note
,
the
strongest
commands
of
conscience
are
often
negative
,
in
terms
of
what
you
are
not
permitted
to
do
,
rather
than
what
you
may
or
must
do
.


For
example
,
if
you
use
foul
language
,
your
conscience
will
likely
bother
you
more
than
if
you
fail
to
correct
someone
else
using
such
language
.


Or
,
if
a
publisher
prints
pro-abortion
pamphlets
that
he
objects
to
,
his
conscience
will
make
him
feel
guilty
more
than
if
he
fails
to
promote
life
as
he
believes
he
ought
.



When
the
conscience
commands
a
person
not
to
do
something
,
the
command
is
about
a
very
specific
action
.


Alternatively
,
if
the
command
is
instead
to
act
on
something
good
,
there
are
often
various
ways
of
pursuing
that
good
.



Conscience
and
the
Church

Because
of
sin
,
no
person’s
conscience
is
perfectly
aligned
with
what
God
commands
in
His
Word
.


The
chart
below
is
based
on
one
from
a
helpful
book
titled
Conscience
:
What
It
Is
,
How
To
Train
It
,
and
Loving
Those
Who
Differ
,
by
Andrew
Naselli
and
J
.

D
.


Crowley
.


The
authors
used
it
to
explain
the
difference
between
two
people’s
consciences
,
and
how
they
compare
to
God’s
will
.


The
letters
within
the
chart
refer
to
different
rules
or
principles
of
right
and
wrong
.



Both
Arnold
and
Zoey
have
added
rules
to
their
conscience
that
are
not
commanded
in
Scripture
.


For
example
,
perhaps
Arnold
has
a
history
of
alcohol
abuse
in
his
family
,
so
he
adds
letter
‘C’
which
commands
him
---------------
Arnold’s
belief
that
he
must
not
play
cards
or
any
games
involving
dice
.


Arnold
and
Zoey
have
also
both
failed
to
include
letter
‘B’
in
their
conscience
.


Perhaps
this
is
a
failure
to
consistently
honor
the
Sabbath
Day
,
and
their
consciences
no
longer
accuse
them
for
it
.


However
,
Arnold
and
Zoey’s
consciences
are
both
aligned
with
God’s
will
in
letters
‘J’
through
‘M
,’
where
they
have
rightly
applied
biblical
principles
and
commands
to
their
lives
and
consciences
.


The
natural
tendency
is
to
think
that
if
another
person
has
more
rules
than
us
,
they
are
legalistic
.


Alternatively
,
if
they
have
fewer
rules
,
they
are
failing
to
live
as
Christians
.


However
,
Scripture
remains
the
standard
to
which
we
must
seek
to
align
our
conscience
.



[]

The
conscience
can
easily
become
oversensitive
by
including
rules
that
are
not
matters
of
right
and
wrong
.


We
see
examples
of
the
Pharisees
in
the
New
Testament
who
created
additional
rules
for
the
Sabbath
and
---------------
we
do
not
abide
by
similar
rules
on
the
Sabbath
.



Alternatively
,
conscience
can
become
desensitized
.


Perhaps
you
use
or
tolerate
foul
language
that
would
have
shocked
you
a
decade
ago
,
or
you
consume
entertainment
that
you
would
have
been
ashamed
of
years
earlier
.


Our
conscience
does
not
always
accurately
tell
us
what
is
sin
and
what
is
not
.


While
it
might
not
always
make
sense
to
follow
conscience
in
relation
to
other
authorities
,
we
have
a
duty
to
obey
it
because
we
cannot
commit
what
we
believe
is
sin
.



At
the
same
time
,
we
should
be
careful
when
dealing
with
the
consciences
of
other
people
.


In
1
Corinthians
8
,
the
Apostle
Paul
talks
about
whether
believers
can
eat
meat
offered
to
idols
and
refers
to
consideration
for
brothers
and
sisters
with
a
weaker
conscience
.


So
,
if
we
believe
a
brother
or
sister
has
a
weaker
conscience
,
we
must
not
be
a
stumbling
block
to
them
and
cause
them
to
disobey
their
conscience
.


On
disputable
issues
,
we
may
realize
that
someone
has
a
weaker
conscience
,
and
we
can
discuss
the
biblical
principles
that
apply
.


Or
perhaps
they
have
a
stronger
conscience
,
and
they
can
help
us
understand
where
our
conscience
is
not
aligned
to
Scripture
.



Again
,
conscience
is
not
meant
to
be
some
wishy-washy
idea
where
everyone
can
believe
what
they
want
,
like
in
the
time
of
the
judges
of
Israel
,
when
“everyone
did
what
was
right
in
his
own
eyes
.

”
There
are
---------------
authorities
versus
our
callings
to
obey
what
God
demands
of
us
?


What
about
masking
,
vaccines
,
etc
.


,
both
within
the
public
square
and
the
Church
?


Christian
conscience
differs
on
these
issues
,
and
believers
can
have
biblical
arguments
for
why
they
think
God
commands
or
prohibits
different
actions
.



What
isn’t
conscience
?



Some
of
us
might
react
to
the
idea
that
conscience
is
a
kind
of
subjective
belief
that
is
not
accountable
to
other
people
.


We
can’t
simply
say
,
“well
,
what’s
right
for
you
isn’t
necessarily
right
for
me
.

”
Conscience
is
not
merely
a
personal
preference
like
your
favorite
food
or
music
.


It
is
also
not
license
to
do
whatever
you
please
and
ignore
other
authorities
.


Rather
,
freedom
of
conscience
refers
to
moral
beliefs
that
respect
a
limited
sphere
of
individual
authority
while
still
recognizing
other
legitimate
authorities
that
can
impose
obligations
on
us
.



As
such
,
the
conscience
is
not
unlimited
.


Some
people
might
abuse
the
ability
to
claim
conscientious
objection
out
of
self-interest
or
to
simply
justify
their
actions
.


Authorities
such
as
the
civil
government
,
---------------

However
,
if
the
civil
government
(or
other
authorities)
limits
conscience
,
they
must
provide
good
justification
for
doing
so
and
seek
to
accommodate
conscientious
objectors
as
much
as
they
are
able
,
such
as
through
exemptions
for
freedom
of
conscience
.


Abraham
Kuyper
again
shows
the
importance
of
conscience
,
stating
that
:

“Ten
times
better
is
a
state
in
which
a
few
eccentrics
can
make
themselves
a
laughingstock
for
a
time
by
abusing
freedom
of
conscience
,
than
a
state
in
which
these
eccentricities
are
prevented
by
violating
conscience
itself
.

”

Conclusion

Ultimately
,
conscience
belongs
to
an
individual
and
is
accountable
to
God
.


However
,
it
should
also
be
rooted
in
Biblical
commands
and
principles
.

Human

Should

In

there’s
been
a
worrying
downward
trend
for

This

By
“intellectual
conscience
,”
Nietzsche
means
the
idea
that
it
is
wrong
to
believe
something
unless
you
have
good
reason
to
think
that
the
belief
is
true
.


Someone
with
an
intellectual
conscience
will
form
and
endorse
beliefs
by
applying
the
best
epistemic
standards
known
to
him
or
her
.



Most
of
us
,
Nietzsche
thinks
,
lack
an
intellectual
conscience
:

[T]he

of

I
mean
:
the
great
majority
of

it

to

Although

one

The

How
does
the
conscious
differ
from
the
conscience
?


Being
conscious
is
the
state
of
being
awake
and
alert
.


Conscience
,
on
the
other
hand
,
refers
to
an
awareness
of
whether
actions
are
right
or
wrong
.



---------------
At
a
Glance

While
the
two
terms
are
often
confused
,
the
conscious
and
the
conscience
refer
to
very
different
things
.


Your
conscious
allows
you
to
be
aware
of
your
place
in
the
world
,
while
your
conscience
allows
you
to
behave
in
this
world
in
morally
and
socially
acceptable
ways
.


As
described
below
,
being
conscious
refers
to
your
awareness
of
yourself
and
the
world
around
you
.


Your
conscience
is
your
ability
to
distinguish
between
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
.




What
Does
Conscience
Mean
?




Your
conscience
is
the
part
of
your
personality
that
helps
you
determine
right
and
wrong
and
keeps
you
from
acting
upon
your
most
basic
urges
and
desires
.



Your
conscience
is
what
makes
you
feel
guilty
when
you
do
something
bad
and
good
when
you
do
something
kind
.



---------------
even
altruistic
ways
.



In
Freudian
theory
,
the
conscience
is
part
of
the
superego
that
contains
information
about
what
is
viewed
as
bad
or
negative
by
your
parents
and
by
society—all
the
values
you
learned
and
absorbed
during
your
upbringing
.


The
conscience
emerges
over
time
as
you
take
in
information
about
what
is
considered
right
and
wrong
by
your
caregivers
,
your
peers
,
and
the
culture
in
which
you
live
.


---------------
caregiver
'
s
rules
.


For
example
,
if
a
parent
sets
a
rule
,
a
child
could
learn
a
sense
of
right
and
wrong
regarding
that
topic
.


Studies
have
also
examined
other
factors
that
may
affect
the
way
conscience
develops
,
including
the
nature
of
the
parent-child
relationship
,
style
of
parental
discipline
,
and
the
child
'
s
temperament—but
more
research
is
needed
.


---------------

Breaking
Down
the
Differences


Conscience

-
Noun
---------------

To
further
explain
their
differences
,
here
are
examples
of
how
the
terms
conscience
and
conscious
could
be
used
in
a
sentence
.




Conscience


They
had
a
guilty
conscience
because
they
cheated
on
the
test
.



The
term
conscience
here
describes
this
person
'
s
sense
of
what
is
right
and
wrong
and
the
subsequent
feeling
of
guilt
they
have
over
cheating
on
the
test
.


---------------

When
thinking
about
these
two
concepts
,
just
remember
that
conscious
means
to
be
awake
and
aware
while
conscience
refers
to
your
inner
sense
of
right
and
wrong
.

to

After

Nietzsche’s
interest

consideration
,
however
,
has
been
devoted
to
what
was
believed
to
link
the
psychological
to
the
metaethical
:
the
mental
habit
or
act
of
conscience
(and
its
sister-concept
of
synderesis)
,
though

in
the
subject
has

resurgence

.



What
is
the
scope
and
nature
of
this
apparent
ability
to
intuitively
grasp
right
from
wrong
?


Can
conscience
err
and
,
if
so
,
do
its
dictates
still
bind
?


The
best
way
to
address
these
and
other
questions
is
to
employ
a
developmental
approach
.


The
term
conscience
is
still
generally
used
to
refer
to
an
innate
moral
sense
,
but
it
has
slightly
different
connotations
today
than
it
did
in
the
medieval
period
,
which
in
turn
had
different
connotations
from
what
preceded
it
in
pagan
antiquity
and
in
Scripture
.


Still
,
medieval
theories
of
conscience
drew
extensively
on
these
earlier
sources
.


Since
the
concepts
of
conscience
and
synderesis
evolved
over
time

then
,
it
will
be
necessary
to
take
a
linear
approach
to

The
Ancient
Context
:
Judicial
Conscience

To
understand
the
medieval
theory
of
conscience
,
it
is
essential
to
examine
its
etymology
.


Unlike
most
philosophical
categories
that
are
central
to
medieval
thought
,
the
concept
of
conscience
did
not
have
its
origins
in
Plato
or
Aristotle
(Potts
1982
:
687)
.


Rather
,
most
scholars
agree
,
it
originated
in
the
Greek
playwrights
of
the
fifth
century
BCE
---------------
1961
:
5)
.



The
English
word
“conscience”
is
derived
from
the
Latin
conscientia
.


Its
Greek
equivalent
is
syneidesis
.


Both
terms
connote
a
state
or
act
of
“sharing
knowledge
with
oneself”
(Sorabji
2014
:
12)
.


This
knowledge
is
---------------
objects
in
the
outside
world
but
can
also
“turn
back
on”
(reflectere)
or
become
an
object
to
themselves
.


As

put
it
in
his
study
of
the
concept

of

in

tradition
:

might

defined
as

---------------

also
Sorabji
2014
:

Lewis
refers
to
this
primarily
pagan
understanding
of
conscience
as
an
“inner
witness”
.


It
does
not
judge
our
actions
as
right
or
wrong
,
but
merely
testifies
to
their
existence
:
---------------

some
other
way
.


(Lewis
1960
:
190)

Others
,
however
,
regard
the
sort
of
conscience
that
Lewis
describes
here
as
a
type
of
internal
judge
,
and
therefore
refer
to
it
as
“judicial
conscience”
(D’Arcy
1961
:
8)
.


While
this
property
of
the
mind
does
not
necessarily
issue
binding
rules
,
it
does
pass
moral
judgements
on
our
deeds
.


It
would
,
however
,
eventually
take
on
the
role
of
issuing
moral
dictates
for
future
acts
as
well
.


Eric
D’Arcy
refers
to
this
later
form
of
syneidesis
or
conscientia
as
the
“legislative
conscience”
whose
innovator
,
he
argues
,
was
the
Apostle
Paul
(ca
.


5
CE–ca
.


64/67
CE)
,
the
most
important
founder
of
the
Christian
faith
after
Jesus
of
Nazareth
(D’Arcy
1961
:
8)
.

St
.


Paul
:
Legislative
Conscience

The
judicial
understanding
of
conscience
continued
well
into
the
first
century
of
the
Common
Era
.


To
be
sure
,
Paul
himself
continued
to
employ
it
.


At
the
same
time
,
D’Arcy
credited
Paul
with
introducing
,
in
addition
to
the
“judicial
conscience”
,
a
novel
conception
he
termed
the
“legislative
conscience”
.


It
is
not
difficult
to
see
why
the
earlier
judicial
conception
would
later
take
on
legislative
features
.


This
is
because
the
ability
to
judge
past
actions
as
either
right
or
wrong—and
---------------

by
the
law
,
they
are
a
law
for
themselves
,
even
though
they
do
not

have
the
law
.


They
show
that
the
requirements
of
the
law
are
written

on
their
hearts
,
their
consciences
also
bearing
witness
,
and
their

thoughts
sometimes
accusing
them
and
at
other
times
even
defending

them
.


(Romans
2
:14–15
;
NIV)
---------------
latter
was
later
glossed
as
a
reference
to
the
natural
law
,
which
is
accessible
to
all
people
,
non-Jews
included
,
and
is
consistent
with
the
Mosaic
Law
.


Notice
that
,
according
to
the
foregoing
passage
,
conscience
(syneidesis)
is
not
the
ultimate
source
of
right
and
wrong
.


Rather
,
the
foundation
of
right
and
wrong
is
the
objective
moral
law
,
which
is
both
“written
on
[men’s]
hearts”
and
borne
witness
to
by
conscience
.



One
might
say
,
then
,
that
the
objective
norm
of
morality
on
Paul’s
account
is
the
moral
law
(or
natural
law)
.


Conscience
,
however
,
might
be
termed
morality’s
subjective
norm
.


This
is
made
clear
in
another
passage
from
St
.


Paul
,
where
he
is
addressing
the
question
of
whether
it
is
---------------
since
“food
does
not
bring
us
near
to
God—we
are
no
worse
if
we
do
not
eat
,
and
no
better
if
we
do”
(1
Corinthians
8
:8
;
NIV)
.


Still
,
even
though
the
consciences
of
such
Christians
are
erroneous
,
they
must
follow
them
since
conscience
,
Paul
suggests
,
is
a
rule
of
conduct
(Romans
14
:13–23)
.


Eric
D’Arcy
sums
up
these
two
important
contributions
of
St
.


Paul
as
follows
:


St
.


Paul
,
then
,
introduces
an
entirely
new
phase
in
the
history
of
the

term
“conscience”
in
moral
theory
,
and
two
new
features
characterize

his
use
of
it
.


First
,
it
is
to
play
a
directive
role
before
action

takes
place
.


In
the
pagan
writers
,
conscience
did
not
appear
on
the

scene
until
after
the
action
was
performed
,
and
its
role
was
purely

judicial
;
but
in
St
.


Paul
,
conscience
is
credited
with
a
legislative

function
,
and
it
induces
an
obligation
in
the
proper
sense
.


Second
,

conscience
is
fallible
:
the
directions
it
issues
may
be
mistaken
;
but

whether
it
be
mistaken
or
not
,
it
seems
that
we
are
bound
to
follow

its
rulings
.


(D’Arcy
1961
:
11–12)

In
sum
,
we
might
follow
Sorabji’s
suggestion
that
this
phase
in
the
development
of
the
concept
of
conscience—that
is
,
from
its
origins
in
fifth-century
BCE
Greek
literature
to
the
first-century
CE—has
eight
features
(Sorabji
2014
:
36)
.

St
.


Jerome
:
The
Invention
of
Synderesis

That
conscience
was
so
central
a
concept
in
St
.


Paul’s
writings
guaranteed
it
an
important
place
in
the
moral
theology
of
the
Greek
and
Latin
Fathers
,
especially
St
.


Basil
,
John
Damascene
and
St
.


Ambrose
.


---------------
and
the
ox’s
face
the
appetitive
part
(cf
.


Plato
,
Republic
,
436b–441b)
.


What
did
the
eagle
represent
?


According
to
Jerome
,
it
represented
that
“spark
of
conscience”
(scintilla
conscientiae)
which
makes
us
aware
of
our
sinfulness
when
reason
,
spirit
or
desire
become
disordered
.


Medieval
manuscripts
refer
to
this
psychological
property
as
synderesis
(or
---------------

Now
above
these
three
was
the
eagle
;
so
in
the
soul
,
they
say
,
above

the
other
three
elements
and
beyond
them
is
a
fourth
,
which
the
Greeks

call
synderesis
.


This
is
that
spark
of
conscience
which
was
not

quenched
even
in
the
heart
of
Cain
,
when
he
was
driven
out
of

paradise
.


This
it
is
that
which
makes
us
,
too
,
feel
our
sinfulness
---------------

by
sham
Reason
.


It
is
natural
to
identify
synderesis
with
the
eagle
,

since
it
is
distinct
from
the
other
three
elements
and
corrects
them

when
they
err
[…]
However
,
we
also
see
that
this
conscience

(conscientia)
is
cast
down
in
some
people
,
who
have
neither
shame
nor

insight
regarding
their
offences
,
and
loses
its
place
[…]
.


(commentary
---------------
however
,
he
does
admit
the
existence
of
those
who
are
shameless
and
lacking
in
moral
insight
.


Such
people
are
oblivious
to
their
offenses
because
,
according
to
Jerome
,
their
conscience
(conscientia)
ceases
to
be
present
in
them
(“looses
its
place”)
.


If
synderesis
cannot
be
lost
,
but
conscience
can
,
then
it
seems
to
follow
that
they
are
separate
properties
of
the
soul
.


In
any
case
,
whatever
Jerome’s
intention
,
this
curious
passage
was
indirectly
handed
down
to
the
Middle
Ages
via

Peter
Lombard
:
The
Scholastic
Origins
of
the
Debate

Peter
Lombard’s
role
in
the
evolution
of
the
concept
of
conscience
is
both
surprising
and
unsurprising
.


It
is—at
first
sight
,
anyway—surprising
because
Lombard
does
not
discuss
conscience
or
synderesis
in
any
actual
detail
.


Indeed
,
he
does
not
,
strictly
speaking
,
mention
the
terms
“synderesis”
or
“conscience”
at
all
.


What
he
does
is
merely
to
allude
to
Jerome’s
commentary
on
Ezekiel
in
the
context
of
discussing
the
will’s
role
in
how
rational
agents
can
naturally
want
---------------

Lombard’s
brief
mention
of
Jerome’s
“spark
of
reason”
(sic)
in
the
aforementioned
passage
is
the
full
extent
of
his
treatment
of
conscience
and
synderesis
.


Still
,
that
was
sufficient
to
ensure
that
it
would
receive
robust
attention
by
later
scholastics
,
who
would
track
down
the
---------------
turned
to
Jerome’s
text
in
order
to
scrutinize
the
original
passage
.


There
,
they
discovered
his
apparent
distinction
between
synderesis
and
conscience
,
which
in
turn
would
come
to
frame
the
parameters
of
the
later
medieval
debate
.


If
synderesis
and
conscience
are
in
fact
two
separate
parts
of
the
soul
,
for
instance
,
what
is
their
relationship
to
one
another
?


What
,
come
to
that
,
are
their
respective
natures
and
,
---------------
Stephen
Langton
(1155–1228)
,
regent
master
of
theology
at
Paris
and
later
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
is
important
in
the
present
context
less
for
any
systematic
treatment
of
conscience—indeed
Stephen
scarcely
touches
on
the
issue
at
all—than
for
his
somewhat
scattered
views
on
synderesis
.


The
relevant
treatment
comes
in
Stephen’s
Quaestiones
---------------
1948
:
113)
.


D’Arcy
sums
up
Langton’s
position
as
follows
:


Remorse
of
conscience
is
the
work
,
not
of
synderesis
,
but
of
reason
,

for
synderesis
remains
at
the
level
of
general
principles
,
whereas

reason
descends
to
the
concrete
case
;
but
it
is
precisely
over
the

concrete
case
that
remorse
of
conscience
is
felt
;
hence
it
is
by

reason
,
and
not
by
synderesis
,
that
we
sin
.


(D’Arcy
1961
:
23–24)

as
we
will
see
,
influence
later
thinkers
such
as
Aquinas
.

Philip
the
Chancellor
:
The
First
Systematic
Treatment
of
Synderesis
and
Conscience

Although
Stephen
Langton
was
the
first
scholastic
to
touch
on
the
issue
of
synderesis
in
any
depth
,
it
was
Philip
the
Chancellor
(ca
.


1170–1237)
who
wrote
the
first
treatise
devoted
to
exploring
the
relationship
between
synderesis
and
conscience
(Lottin
1948
:
139–157)
.


As
chancellor
of
Notre
Dame
,
Philip
had
the
right
to
grant
the
license
to
teach
in
the
theology
faculty
at
Paris
,
and
it
was
under
his
tenure
that
the
---------------
for
the
former
,
and
one
for
the
latter
.


Although
primarily
an
administrator
,
Philip
was
also
a
trained
theologian
.


His
most
important
work
is
the
Summa
de
bono
,
which
includes
the
treatise
on
conscience
.



In
his
treatise
Philip
sets
out
to
answer
several
questions
related
to
---------------
who
apparently
share
the
view
that
synderesis
is
a
faculty
of
the
soul
independent
of
the
others
(Philip
the
Chancellor
,
Summa
de
bono
:
Treatise
on
Conscience
;
Potts
trans
.


1980
:
95–96)
.



Against
the
claim
that
synderesis
is
a
power
of
the
soul
,
Philip
---------------

is
a
disposition
arising
naturally
in
conjunction
with
that

potentiality
by
which
the
natural
will
is
directed
to
what
is
good

without
qualification
.


(Summa
de
bono
:
Treatise
on
Conscience
;
Potts

trans
.


1980
:
96)

---------------

potentiality
or
a
disposition
,
the
right
answer
lies
in
taking

something
in
between
:
a
dispositional
potentiality
.


(Summa
de
bono
:

Treatise
on
Conscience
;
Potts
trans
.


1980
:
97)

It
would
seem
,
then
,
that
synderesis
is
a
potentiality
,
albeit
an
---------------
Philip
puts
it
,
synderesis
is
that
which
“murmurs
back
against
sin
and
correctly
contemplates
and
wants
what
is
good
without
qualification”
(Summa
de
bono
:
Treatise
on
Conscience
;
Potts
trans
.


1980
:
100)
.



On
the
matter
of
conscience
and
how
it
is
related
to
synderesis
,
Philip
distinguishes
them
.


For
one
thing
,
conscience
can
be
mistaken
while
synderesis
cannot
.


Specifically
,
conscience
is
the
result
of
a
concurrence
of
synderesis
with
free
decision
(liberum
arbitrium)
.


Put
otherwise
,
it
is
the
specific
application
of
a
general
moral
principle
that
is
the
outcome
of
deliberation
.


When
correctly
applied
,
conscience
is
correct
.


When
incorrectly
applied
,
it
errs
.


In
either
case
,
the
judgement
of
conscience
generates
a
moral
obligation
to
act
.


Philip
uses
the
following
example
of
how
synderesis
,
which
is
always
right
,
can
nonetheless
conjoin
with
an
erring
conscience
(Potts
1980
:
104)
:

.


Unerring
universal
premise
of
synderesis
:

premise

Son
of
God”
.


3
.


Erring
judgement
of
conscience
:
“Therefore
this
Christ
fellow
should

be
put
to
death”

From
the
foregoing
example
,
it
is
clear
that
synderesis
delivers
a
general
,
non-deliberative
proposition
,
while
conscience
yields
what
Potts
calls
a
particular
,
“deontic
proposition”

St

Bonaventure
:
Conscience
as
Cognitive/Synderesis
as
Affective

One
of
the
most
prominent
representatives
of
the
Franciscan
intellectual
---------------
faculty
,
a
position
he
held
until
1257
.


His
commentary
on
the
Sentences
is
the
fruit
of
these
lectures
,
and
it
is
in
this
work
that
he
discusses
the
topics
of
conscience
and
synderesis
.


For
Bonaventure
we
not
only
possess
innate
moral
knowledge
,
but
we
also
have
an
inextinguishable
inclination
towards
achieving
the
good
.


Our
inborn
knowledge
of
the
former
,
that
is
,
of
the
natural
law
,
is
associated
with
conscience
,
which
resides
in
the
intellect
,
while
our
inclination
towards
desiring
the
good
is
associated
with
synderesis
,
which
inheres
in
the
will
.



What
is
the
ontological
status
of
conscience
?


According
to
Bonaventure
,
just
as
theologians
have
disagreed
over
the
nature
of
“thought”
,
defining
it
variously
as
the
power
of
thinking
,
a
habit
or
an
apprehended
principle
of
knowledge
,
so
too
have
they
differed
over
how
to
define
“conscience”
(conscientia)
.


Most
commonly
,
however
,
the
term
has
been
used
to
refer
to
a
cognitive
habit
or
disposition
that
relates
to
the
practical
as
opposed
to
the
theoretical
intellect
.


Indeed
,
it
is
---------------


theoretical
knowledge
perfects
our
thought
to
the
extent
that
the

latter
is
theoretical
,
whereas
conscience
is
a
disposition
perfecting

our
thought
to
the
extent
that
it
is
practical
,
or
to
the
extent
that

it
directs
us
towards
deeds
.


(Bonaventure

---------------
Is
such
a
disposition
innate
or
acquired
?


It
is
possible
,
according
to
Bonaventure
,
to
find
authorities
on
both
sides
of
the
debate
.


For
the
opinion
that
conscience
is
innate
,
Bonaventure
cites
,
among
other
authorities
,
St
.


Paul’s
famous
reference
to
a
moral
law
that
is
“written
on
[men’s]
hearts”
in
Romans
1
:14–15
.


He
also
appeals
to
a
“natural
instinct
to
seek
blessedness
and
[to]
honor
[one’s]
parents”
(commentary

.


For
the
opinion
that
conscience
is
not
innate
,
on
the
other
hand
,
Bonaventure
cites
Aristotle’s
claim
that
the
soul
is
a
blank
slate
.


Bonaventure’s
solution
is
to
find
a
middle
position
between
St
.


Paul
,
on
the
one
hand
,
and
Aristotle
,
on
the
other
.


His
conclusion
:
conscience
is
part
innate
,
part
acquired
.



---------------
principles
of
practical
reason
.


This
innate
capacity
to
immediately
grasp
such
principles
as
true
or
not
in
the
realm
of
practical
reason
is
called
conscience
.


It
is
associated
,
for
Bonaventure
,
with
the
Augustinian
“natural
light”—or
“natural
tribunal”—that
is
built
into
the
structure
of
the
mind
and
which
permits
rational
agents
to

and
“Do
not
harm
thy
neighbour”
.



In
what
sense
,
though
,
is
conscience
acquired
?


Although
the
ability
to
judge
the
deontic
propositions
of
the
natural
law
as
self-evidently
true
is
innate
,
it
does
not
follow
that
the
contents
of
such
propositions
are

Conscience

then
,
is
partly
innate

partly
acquired

respect
to

But
what
is
the
relationship
of
such
universal
premises
to

conclusions
of

?

that

not

an

of
an
erroneous
conscience
(Bonaventure
argues
that
male
circumcision
and
the
prohibition
on
eating
pork
are
no
longer
applicable)

This

whether

Is
one
obliged
to
always
follow
one’s
conscience
?


It
depends
,
since
conscience
is
fallible
.


If
what
it
dictates
is
in

with
God’s
will
,
then
one
is
obliged
to
follow
it
on
pain
of

If
erroneous—if
what
it
dictates
is
contrary
to
the
divine
will—as
is
sometimes
the
case
when
applying
basic
deontological
principles
,
then
conscience
does
not
bind
.


Rather
,
the
agent
has
an
obligation
to
correct
the
error
in

to
bring
his
conscience
into

with

natural

If
he

and
follows

he

synderesis
,
for
Bonaventure
,
is
precisely
the
counterpart
of
conscience
insofar
as
the
will
,
like
the
intellect
,
has
an
innate
inclination
towards
the
moral
(as
opposed
to
the
useful)
good
.


In
the
case
of
the
intellect
this
disposition
takes
the
form
of
the
“natural
light”
of
conscience
that
apprehends
the
first
principles
of
the
natural
law
;
in
the
case
of
the
will
,
it
takes
the
form
of
synderesis
:
a
“natural
bias”
towards
desiring
the
moral
good
.


There
is
one
sense
,
however
,
in
which
synderesis
is
not
exactly
analogous
to
conscience
.


While
it
looks
very
much
like
a
habit
,
synderesis
is
rather
,
according
to
Bonaventure
(presumably
following
Philip
the
Chancellor)
,
a
habit-like
power
of
the
soul
(commentary
on
---------------
pleasure
or
is
so
stubbornly
persistent
in
their
depravity
that
they
cannot
reorient
themselves
towards
the
good
.


Still
,
when
synderesis
follows
the
innate
judgement
of
conscience
with
respect
to
basic
deontic
principles
,
which
can
never
err
,
then
it
too
functions
correctly
because
that
is
its
natural
state
.


It

St
Thomas
Aquinas
:
Synderesis
and
Conscience
as
Cognitive

Thomas
Aquinas
(1224/25–1274)
is
,
by
any
measure
,
one
of
the
most
important
,
if
not
the
most
important
,
scholastic
theologian
of
the
later
Middle
Ages
.


Although
his
views
on
conscience
and
synderesis
have
received
less
attention
in
recent
years
than
his
theory
of
natural
law
,
this
is
unjustified
.


For
the
scholastics
,
a
full
account
of
morality
---------------
knowledge
of
right
and
wrong
.



Aquinas
discussed
the
issues
of
synderesis
and
conscience
in
several
of
his
major
works
,
from
his
early
commentary
on
the
Sentences
and
the
De
veritate
to
his
mature
Summa
theologica
(see
D’Arcy
1961
:
36–47)
.


As
---------------
“habit-like
faculty”
.


Aquinas
,
as
might
be
expected
,
hews
much
closer
to
his
Dominican
mentor
and
teacher
Albert
the
Great
(ca
.


1200–1280)
for
whom
both
synderesis
and
conscience
belong
to
the
intellect
(see
Dougherty
2018
:
221)
.



---------------
object
of
the
practical
intellect
is
the
good
“under
the
aspect
of
truth”
(Thomas
Aquinas
,
Summa
theologica
I
,
q
.


79
,

.

,

.


Synderesis
and
conscience
,
for
Aquinas
,
both
belong
to
the
practical
intellect
.



---------------
Like
speculative
reasoning
,
practical
reasoning
generally
takes
a
deductive
form
.


Just
as
science
is
the
conclusion
of
the
demonstrative
syllogism
,
so
conscience
is
the
conclusion
of
a
practical
syllogism
.


The
practical
syllogism
,
like
the
demonstrative
syllogism
,
contains
a
major
premise
,
a
minor
premise
and
a
conclusion
.


The
major
premise
is
drawn
or
---------------
and
minor
premises
,
a
conclusion
is
drawn
that
generates
a
moral
obligation
to
act
(Hoffmann
2012
:
258)
.


This
inferential
judgment
is
associated
,
for
Aquinas
,
with
conscience
:
an
act—as
opposed
to
a
faculty
or
a
habit—that
includes
a
number
of
applications
,
such
as
“to
witness
,
to
bind
,
or
incite
,
and
also
to
accuse
,
torment
,
or
rebuke”
(Thomas
Aquinas
,
Summa
theologica
I
,
q
.


79
,
a
.


13
,
corp
.

)
.



Conscience
acts
as
a
“witness”
when
it
is
consciously
aware
of
some
personal
wrongdoing
,
whether
of
commission
or
omission
.


It
“binds”
or
“incites”
when
it
makes
a
judgement
that
some
act
should
be
performed
.


Finally
,
it
“accuses”
,
“torments”
or
“rebukes”
when
it
judges
that
some
past
action
was
either
morally
acceptable
or
it
was
not
.


Although
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
conscience
in
the
first
sense—conscience
as
witness—can
function
as
an
application
of
knowledge
to
conduct
,
this
seems
less
problematic
in
the
second
and
third
senses
of
the
term
,
which
harken
back
to
the
legislative
and
judicial
senses
of
conscience
found
in
St
.


Paul
and
pagan
antiquity
,
respectively
(D’Arcy
1961
:
46)
.


In
any
case
,
an
example
of
the
way
in
which
conscience
applies
the
natural
law—whose
principles
are
apprehended
by
synderesis—
is
articulated
in
Aquinas’s
De
veritate
:
---------------

higher
reason
presents
this
minor
premise
“sexual
intercourse
with

this
woman
is
forbidden
by
the
law
of
God”
,
the
application
of

conscience
will
be
made
by
concluding
:
“this
sexual
intercourse
is
to

be
avoided”
.


(De
veritate
,
q
.


17
,
a
.


2
,
corp
.


;
cited
in
Dougherty

2018
:
222)

Now
the
dictates
of
conscience
can
either
be
right
,
if
correctly
deduced
from
the
natural
law
,
or
wrong
,
if
they
are
incorrectly
deduced
.


The
dictates
of
the
former
are
the
product
of
a
“correct
conscience”
and
the
judgements
of
the
latter
are
the
result
of
an
“erroneous
conscience”
.


Since
synderesis
is
infallible
,
the
main
source
of
an
erroneous
conscience
,
when
it
does
occur
,
is
the
agent’s
adoption
of
a
faulty
minor
premise
in
the
practical
syllogism
(De
veritate
q
.


17
,
a
.


2
;
Potts
trans
.


1980
:
132–133)
.



Now
it
is
clear
that
we
have
an
obligation
to
follow
a
correct
conscience
since
to
do
so
contributes
to
achieving
our
final
end
.


But
what
of
an
erroneous
conscience
?


Does
this
have
any
authority
?


For
Aquinas
,
an
erring
conscience
also
binds
.


It
does
not
,
however
,
necessarily
excuse
.


As
Hoffmann
puts
it
,


regardless
of
whether
my
action
is
objectively
good
,
evil
or

indifferent
,
conscience
binds
,
for
it
is
by
means
of
conscience
that

an
action
is
proposed
to
me
as
good
,
bad
,
or
indifferent
.


(Hoffmann

2012
:
260)
---------------
refrains
.


According
to
Aquinas
,
this
agent
,
although
he
does
what
is
objectively
right
,
nonetheless
sins
.


Why
?


Because
in
choosing
the
opposite
of
what
his
conscience
dictated
,
he
chose
to
do
something
he
believed
to
be
evil
.


And
choosing
what
is
(subjectively
if
not
objectively)
wrong
,
for
Aquinas
,
is
a
sin
:
“[F]
from
the
very
fact
that
---------------
thereto
becomes
evil”
(Summa
theologica
,
I-II
,
q
.


19
,
a
.


5
,
corp
.

)
.



What
follows
from
this
is
that
conscience
,
whether
right
or
erroneous
,
always
binds
.


As
to
the
question
of
whether
an
erroneous
conscience
excuses
,
on
the
other
hand
,
that
depends
on
the
type
of
ignorance
that
causes
it
.


This
is
because
some
types
of
ignorance
render
an
act
---------------

theologica
I-II
,
q
.


19
,
a
.


6
,
corp
.

)

Ignorance
that
contributes
to
an
erroneous
conscience
that
is
in
any
way
voluntary
is
vincible
,
or
able
to
be
corrected
,
and
therefore
culpable
if
followed
.


This
generally
happens
where
the
agent’s
ignorance
of
the
---------------
Unfortunately
,
as
we
have
seen
,
such
precepts
are
of
a
very
general
character
,
such
as
“do
good
and
avoid
evil”
.


For
such
general
knowledge
to
be
applicable
by
conscience
,
it
must
be
further
specified
.


This
further
specification
comprises
the
secondary
precepts
of
the
natural
law
,
which
are
closely
drawn
from
the
former
precepts
and
from
natural
---------------

A
final
problem
seems
to
emerge
:
are
we
not
,
according
to
Aquinas’s
account
of
the
erroneous
conscience
,
left
with
the
possibility
of
a
moral
dilemma
?


For
if
we
have
an
obligation
to
always
follow
our
consciences
,
but
we
sometimes
sin
when
we
do
follow
them
,
then
it
seems
that
we
are
sometimes
put
into
a
double
bind
.


We
seem
,
that
is
,
to
sometimes
have
conflicting
obligations
so
that
regardless
of
what
we
do
,
we
sin
.


Aquinas’s
solution
is
that
it
is
only
wrong
to
follow
a
conscience
that
is
in
a
state
of
vincible
ignorance
.


Since
such
ignorance
is
by
definition
correctable
,
we
can
always
resolve
the
apparent
dilemma
by
choosing
to
put
aside
our
ignorance
.


As
far
as
acting
from
invincible
ignorance
is
concerned
,
we
are
pardoned
.

William
of
Ockham
:
New
Directions
in
the
Understanding
of
Synderesis
and
Conscience

With
the
fourteenth-century
theologian
William
of
Ockham
(1285–1347)
we
encounter
some
radically
new
developments
on
the
topics
of
synderesis
and
conscience
.


While
Ockham’s
Franciscan
predecessor
John
Duns
Scotus
had
disagreements
with
Aquinas
about
the
nature
of
the
moral
law
,
Scotus
fundamentally
agreed
with
the
Dominican
in
viewing
synderesis
and
conscience
a
habit
and
an
act
of
the
practical
reason
,
respectively
,
whose
jobs
were
to
apprehend
the
basic
principles
of
morality
in
the
case
of
synderesis
,
and
to
apply
them
in
the
case
of
conscience
(John
Duns
Scotus
,
Ordinatio
2
,
d
.


39
;
Wolter
trans
.


1997
:
162–163)
.


Like
Scotus
,
Ockham
also
agrees
with
Aquinas
in
several
crucial
respects
.


---------------
tradition
which
preceded
him
,
however
,
is
in
his
abandonment
of
the
concept
of
synderesis
,
and
in
his
unique
approach
to
the
invincibly
erroneous
conscience
.



It
is
difficult
to
know
for
certain
why
Ockham
abandoned
the
concept
of
---------------
moral
epistemology
was
Pinckaers’
assumption
that
,
because
Ockham
discarded
the
traditional
notion
of
synderesis
,
he
must
have
done
the
same
for
its
twin
concept
of
conscience
.


Pinckaers
conceded
that
moral
principles
,
even
if
rooted
in
the
divine
will
,
still
need
to
be
applied
to
particular
situations
on
Ockham’s
account
.


This
role
was
,
of
course
,
reserved
for
conscience
in
the
earlier
tradition
.


In
Ockham
,
according
to
Pinckaers
,
this
role
now
became
associated
with
practical
reason
and
prudence
(Pinckaers
1993
:
259)
.



A
closer
reading
of
the
textual
evidence
suggests
that
Ockham
very
much
made
use
of
the
traditional
concept
of
conscience
.


Indeed
,
much
of
how
he
employed
the
concept
was
consistent
with
the
tradition
,
especially
as
articulated
by
Aquinas
.


Ockham
associates
the
dictates
of
practical
reason
,
for
example
,
with
judgements
of
conscience
.


He
is
also
emphatic
in
his
belief
that
rational
agents
have
an
absolute
obligation
to
follow
their
consciences
,
which
can
be
correct
or
erroneous
(Quaestiones
variae
,
q
.


8
,
a
.


1
,
OTh
8
:
411)
.


A
conscience
is
correct
when
it
is
in
accord
with
right
reason
;
it
is
erroneous
when
it
is
not
.


Finally
,
an
erroneous
conscience
,
for
Ockham
,
as
with
Aquinas
,
is
either
in
a
state
of
vincible—voluntary
and
therefore
culpable—ignorance
,
or
in
a
state
of
invincible—or
involuntary—ignorance
.


Where
conscience
is
in
a
state
of
vincible
ignorance
,
we
must
do
our
best
to
set
it
aside
.


In
all
these
cases
Ockham
follows
the
tradition
,
with
one
exception
:
that
of
the
invincibly
erroneous
conscience
(Eardley
2013
:
94–98)
,
the
state
in
which
the
agent
finds
himself
with
the
correct
universal
principles
,
but
non-culpably
errs
with
respect
to
his
grasp
of
the
circumstances
in
---------------

In
what
sense
does
Ockham
depart
from
the
tradition
?


For
Ockham
,
the
act
of
following
an
invincibly
erroneous
conscience
is
not
merely
excusable
,
as
it
was
For
Aquinas
,
but
“virtuous
and
meritorious”
.


Consider
the
following
example
from
Ockham
.


While
walking
down
the
street
one
day
you
---------------
determine
that
,
although
it
is
theoretically
possible
that
he
could
be
fraud
,
this
seems
unlikely
.


For
Ockham
,
you
are
obliged
in
this
instance
to
follow
your
conscience
,
and
indeed
you
do
.


It
turns
out
,
however
,
that
this
apparent
homeless
person
is
in
fact
a
very
wealthy
person
who
is
impersonating
a
beggar
.


For
Ockham
,
in
following
your
conscience
,
you
are
not
merely
excused
or
absolved
of
your
error
,
but
your
(ignorant)
act
is
virtuous
and
,
indeed
,
regarded
by
God
as
meritorious
(so
long
,
---------------

Indeed
,
had
he
not
,
while
in
such
error
,
willed
to
help
that
person
,

he
would
have
performed
a
vicious
and
demeritorious
act
because
such

an
act
would
have
been
knowingly
elicited
against
conscience
and

against
non-culpable
reason
,
because
in
the
aforementioned
case
he

does
not
know
that
he
is
in
error
but
believes
that
he
possesses
right
---------------

What
is
motivating
Ockham’s
novel
suggestion
?


Even
Aquinas
admitted
that
we
have
an
obligation
to
follow
our
consciences
,
whether
right
or
erroneous
.


When
we
do
not
do
so
,
according
to
Aquinas
,
we
sin
.


Of
course
,
when
our
consciences
are
in
a
state
of
voluntary
or
vincible
ignorance
we
also
have
a
duty
to
put
aside
our
error
,
otherwise
we
sin
.


It
is
obviously
not
possible
,
however
,
to
put
error
aside
in
the
case
of
invincible
ignorance
since
such
ignorance
is
by
definition
involuntary
.


Accordingly
,
for
Aquinas
,
we
are
obliged
to
follow
such
a
conscience
.


Although
we
act
wrongly
,
in
such
cases
,
we
are
,
for
Aquinas
,
excused
on
the
grounds
that
we
could
not
have
known
better
.


To
return
to
Aquinas’s
---------------
such
an
act
might
be
considered
virtuous
,
much
less
meritorious
.


But
for
Ockham
,
if
it
is
vicious
and
therefore
punishable
not
to
follow
an
invincibly
erroneous
conscience
,
then
merely
being
excused
for
following
it
when
we
are
under
a
moral
obligation
to
do
so
would
be
an
insufficient
reward
.


Rather
,
it
should
logically
follow
that

PRAY

CATHOLICS
EVERYWHERE
TO

AMERICA

Moral
Conscience

From
the
Catechism
of
the
Catholic
Church
,
Simplified
---------------
An
Inner
Law
(1776)

Deep
within
his
conscience
,
man
discovers
a
law
which
he
must
obey
,
namely
to
do
good
and
to
avoid
evil
.


In
his
conscience
(man
'
s
most
secret
core)
he
is
alone
with
God
whose
voice
echoes
within
man
.



Conscience
-
Judge
of
Individual
Acts
(1777-1779)

Moral
conscience
urges
a
person
to
do
good
and
avoid
evil
.


It
even
judges
his
particular
choices
(past
,
present
,
and
future)
and
shows
God
'
s
authority
.


The
prudent
man
hears
God
speaking
in
his
commandments
.



By
conscience
,
the
person
'
s
reason
judges
the
morality
of
his
actions
(past
,
present
,
or
future)
.


In
this
judgment
,
man
sees
God
'
s
law
.


"Conscience
is
a
messenger
of
him
who
speaks
to
us
behind
a
veil
and
teaches
us
by
his
representatives
.


Conscience
is
the
aboriginal
Vicar
of
Christ"
(John
Cardinal
Newman)
.



Every
person
must
have
sufficient
interior
awareness
so
he
can
hear
and
follow
his
conscience
.


"Turn
inward
,
brethren
,
and
in
everything
you
do
,
see
God
as
your
witness"
(St
.


Augustine)
.



An
Upright
Conscience
Assumes
Responsibility
(1780-1782)

Human
dignity
requires
an
upright
conscience
which
knows
moral
principles
and
applies
them
in
each
circumstance
.


Truth
is
recognized
by
prudent
judgments
.


Whoever
follows
his
conscience
is
indeed
prudent
.



By
conscience
,
a
person
assumes
responsibility
.


Even
in
evil
deeds
,
conscience
remains
an
inner
witness
to
truth
that
the
choice
was
evil
.


This
true
judgment
makes
clear
that
the
person
must
seek
forgiveness
and
choose
good
in
the
future
.


"Whenever
our
hearts
condemn
us
,
we
reassure
---------------

Man
has
a
right
to
make
his
own
moral
decisions
.


He
cannot
be
forced
to
act
contrary
to
his
conscience
,
nor
be
prevented
from
acting
according
to
his
conscience
,
especially
in
religious
matters
.



Man
'
s
Duty
-
To
Have
a
Right
Conscience
(1783-1785)

The
person
has
a
duty
to
have
a
true
conscience
which
is
formed
by
reason
and
seeks
to
know
God
'
s
will
.


Only
the
educating
of
conscience
can
overcome
negative
influences
and
temptations
.



---------------
guarantees
peace
of
heart
.



The
Word
of
God
guides
this
education
.


Man
must
examine
his
conscience
before
the
cross
,
seek
the
advice
of
others
,
and
learn
the
Church
'
s
authoritative
teaching
.


---------------
Difficulties
in
Judging
(1786-1789)

Conscience
can
make
a
right
judgment
(in
accord
with
God
'
s
law
and
reason)
or
an
erroneous
judgment
(not
in
accord)
.



---------------

Although
a
person
must
always
obey
the
certain
judgments
of
his
conscience
,
he
might
be
in
ignorance
and
make
erroneous
judgments
.



Sometimes
,
the
person
is
to
blame
for
having
an
erroneous
conscience
because
he
took
no
effort
to
discover
the
truth
.


In
this
case
,
he
is
responsible
for
the
evil
he
commits
.


---------------
blameworthy
.


He
should
work
to
correct
his
errors
.



Conscience
must
be
enlightened
by
faith
so
that
persons
and
groups
will
turn
aside
from
blind
choices
.



+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Collective
consciousness
,
collective
conscience
,
or
collective
conscious
(French
:
conscience
collective)
is
the
set
of
shared
beliefs
,
ideas
,
and
moral
attitudes
which
operate
as
a
unifying
force
within
society
.

^([1])
In
general
,
it
does
not
refer
to
the
specifically
moral
conscience
,
but
to
a
shared
understanding
of
social
norms
.

^([2])

---------------

The
term
was
introduced
by
the
French
sociologist
Émile
Durkheim
in
his
The
Division
of
Labour
in
Society
in
1893
.


The
French
word
conscience
generally
means
"conscience"
,
"consciousness"
,
"awareness"
,^([6])
or
"perception"
.

^([7])
Given
the
multiplicity
of
definitions
,
translators
of
Durkheim
disagree
on
which
is
most
appropriate
,
or
whether
the
translation
should
depend
on
the
context
.


Some
prefer
to
treat
the
word

'
conscience
'

as
an
untranslatable
foreign
word
or
technical
term
,
without
its
normal
English
meaning
.

^([8])
As
for
"collective"
,
Durkheim
makes
clear
that
he
is
not
reifying
or
hypostasizing
this
concept
;
for

Émile
Durkheim
,
a
pioneering
figure
in
sociology
,
coined
the
French
term
"conscience
collective
.

"
His
idea
of
collective
consciousness
refers
to
beliefs
and
sentiments
common
to
average
members
of
society
,
forming
a
determinate
system
that
has
its
own
life
.


According
to
Durkheim
,
this
Updated

Collective
consciousness
(sometimes
collective
conscience
or
conscious)
is
a
fundamental
sociological
concept
that
refers
to
the
set
of
shared
beliefs
,
ideas
,
attitudes
,
and

that

---------------
This
is
why
we
can
form
collectives

together
to
achieve
community
and
functional
societies
.


The
collective
consciousness
,
or conscience
collective as
he
wrote
it
in
French
,
is
the
source
of
this
solidarity

This
inward
looking
and
subjective
character
of
conscience
is
also
reflected
in
the
etymological
relation
between
the
notion
of
“conscience”
and
that
of
consciousness
.


Only
after
the
17^(th)
Century
did
“consciousness”
start
to
be
used
with
a
distinct
meaning
referring
to
the
psychological
and
phenomenal
dimension
of
the
mind
,
rather
than
to
its
moral
dimension
(for
an
account
of
the
terminological
---------------
and


consciousness
of
an
internal
court
in
man
.


(Kant
1797
[1991
:

This
understanding
of
conscience
as

“establishes

obligation
in
the
individual’s
consciousness”
(Fuss

The
subjective
character

implies
that
the
motivational
force
must

knowledge
requires
discrimination

realization
in

that

Antonio
Damasio
considers
conscience
an
aspect
of
extended
consciousness
beyond
survival-related
dispositions
and
incorporating
the
search
for
truth
and
desire
to

meaning
"privity
of

or
"with-knowledge"
.


The
English
word
implies
internal
awareness
of
a
moral
standard
in
the
mind
concerning
the
quality
of
one

s
motives
,
as
well
as
a
consciousness
of
our
own
actions
.

^([84])
Thus
conscience
considered
philosophically
may
be
first
,
and
perhaps
most
commonly
,
a
largely
unexamined
"gut
feeling"

"count

;"

Arendt
also
wrote
eloquently
on
the
problem
of
languages
distinguishing
the
word
consciousness
from
conscience
.


One
reason
,
she
held
,
was
that
conscience
,
as
we
understand
it
in
moral
or
legal
matters
,
is
supposedly
always
present
within
us
,
just
like
consciousness
:
"and
this
conscience
is
also
supposed
to
tell
us
what
to
do
and
what
to
repent
;
before
it
became
the
lumen
naturale
or
Kant
'
s
practical
reason
,
it
was
the
voice
of
God
.

"^([127])

ideologies

but
as
an
aspect

,
access
to
which
is

Thinking

John
Passmore
has
argued
that
mystical
considerations
about
the
global
expansion
of
all
human
consciousness
,
should
take
into
account
that
if
as
a
species
we

superior
to
what
we

it

What
Is
Consciousness
?




Your
consciousness
refers
to
your
conscious
experiences
,
your
individual
awareness
of
your
own
internal
thoughts
,
feelings
,
memories
,
and
sensations
.



Consciousness
is
often
thought
of
as
a
stream
,
constantly
shifting
according
to
the
ebb
and
flow
of
your
thoughts
and
experiences
of
the
world
around
you
.



"Consciousness
is
generally
defined
as
awareness
of
your
thoughts
,
actions
,
feelings
,
sensations
,
perceptions
,
and
other
mental
processes
,"
explain
psychologists
Douglass
A
.


Bernstein
,
Louis
A
.


Penner
,
and
Edward
Roy
.



In
other
words
,
they
say
,
this
suggests
that
consciousness
isn
'
t
just
one
mental
process
but
rather
a
part
of
many
.


"For
example
,
memories
can
be
conscious
,
but
consciousness
is
not
just
memory
.


Perceptions
can
be
conscious
,
but
consciousness
is
not
just
perception
.

"

The
conscious
and
consciousness
can
be
difficult
to
pin
down
.


As
psychologist
and
philosopher
William
James
once
explained
,
"Its
meaning
we
know
so
long
as
no
one
asks
us
to
define
it
.

Why
consciousness
may
have
evolved
to
benefit
society
rather
than individuals

Why
did
the
experience
of
consciousness
evolve
from
our
underlying
brain
physiology
?


Despite
being
a
vibrant
area
of
neuroscience
,
current
research
on
consciousness
is
characterised
by
disagreement
and
controversy
–
with
several
rival
theories
in
contention
.



A
recent
scoping
review
of
over
1
,000
articles
identified
over
20
different
theoretical
accounts
.


Philosophers
like
David
Chalmers
argue
that
no
single
scientific
theory
can
truly
explain
consciousness
.



We
define
consciousness
as
embodied
subjective
awareness
,
including
self
awareness
.


In
a
recent
article
published
in
Interalia
(which
is
not
peer
reviewed)
,
we
argue
that
one
reason
for
this
predicament
is
the
powerful
---------------

We
are
not
alone
.


Social
scientist
Jacy
Reese
Anthis
writes
“much
of
the
debate
on
the
fundamental
nature
of
consciousness
takes
the
form
of
intuition
jousting
,
in
which
the
different
parties
each
report
their
own
strong
intuitions
and
joust
them
against
each
other”
.


---------------
because
they
are
powerfully
endorsed
by
social
and
cultural
concepts
such
as
free
will
,
human
rights
,
democracy
,
justice
and
moral
responsibility
.


All
these
concepts
assume
that
consciousness
plays
a
central
controlling
influence
.



---------------
beliefs
can
be
wrong
.


They
can
also
interfere
with
scientific
literacy
.



Intuitive
accounts
of
consciousness
ultimately
put
us
in
the
driver’s
seat
as
“captain
of
our
own
ship”
.


We
think
we
know
what
consciousness
is
and
what
it
does
from
simply
experiencing
it
.


Mental
thoughts
,
intentions
and
desires
are
seen
as
determining
and
controlling
our
---------------

The
widespread
acceptance
of
these
tacit
intuitive
accounts
helps
explain
,
in
part
,
why
the
formal
study
of
consciousness
was
relegated
to
the
margins
of
mainstream
neuroscience
until
late
20th
century
.



The
problem
for
scientific
models
of
consciousness
remains
accommodating
these
intuitive
accounts
within
a
materialist
framework
consistent
with
the
findings
of
neuroscience
.


While
there
is
no
current
scientific
---------------
Social
purpose

If
that’s
the
case
,
why
did
consciousness
,
defined
as
subjective
awareness
,
evolve
?



Consciousness
presumably
evolved
as
part
of
the
evolution
of
the
nervous
system
.


According
to
several
theories
the
key
adaptive
function
(providing
an
organism
with
survival
and
reproductive
benefits)
of
consciousness
is
to
make
volitional
movement
possible
.


And
volition
is
something
we
ultimately
associate
with
will
,
agency
and
individuality
.


It
is
therefore
easy
to
think
that
consciousness
evolved
to
benefit
us
as
individuals
.



Humans
are
a
highly
social
species
.


Esteban
De
Armas/Shuttestock

But
we
have
argued
that
consciousness
may
have
evolved
to
facilitate
key
social
adaptive
functions
.


Rather
than
helping
individuals
survive
,
it
evolved
to
help
us
broadcast
our
experienced
ideas
and
feelings
into
the
 

The
key
to
this
type
of
leadership
is
precisely
the
consciousness
of
the
act
of
leading
.


It
means
that
being
aware
is
not
just
about
realizing
it
but
also
about
being
capable
of
reflecting
on
our
actions
,
roles
,
and
---------------

A
conscious
leader
is
a
figure
that
is
increasingly
gaining
prominence
in
companies
.


Consciousness
applied
to
decision-making
within
an
organization
is
crucial
for
leading
positive
changes
.


Why
?


Because
it
allows
for
the
consideration
of
different
variables
involved
.

Consciousness
,
at

,
is
awareness
of
internal
and
external
existence
.

^([1])
However
,
its
nature
has
led
to

In

explanations
,
it

as

About

definition
of
consciousness
appear

^([19])

Scholars
are
divided
as
to
whether
Aristotle
had
a
concept
of
consciousness
.


He
does
not
use
any
single
word
or
terminology
that
is
clearly
similar
to
the
phenomenon
or
concept
defined
by
John

Victor

that
Aristotle
did
have
a
concept
more
clearly
similar

examples
were
phrases
like
inner
experience
and
personal
consciousness
:


The
first
and
foremost
concrete
fact
which
every
one
will
affirm
to

belong
to
his
inner
experience
is
the
fact
that
consciousness
of
some

sort
goes
on
.



'
States
of
mind
'

succeed
each
other
in
him
.

But

everyone
knows
what
the
terms
mean
[only]
in
a
rough
way
;
[
.

When
I

say
every

'
state
'

or

'
thought
'

is
part
of
a
personal
consciousness
,


'
personal
consciousness
'

is
one
of
the
terms
in
question
.


Its
meaning

we
know
so
long
as
no
one
asks
us
to
define
it
,
but
to
give
an

accurate
account
of
it
is
the
most
difficult
of
philosophic
tasks
.

The
only
states
of
consciousness
that
we
naturally
deal
with
are

found
in
personal

Prior
to
the
20th
century
,
philosophers
treated
the
phenomenon
of
consciousness
as
the
"inner
world
[of]
one
'
s
own
mind"
,
and
introspection
was
the
mind
"attending
to"
itself
,^([b])
an
activity
seemingly
distinct
from
that
of
perceiving
the

'
outer
world
'

and
its
---------------

doubted
.


The
outer
world
,
but
never
the
inner
world
,
has
been
denied
.



Everyone
assumes
that
we
have
direct
introspective
acquaintance
with

our
thinking
activity
as
such
,
with
our
consciousness
as
something

inward
and
contrasted
with
the
outer
objects
which
it
knows
.


Yet
I

must
confess
that
for
my
part
I
cannot
feel
sure
of
this
conclusion
.



[

It
seems
as
if
consciousness
as
an
inner
activity
were
rather
a

postulate
than
a
sensibly
given
fact
.

^([25]

)

By
the
1960s
,
for
many
philosophers
and
psychologists
who
talked
about
consciousness
,
the
word
no
longer
meant
the

'
inner
world
'

but
an
indefinite
,
large
category
called
awareness
,
as
in
the
following
example
:


It
is
difficult
for
modern
Western
man
to
grasp
that
the
Greeks
really

had
no
concept
of
consciousness
in
that
they
did
not
class
together

phenomena
as
varied
as
problem
solving
,
remembering
,
imagining
,

perceiving
,
feeling
pain
,
dreaming
,
and
acting
on
the
grounds
that
all
---------------
a
skeptical
attitude
more
than
a
definition
:


Consciousness—The
having
of
perceptions
,
thoughts
,
and
feelings
;

awareness
.


The
term
is
impossible
to
define
except
in
terms
that
are

unintelligible
without
a
grasp
of
what
consciousness
means
.


Many
fall

into
the
trap
of
equating
consciousness
with
self-consciousness—to
be

conscious
it
is
only
necessary
to
be
aware
of
the
external
world
.



Consciousness
is
a
fascinating
but
elusive
phenomenon
:
it
is

impossible
to
specify
what
it
is
,
what
it
does
,
or
why
it
has
evolved
.



Nothing
worth
reading
has
been
written
on
it
.

^([29])

Using

'
awareness
'

,
however
,
as
a
definition
or
synonym
of
consciousness
is
not
a
simple
matter
:


If
awareness
of
the
environment
.


.


.


is
the
criterion
of

consciousness
,
then
even
the
protozoans
are
conscious
.


If
awareness
of

awareness
is
required
,
then
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
great
apes
and

human
infants
are
conscious
.

^([26])
---------------
[edit]

Many
philosophers
have
argued
that
consciousness
is
a
unitary
concept
that
is
understood
by
the
majority
of
people
despite
the
difficulty
philosophers
have
had
defining
it
.

^([30])
Max
Velmans
proposed
that
the
"everyday
understanding
of
consciousness"
uncontroversially
"refers
to
experience
itself
rather
than
any
particular
thing
that
we
observe
or
experience"
and
he
added
that
consciousness
"is
[therefore]
exemplified
by
all
the
things
that
we
observe
or
experience"
,^([31]
:
4
)
whether
thoughts
,
feelings
,
or
perceptions
.


Velmans
noted
however
,
as
of
2009
,
that
there
was
a
deep
level
of
"confusion
and
internal
division"^([31])
among
experts
about
the
phenomenon
of
consciousness
,
because
researchers
lacked
"a
sufficiently
well-specified
use
of
the
term
.


.


.

to
agree
that
they
are
investigating
the
same
thing"
.

^([31]
:
3
)
He
argued
additionally
that
"pre-existing
theoretical
commitments"
to
competing
explanations
of
consciousness
might
be
a
source
of
bias
.



Within
the
"modern
consciousness
studies"
community
the
technical
phrase

'
phenomenal
consciousness
'

is
a
common
synonym
for
all
forms
of
awareness
,
or
simply

'
experience
'

,^([31]
:
4
)
without
differentiating
between
inner
and
outer
,
or
between
higher
and
lower
types
.


With
---------------
phenomenology
to
its
associated
information
processing"
in
the
brain
.

^([31]
:
10
)
This
neuroscientific
goal
is
to
find
the
"neural
correlates
of
consciousness"
(NCC)
.


One
criticism
of
this
goal
is
that
it
begins
with
a
theoretical
commitment
to
the
neurological
origin
of
all
"experienced
phenomena"
whether
inner
or
outer
.

^([c])
Also
,
the
fact
that
the
easiest

'
content
of
consciousness
'

to
be
so
analyzed
is
"the
experienced
three-dimensional
world
(the
phenomenal
world)
beyond
the
body
surface"^([31]
:
4
)
invites
another
criticism
,
that
most
consciousness
research
since
the
1990s
,
perhaps
because
of
bias
,
has
focused
on
processes
of
external
perception
.

^([33])

From
a
history
of
psychology
perspective
,
Julian
Jaynes
rejected
popular
but
"superficial
views
of
consciousness"^([2]
:
447
)
especially
those
which
equate
it
with
"that
vaguest
of
terms
,
experience"
.

^([24]
:
8
)
In
1976
he
insisted
that
if
not
for
introspection
,
which
for
decades
had
been
ignored
or
taken
for
granted
rather
than
explained
,
there
could
be
no
"conception
of
what
consciousness
is"^([24]
:
18
)
and
in
1990
,
he
reaffirmed
the
traditional
idea
of
the
phenomenon
called

'
consciousness
'

,
writing
that
"its
denotative
definition
is
,
as
it
was
for
René
Descartes
,
John
Locke
,
and
David
Hume
,
what
is
introspectable"
.

^([2]
:
450
)
Jaynes
saw
consciousness
as
an
important
but
small
part
of
human
mentality
,
and
he
asserted
:
"there
can
be
no
progress
in
the
science
of
consciousness
until 
.


.


.


what
is
introspectable
[is]
sharply
distinguished"^([2]
:

)
from
the
unconscious
processes
of
cognition
such
as
perception
,
reactive
---------------
The
cognitive
science
point
of
view—with
an
inter-disciplinary
perspective
involving
fields
such
as
psychology
,
linguistics
and
anthropology^([34])—requires
no
agreed
definition
of
"consciousness"
but
studies
the
interaction
of
many
processes
besides
perception
.


For
some
researchers
,
consciousness
is
linked
to
some
kind
of
"selfhood"
,
for
example
to
certain
pragmatic
issues
such
as
the
feeling
of
agency
and
the
effects
of
regret^([33])
and
action
on
experience
of
one
'
s
own
body
---------------

Some
have
argued
that
we
should
eliminate
the
concept
from
our
understanding
of
the
mind
,
a
position
known
as
consciousness
semanticism
.

^([38])

In
medicine
,
a
"level
of
consciousness"
terminology
is
used
to
describe
a
patient
'
s
arousal
and
responsiveness
,
which
can
be
seen
as
a
continuum
of
states
ranging
from
full
alertness
and
comprehension
,
through
disorientation
,
delirium
,
loss
of
meaningful
communication
,
and
finally
loss
of
movement
in
response
to
painful
stimuli
.

^([39])
Issues
of
practical
concern
include
how
the
level
of
consciousness
can
be
assessed
in
severely
ill
,
comatose
,
or
anesthetized
people
,
and
how
to
treat
conditions
in
which
consciousness
is
impaired
or
disrupted
.

^([40])
The
degree
or
level
of
consciousness
is
measured
by
standardized
behavior
observation
scales
such
as
the
Glasgow
Coma
Scale
.



---------------

While
historically
philosophers
have
defended
various
views
on
consciousness
,
surveys
indicate
that
physicalism
is
now
the
dominant
position
among
contemporary
philosophers
of
mind
.

^([41])
For
an
overview
of
the
field
,
approaches
often
include
both
historical
perspectives
---------------

Philosophers
differ
from
non-philosophers
in
their
intuitions
about
what
consciousness
is
.

^([42])
While
most
people
have
a
strong
intuition
for
the
existence
of
what
they
refer
to
as
consciousness
,^([30])
skeptics
argue
that
this
intuition
is
too
narrow
,
either
because
the
concept
of
consciousness
is
embedded
in
our
intuitions
,
or
because
we
all
are
illusions
.


Gilbert
Ryle
,
for
example
,
argued
that
traditional
understanding
of
consciousness
depends
on
a
Cartesian
dualist
outlook
that
improperly
distinguishes
between
mind
and
body
,
or
between
mind
and
world
.


He
proposed
that
we
speak
not
of
minds
,
bodies
,
and
the
world
,
but
of
entities
,
or
identities
,
acting
in
the
world
.


Thus
,
by
speaking
of
"consciousness"
we
end
up
leading
ourselves
by
thinking
that
there
is
any
sort
of
thing
as
consciousness
separated
from
behavioral
and
linguistic
understandings
.

^([43])

---------------
[edit]

Ned
Block
argued
that
discussions
on
consciousness
often
failed
to
properly
distinguish
phenomenal
(P-consciousness)
from
access
(A-consciousness)
,
though
these
terms
had
been
used
before
Block
.

^([44])
P-consciousness
,
according
to
Block
,
is
raw
experience
:
it
is
moving
,
colored
forms
,
sounds
,
sensations
,
emotions
and
feelings
with
our
bodies
and
responses
at
the
center
.


These
experiences
,
considered
independently
of
any
impact
on
behavior
,
are
called
qualia
.


A-consciousness
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
the
phenomenon
whereby
information
in
our
minds
is
accessible
for
verbal
report
,
reasoning
,
and
the
control
of
behavior
.


---------------
conscious
,
and
so
on
.


Although
some
philosophers
,
such
as
Daniel
Dennett
,
have
disputed
the
validity
of
this
distinction
,^([45])
others
have
broadly
accepted
it
.


David
Chalmers
has
argued
that
A-consciousness
can
in
principle
be
understood
in
mechanistic
terms
,
but
that
understanding
P-consciousness
is
much
more
challenging
:
he
calls
this
the
hard
problem
of
consciousness
.

^([46])

Some
philosophers
believe
that
Block
'
s
two
types
of
consciousness
are
not
the
end
of
the
story
.


William
Lycan
,
for
example
,
argued
in
his
book
Consciousness
and
Experience
that
at
least
eight
clearly
distinct
types
of
consciousness
can
be
identified
(organism
consciousness
;
control
consciousness
;
consciousness
of
;
state/event
consciousness
;
reportability
;
introspective
consciousness
;
subjective
consciousness
;
self-consciousness)—and
that
even
this
list
omits
several
more
obscure
forms
.

^([47])

There
is
also
debate
over
whether
or
not
A-consciousness
and
P-consciousness
always
coexist
or
if
they
can
exist
separately
.


Although
P-consciousness
without
A-consciousness
is
more
widely
accepted
,
there
have
been
some
hypothetical
examples
of
A
without
P
.


Block
,
for
instance
,
suggests
the
case
of
a
"zombie"
that
is
computationally
identical
to
a
person
but
without
any
subjectivity
.


However
,
he
remains
somewhat
skeptical
concluding
"I
don
'
t
know
whether
there
are
any
actual
cases
of
A-consciousness
without
P-consciousness
,
but
I
hope
I
have
illustrated
their
conceptual
possibility"
.

^([48])

Distinguishing
consciousness
from
its
contents

[edit]

Sam
Harris
observes
:
"At
the
level
of
your
experience
,
you
are
not
a
body
of
cells
,
organelles
,
and
atoms
;
you
are
consciousness
and
its
ever-changing
contents"
.

^([49])
Seen
in
this
way
,
consciousness
is
a
subjectively
experienced
,
ever-present
field
in
which
things
(the
contents
of
consciousness)
come
and
go
.



Christopher
Tricker
argues
that
this
field
of
consciousness
is
symbolized
by
the
mythical
bird
that
opens
the
Daoist
classic
the
Zhuangzi
.


This
bird
'
s
name
is
Of
a
Flock
(peng
鵬)
,
yet
its
back
is
countless
thousands
of
miles
across
and
its
wings
are
like
clouds
arcing
across
the
heavens
.


"Like
Of
a
Flock
,
whose
wings
arc
across
the
heavens
,
the
wings
of
your
consciousness
span
to
the
horizon
.


At
the
same
time
,
the
wings
of
every
other
being
'
s
consciousness
span
to
the
horizon
.


You
are
of
a
flock
,
one
bird
among
kin
.

Mental
processes
(such
as
consciousness)
and
physical
processes
(such
as
brain
events)
seem
to
be
correlated
,
however
the
specific
nature
of
the
connection
is
unknown
.


---------------
The
first
influential
philosopher
to
discuss
this
question
specifically
was
Descartes
,
and
the
answer
he
gave
is
known
as
mind–body
dualism
.


Descartes
proposed
that
consciousness
resides
within
an
immaterial
domain
he
called
res
cogitans
(the
realm
of
thought)
,
in
contrast
to
the
domain
of
material
things
,
which
he
called
res
extensa
(the
realm
of
---------------
solutions
can
be
divided
broadly
into
two
categories
:
dualist
solutions
that
maintain
Descartes
'
s
rigid
distinction
between
the
realm
of
consciousness
and
the
realm
of
matter
but
give
different
answers
for
how
the
two
realms
relate
to
each
other
;
and
monist
solutions
that
maintain
that
there
is
really
only
one
realm
of
being
,
of
which
consciousness
and
matter
are
both
aspects
.


Each
of
these
categories
itself
contains
numerous
variants
.


The
two
main
types
of
dualism
are
substance
dualism
---------------
Since
the
dawn
of
Newtonian
science
with
its
vision
of
simple
mechanical
principles
governing
the
entire
universe
,
some
philosophers
have
been
tempted
by
the
idea
that
consciousness
could
be
explained
in
purely
physical
terms
.


The
first
influential
writer
to
propose
such
an
idea
explicitly
was
Julien
Offray
de
La
Mettrie
,
in
his
book
Man
a
Machine
(L
'
homme
machine)
.


His
arguments
,
however
,
were
very
abstract
.

^([55])
The
most
influential
modern
physical
theories
of
consciousness
are
based
on
psychology
and
neuroscience
.


Theories
proposed
by
neuroscientists
such
as
Gerald
Edelman^([56])
and
Antonio
Damasio
,^([57])
and
by
philosophers
such
as
Daniel
Dennett
,^([58])
seek
to
explain
consciousness
in
terms
of
neural
events
occurring
within
the
brain
.


Many
other
neuroscientists
,
such
as
Christof
Koch
,^([59])
have
explored
the
neural
basis
of
consciousness
without
attempting
to
frame
all-encompassing
global
theories
.


At
the
same
time
,
computer
scientists
working
in
the
field
of
artificial
intelligence
have
pursued
the
goal
of
creating
digital
computer
programs
that
can
simulate
or
embody
consciousness
.

^([60])

A
few
theoretical
physicists
have
argued
that
classical
physics
is
intrinsically
incapable
of
explaining
the
holistic
aspects
of
consciousness
,
but
that
quantum
theory
may
provide
the
missing
ingredients
.


Several
theorists
have
therefore
proposed
quantum
mind
(QM)
theories
of
consciousness
.

^([61])
Notable
theories
falling
into
this
category
include
the
holonomic
brain
theory
of
Karl
Pribram
and
David
Bohm
,
and
the
Orch-OR
theory
formulated
by
Stuart
Hameroff
and
Roger
Penrose
.


Some
of
these
QM
theories
offer
descriptions
of
phenomenal
consciousness
,
as
well
as
QM
interpretations
of
access
consciousness
.


None
of
the
quantum
mechanical
theories
have
been
confirmed
by
experiment
.


Recent
publications
by
G

Guerreshi
,
J
.


Cia
,
S
.


Popescu
,
and
---------------
scientists
and
philosophers
consider
the
arguments
for
an
important
role
of
quantum
phenomena
to
be
unconvincing
.

^([63])
Empirical
evidence
is
against
the
notion
of
quantum
consciousness
,
an
experiment
about
wave
function
collapse
led
by
Catalina
Curceanu
in
2022
suggests
that
quantum
consciousness
,
as
suggested
by
Roger
Penrose
and
Stuart
Hameroff
,
is
highly
implausible
.

^([64])

Apart
from
the
general
question
of
the
"hard
problem"
of
consciousness
(which
is
,
roughly
speaking
,
the
question
of
how
mental
experience
can
arise
from
a
physical
basis^([65]))
,
a
more
specialized
question
is
how
---------------

Many
philosophers
consider
experience
to
be
the
essence
of
consciousness
,
and
believe
that
experience
can
only
fully
be
known
from
the
inside
,
subjectively

problem
of
other
minds
is
a
philosophical
problem
traditionally
stated
as
the
following
epistemological
question
:
---------------
principle
to
have
an
entity
that
is
physically
indistinguishable
from
a
human
being
and
behaves
like
a
human
being
in
every
way
but
nevertheless
lacks
consciousness
.

^([67])
Related
issues
have
also
been
studied
extensively
by
Greg
Littmann
of
the
University
of
Illinois
,^([68])
and
by
Colin
Allen
(a
professor
at
the
University
of
Pittsburgh)
regarding
---------------
androids
.

^([69])

The
most
commonly
given
answer
is
that
we
attribute
consciousness
to
other
people
because
we
see
that
they
resemble
us
in
appearance
and
behavior
;
we
reason
that
if
they
look
like
us
and
act
like
us
,
they
must
---------------
understand
what
they
are
saying
.

^([71])
More
broadly
,
philosophers
who
do
not
accept
the
possibility
of
zombies
generally
believe
that
consciousness
is
reflected
in
behavior
(including
verbal
behavior)
,
and
that
we
attribute
consciousness
on
the
basis
of
behavior
.


A
more
straightforward
way
of
saying
this
is
that
we
attribute
experiences
to
people
because
of
what
they
can
do
,
including
the
fact
that
they
can
---------------
The
philosopher
and
scientist
Daniel
Dennett
describes
them
as
"the
way
things
seem
to
us"
,
while
philosopher
and
cognitive
scientist
David
Chalmers
expanded
on
qualia
as
the
"hard
problem
of
consciousness"
in
the
1990s
.


When
qualia
is
experienced
,
activity
is
simulated
in
the
brain
,
and
these
processes
are
called
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
(NCCs)
.


Many
scientific
studies
have
been
done
to
attempt
to
link
particular
brain
regions
with
emotions
or
experiences
.

[edit]

For
many
decades
,
consciousness
as
a
research
topic
was
avoided
by
the
majority
of
mainstream
scientists
,
because
of
a
general
feeling
that
a
phenomenon
defined
in
subjective
terms
could
not
properly
be
studied

extensive
unconscious
ones
.

The
Science
and
Religion
Forum^([78])
1984
annual
conference
,

'
From
Artificial
Intelligence
to
Human
Consciousness
'

identified
the
nature
of
consciousness
as
a
matter
for
investigation
;
Donald
Michie
was
a
keynote
speaker
.


Starting
in
the
1980s
,
an
expanding
community
of
neuroscientists
and
psychologists
have
associated
themselves
with
a
field
called
Consciousness
Studies
,
giving
rise
to
a
stream
of
experimental
work
published
in
books
,^([79])
journals
such
as
Consciousness
and
Cognition
,
Frontiers
in
Consciousness
Research
,
Psyche
,
and
the
Journal
of
Consciousness
Studies
,
along
with
regular
conferences
organized
by
groups
such
as
the
Association
for
the
Scientific
Study
of
Consciousness^([80])
and
the
Society
for
Consciousness
Studies
.



Modern
medical
and
psychological
investigations
into
consciousness
are
based
on
psychological
experiments
(including
,
for
example
,
the
investigation
of
priming
effects
using
subliminal
stimuli)
,^([81])
and
on
case
studies
of
alterations
in
consciousness
produced
by
trauma
,
illness
,
or
drugs
.


Broadly
viewed
,
scientific
approaches
are
based
on
two
core
concepts
.


The
first
identifies
the
content
of
consciousness
with
the
experiences
that
are
reported
by
human
subjects
;
the
second
makes
use
of
the
concept
of
consciousness
that
has
been
developed
by
neurologists
and
other
medical
professionals
who
deal
with
patients
whose
behavior
is
impaired
.


In
either
case
,
the
ultimate
goals
are
to
develop
techniques
for
assessing
consciousness
objectively
in
humans
as
well
as
other
animals
,
and
to
understand
the
neural
and
psychological
mechanisms
that
underlie
it
.

ambiguous
image

Experimental
research
on
consciousness
presents
special
difficulties
,
due
to
the
lack
of
a
universally
accepted
operational
definition
.


In
the
majority
of
experiments
that
are
specifically
about
consciousness
,
the
subjects
are
human
,
and
the
criterion
used
is
verbal
report
:
in
other
words
,
subjects
are
asked
to
describe
their
experiences
,
and
their
descriptions
are
treated
as
observations
of
the
contents
of
consciousness
.

^([82])

For
example
,
subjects
who
stare
continuously
at
a
Necker
cube
usually
---------------

Verbal
report
is
widely
considered
to
be
the
most
reliable
indicator
of
consciousness
,
but
it
raises
a
number
of
issues
.

^([85])
For
one
thing
,
if
verbal
reports
are
treated
as
observations
,
akin
to
observations
in
other
branches
of
science
,
then
the
possibility
arises
that
they
may
---------------
Another
issue
with
verbal
report
as
a
criterion
is
that
it
restricts
the
field
of
study
to
humans
who
have
language
:
this
approach
cannot
be
used
to
study
consciousness
in
other
species
,
pre-linguistic
children
,
or
people
with
types
of
brain
damage
that
impair
language
.


As
a
third
issue
,
philosophers
who
dispute
the
validity
of
the
Turing
test
may
feel
that
it
is
possible
,
at
least
in
principle
,
for
verbal
report
to
be
dissociated
from
consciousness
entirely
:
a
philosophical
zombie
may
give
detailed
verbal
reports
of
awareness
in
the
absence
of
any
genuine
awareness
.

^([88])

Although
verbal
report
is
in
practice
the
"gold
standard"
for
ascribing
consciousness
,
it
is
not
the
only
possible
criterion
.

^([85])
In
medicine
,
consciousness
is
assessed
as
a
combination
of
verbal
behavior
,
arousal
,
brain
activity
,
and
purposeful
movement
.


The
last
three
of
these
can
be
used
as
indicators
of
consciousness
when
verbal
behavior
is
absent
.

^([89][90])
The
scientific
literature
regarding
the
neural
bases
of
arousal
and
purposeful
movement
is
very
extensive
.


Their
reliability
as
indicators
of
consciousness
is
disputed
,
however
,
due
to
numerous
studies
showing
that
alert
human
subjects
can
be
induced
to
behave
purposefully
in
a
variety
of
ways
in
spite
of
reporting
a
complete
lack
of
awareness
.

^([84])
Studies
related
to
the
neuroscience
of
free
will
have
also
shown
that
the
influence
consciousness
has
on
decision-making
is
not
always
straightforward
.

Schema
of
the
neural
processes
underlying
consciousness
,
from
Christof
Koch

A
major
part
of
the
scientific
literature
on
consciousness
consists
of
studies
that
examine
the
relationship
between
the
experiences
reported
by
subjects
and
the
activity
that
simultaneously
takes
place
in
their
brains—that
is
,
studies
of
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
.


The
hope
is
to
find
that
activity
in
a
particular
part
of
the
brain
,
or
a
particular
pattern
of
global
brain
activity
,
which
will
be
strongly
---------------

Another
idea
that
has
drawn
attention
for
several
decades
is
that
consciousness
is
associated
with
high-frequency
(gamma
band)
oscillations
in
brain
activity
.


This
idea
arose
from
proposals
in
the
1980s
,
by
Christof
von
der
Malsburg
and
Wolf
Singer
,
that
gamma
---------------
information
represented
in
different
parts
of
the
brain
into
a
unified
experience
.

^([98])
Rodolfo
Llinás
,
for
example
,
proposed
that
consciousness
results
from
recurrent
thalamo-cortical
resonance
where
the
specific
thalamocortical
systems
(content)
and
the
non-specific
(centromedial
thalamus)
thalamocortical
systems
(context)
interact
in
---------------

A
number
of
studies
have
shown
that
activity
in
primary
sensory
areas
of
the
brain
is
not
sufficient
to
produce
consciousness
:
it
is
possible
for
subjects
to
report
a
lack
of
awareness
even
when
areas
such
as
the
primary
visual
cortex
(V1)
show
clear
electrical
responses
to
a
---------------
Modulation
of
neural
responses
may
correlate
with
phenomenal
experiences
.


In
contrast
to
the
raw
electrical
responses
that
do
not
correlate
with
consciousness
,
the
modulation
of
these
responses
by
other
stimuli
correlates
surprisingly
well
with
an
important
aspect
of
consciousness
:
namely
with
the
phenomenal
experience
of
stimulus
intensity
(brightness
,
contrast)
.


In
the
research
group
of
Danko
Nikolić
it
has
been
shown
that
some
of
the
changes
in
the
subjectively
perceived
---------------
sleep
or
in
a
locked-in
state
than
in
those
who
are
in
deep
sleep
or
in
a
vegetative
state
,^([108])
making
it
potentially
useful
as
a
quantitative
assessment
of
consciousness
states
.



Assuming
that
not
only
humans
but
even
some
non-mammalian
species
are
conscious
,
a
number
of
evolutionary
approaches
to
the
problem
of
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
open
up
.


For
example
,
assuming
that
birds
are
conscious—a
common
assumption
among
neuroscientists
and
ethologists
due
to
the
extensive
cognitive
repertoire
of
birds—there
are
comparative
neuroanatomical
ways
to
validate
some
of
the
principal
,
currently
competing
,
mammalian
consciousness–brain
theories
.


The
rationale
for
such
a
comparative
study
is
that
the
avian
brain
deviates
structurally
from
the
mammalian
brain
.


So
how
similar
are
they
?


What
homologs
can
be
---------------
al
.

^([109])
is
that
some
of
the
major
theories
for
the
mammalian
brain^([110][111][112])
also
appear
to
be
valid
for
the
avian
brain
.


The
structures
assumed
to
be
critical
for
consciousness
in
mammalian
brains
have
homologous
counterparts
in
avian
brains
.


Thus
the
main
portions
of
the
theories
of
Crick
and
Koch
,^([110])
Edelman
and
Tononi
,^([111])
and
Cotterill
^([112])
seem
to
be
compatible
with
the
assumption
that
birds
are
conscious
.


Edelman
also
differentiates
between
what
he
calls
primary
consciousness
(which
is
a
trait
shared
by
humans
and
non-human
animals)
and
higher-order
consciousness
as
it
appears
in
humans
alone
along
with
human
language
capacity
.

^([111])
Certain
aspects
of
the
three
theories
,
however
,
seem
less
easy
to
apply
to
the
hypothesis
of
avian
consciousness
.


For
instance
,
the
suggestion
by
Crick
and
Koch
that
layer
5
neurons
of
the
mammalian
brain
have
a
special
role
,
seems
difficult
to
apply
to
the
avian
brain
,
since
the
avian
homologs
have
a
different
morphology
.


Likewise
,
the
theory
of
Eccles^([113][114])
seems
incompatible
,
since
a
structural
homolog/analogue
to
the
dendron
has
not
been
found
in
avian
brains
.


The
assumption
of
an
avian
consciousness
also
brings
the
reptilian
brain
into
focus
.


The
reason
is
the
structural
continuity
between
avian
and
reptilian
brains
,
meaning
that
the
phylogenetic
origin
of
consciousness
may
be
earlier
than
suggested
by
many
leading
neuroscientists
.

A

region

suggested
to
drive

functional
connectivity
with
two
cortical
regions
,
the
left
ventral

cortex
,
and
the

These

work

(GWT)

theory
of

proposed
by
the
cognitive
psychologist
Bernard
Baars
in
1988
.


Baars

represented

This

Integrated
information
theory
(IIT)
,
pioneered
by
neuroscientist
Giulio
Tononi
in
2004
,
postulates
that
consciousness
resides
in
the
information
being
processed
and
arises
once
the
information
reaches
a
certain
level
of
complexity
.


Additionally

IIT
is
one
of
the
only
leading
theories
of
consciousness
that
attempts
to
create
a
1
:1
mapping
between
conscious
states
and
precise
,
formal
mathematical
descriptions
of
those
mental
states
.


Proponents
of
this
model
suggest
that
it
may
provide
a
physical
grounding
for
consciousness
in
neurons
,
as
they
provide
the
mechanism
by
which
information
is
integrated
.


This
also
relates
to
the
"hard
problem
of
consciousness"
proposed
by
David
Chalmers
.

theory
remains
controversial

because
of
its
lack

Projective
consciousness
model

[edit]

In
2017
,
work
by
David
Rudrauf
and
colleagues
,
including
Karl
Friston
,
applied
the
active
inference
paradigm
to
consciousness
,
leading
to
the
projective
consciousness
model
(PCM)
,
a
model
of
how
sensory
data
is
integrated
with
priors
in
a
process
of
projective
transformation
.


The
authors
argue
that
,
while
their
model
identifies
a
key
relationship
between
computation
and
phenomenology
,
it
does
not
completely
solve
the

Claustrum
being
the
conductor
for
consciousness

[edit]
---------------

The
proposal
is
backed
by
a
study
done
in
2014
,
where
a
team
at
the
George
Washington
University
induced
unconsciousness
in
a
54-year-old
woman
suffering
from
intractable
epilepsy
by
stimulating
her
claustrum
.


The
woman
underwent
depth
electrode
implantation
and
electrical
stimulation
mapping
.


The
electrode
between
the
left
claustrum
and
anterior-dorsal
insula
was
the
one
which
induced
unconsciousness
.


Correlation
for
interactions
affecting
medial
parietal
and
posterior
frontal
channels
during
stimulation
increased
significantly
as
well
.


Their
findings
suggested
that
the
left
claustrum
or
anterior
insula
is
an
important
part
of
a
network
that
subserves
consciousness
,
and
that
disruption
of
consciousness
is
related
to
increased
EEG
signal
synchrony
within
frontal-parietal
networks
.


However

this
remains
an
isolated

hence
inconclusive
study

The
emergence
of
consciousness
during

remains
a
topic
of
ongoing
scientific
inquiry

The
survival
value
of
consciousness
is
still
a
matter
of
exploration
and
understanding

While
consciousness
appears
to
play
a
crucial
role
in
human
cognition

decision-making

and
self-awareness

its

significance

Some
argue

Thomas

for

defends
in
an

titled
"On
the
Hypothesis

an
epiphenomenalist
theory
of

,
according
to
which
consciousness
is
a
causally
inert
effect
of
neural
activity—"as
the
steam-whistle

implying
that
if
the
preservation
and
development
of
consciousness
in
the
biological
evolution
is
a
result
of
natural
selection
,
it
is
plausible
that
consciousness
has
not

been
influenced
by
neural
processes
,
but
has
had
a

itself

also
stresses
the
importance
of
the
evolutionary
emergence
of
higher-order
consciousness
in
humans
from
the
historically
older
trait
of
primary
consciousness
which
humans
share
with
non-human
animals
(see

above)
.


These
theories
of
integrative
function
present
solutions
to
two
classic
problems
associated
with
consciousness
:
differentiation
and
unity
.


They
show
how
our
conscious
experience
can
discriminate
between
a
virtually
unlimited
number
of
different
possible
scenes
and
details
(differentiation)
because
it
integrates
those
details
from
our
sensory
systems
,
while
the
integrative
nature
of
consciousness
in
this
view
easily
explains
how
our
experience
can
seem
unified
as
one
whole
despite
all
of
these
individual
parts
.


However
,
it
remains
unspecified
which
kinds
of
information
are
integrated
in
a
conscious
manner
and
which
kinds
can
be
integrated
without
consciousness
.


Nor
is
it
explained
what
specific
causal
role
conscious
integration
plays
,
nor
why
the
same
functionality
cannot
be
achieved
without
consciousness
.


Not
all
kinds
of
information
are
capable
of
being
disseminated
consciously

,
and
many
kinds
of
information
can
be
disseminated
and
combined
with
other
kinds
without
consciousness
,
as
in
intersensory
interactions
such
as
the
ventriloquism
effect
.

^([142])
Hence
it
remains
unclear
why
any
of
it
is
conscious
.


For
a
review
of
the
---------------
article
of
Ezequiel
Morsella
.

^([142])

As
noted
earlier
,
even
among
writers
who
consider
consciousness
to
be
well-defined
,
there
is
widespread
dispute
about
which
animals
other
than
humans
can
be
said
to
possess
it
.

^([143])
Edelman
has
described
this
distinction
as
that
of
humans
possessing
higher-order
consciousness
while
sharing
the
trait
of
primary
consciousness
with
non-human
animals
(see
previous
paragraph)
.


Thus
,
any
examination
of
the
evolution
of
consciousness
is
faced
with
great
difficulties
.


Nevertheless
,
some
writers
have
argued
that
consciousness
can
be
viewed
from
the
standpoint
of
evolutionary
biology
as
an
adaptation
in
the
sense
of
a
trait
that
increases
fitness
.

^([144])
In
his
article
"Evolution
of
consciousness"
,
John
Eccles
argued
that
special
anatomical
and
physical
properties
of
the
mammalian
cerebral
cortex
gave
rise
to
consciousness
("[a]

.

^([145])
Bernard
Baars
proposed
that
once
in
place
,
this
"recursive"
circuitry
may
have
provided
a
basis
for
the
subsequent
development
of
many
of
the
functions
that
consciousness
facilitates
in
higher
organisms
.

^([146])
Peter
Carruthers
has
put
forth
one
such
potential
adaptive
advantage
gained
by
conscious
creatures
by
suggesting
that
consciousness
allows
an
individual
to
make
distinctions
between
appearance
and
reality
.

^([147])
This
ability
would
enable
a
creature
to
recognize
the
likelihood
that
---------------
both
cooperative
and
devious
ends
.



Other
philosophers
,
however
,
have
suggested
that
consciousness
would
not
be
necessary
for
any
functional
advantage
in
evolutionary
processes
.

^([148][149])
No
one
has
given
a
causal
explanation
,

are
blind
to
the
difference
between

performed
by
conscious
organism
O
and
non-conscious
organism
O*
,
it
is
unclear
what
adaptive
advantage
consciousness
could
provide
.

^([150])
As
a
result
,
an
exaptive
explanation
of
consciousness
has
gained
favor
with
some
theorists
that
posit
consciousness
did
not
evolve
as
an
adaptation
but
was
an
exaptation
arising
as
a
consequence
of
other
developments
such
as
increases
in
brain
size
or
cortical
rearrangement
.

^([137])
Consciousness
in
this
sense
has
been
compared
to
the
blind
spot
in
the
retina
where
it
is
not
an
adaption
of
the
retina

but
instead
just
a
by-product
of

way

The
medical
approach
to
consciousness
is
scientifically
oriented
.


It
derives
from
a
need
to
treat
people
whose
brain
function
has
been
impaired
as
a
result
of
disease
,
brain
damage
,
toxins
,
or
drugs
.


In
medicine
,
conceptual
distinctions
are
considered
useful
to
the
degree
that
they
can
help
to
guide
treatments
.


The
medical
approach
focuses
mostly
on
the
amount
of
consciousness
a
person
has
:
in
medicine
,
consciousness
is
assessed
as
a
"level"
ranging
from
coma
and
brain
death
at
the
low
end
,
to
full
alertness
and
purposeful
responsiveness
at
the
high
end
.

^([163])

Consciousness
is
of
concern
to
patients
and
physicians
,
especially
neurologists
and
anesthesiologists
.


Patients
may
have
disorders
of
consciousness
or
may
need
to
be
anesthetized
for
a
surgical
procedure
.


Physicians
may
perform
consciousness-related
interventions
such
as
instructing
the
patient
to
sleep
,
administering
general
anesthesia
,
or
inducing
medical
coma
.

Also
,
bioethicists
may
be
concerned
with
the
ethical
implications
of
consciousness
in
medical
cases
of
patients
such
as
the
Karen
Ann
Quinlan
case

while
neuroscientists
may
study
patients
with
impaired
consciousness

gaining
information
about
how
the

In
medicine
,
consciousness
is
examined
using
a
set
of
procedures
known
as
neuropsychological
assessment

There
are
two
commonly
used
methods
for
assessing
the
level

consciousness
of
a
patient
:

negative
result

nothing

For
example
,
absence
of
philosophical
judgments
may
be
caused
by
lack
of

not
by
absence

Stream
of
consciousness
(psychology)

William
James
is
usually
credited
with
popularizing
the
idea
that
human
consciousness
flows
like
a
stream
,
in
his
Principles
of
Psychology
of
1890
.

A
similar
concept
appears
in
Buddhist
philosophy
,
expressed
by
the
Sanskrit
term
Citta-saṃtāna
,
which
is
usually
translated
as
mindstream
or
"mental
continuum"
.


Buddhist
teachings
describe
that
consciousness
manifests
moment
to
moment
as
sense
impressions
and
mental
phenomena
that
are
continuously
changing
.

laws

and

The
purpose
of
the
Buddhist
practice
of
mindfulness
is
to
understand
the
inherent
nature
of
the
consciousness
and
its
characteristics
.

In
the
West
,
the
primary
impact
of
the
idea
has
been
on
literature
rather
than
science
:
"stream
of
consciousness
as
a
narrative
mode"
means
writing
in
a
way
that
attempts
to
portray
the
moment-to-moment
thoughts
and
experiences
of
a
character
.

technique

consciousness

To
most
philosophers
,
the
word
"consciousness"
connotes
the
relationship
between
the
mind
and
the
world
.

^([citation

To
writers
on
spiritual
or
religious
topics
,
it
frequently
connotes
the
relationship

The
Canadian
psychiatrist
Richard
Maurice
Bucke
,
author
of
the
1901
book
Cosmic
Consciousness
:
A
Study
in
the
Evolution
of
the
Human
Mind
,
distinguished
between
three
types
of
consciousness
:

'
Simple
Consciousness
'

,
awareness
of
the
body
,
possessed
by
many
animals
;

'
Self
Consciousness
'

,
awareness
of
being
aware
,
possessed
only
by
humans
;
and

'
Cosmic
Consciousness
'

,
awareness
of
the
life
and
order
of
the
universe
,
possessed
only
by
humans
who
have
attained
"intellectual
enlightenment
or
illumination"
.

^([205][third-party

Another
thorough
account
of
the
spiritual
approach
is
Ken
Wilber
'
s
1977
book
The
Spectrum
of
Consciousness
,
a
comparison
of
western
and
eastern
ways
of
thinking
about
the
mind
.


Wilber
described
consciousness
as
a
spectrum
with
ordinary
awareness
at
one
end
,
and
more
profound
types
of
awareness
at
higher
levels
.

Other
examples

the
various
levels
of
spiritual
consciousness
presented

Saran
Satsangi

Hameroff

Perhaps
no
aspect
of
mind
is
more
familiar
or
more
puzzling
than
consciousness
and
our
conscious
experience
of
self
and
world
.


The
problem
of
consciousness
is
arguably
the
central
issue
in
current
theorizing
about
the
mind
.


Despite
the
lack
of
any
agreed
upon
theory
of
consciousness
,
there
is
a
widespread
,
if
less
than
universal
,
consensus
that
an
adequate
account
of
mind
requires
a
clear
understanding
of
it
and
its
place
in
nature
.


We
need
to
understand
both
what
consciousness
is
and
how
it
relates
to
other
,
nonconscious
,
aspects
of
reality
.

Reflexive
theories
---------------
for
as
long
as
there
have
been
humans
.


Neolithic
burial
practices
appear
to
express
spiritual
beliefs
and
provide
early
evidence
for
at
least
minimally
reflective
thought
about
the
nature
of
human
consciousness
(Pearson
1999
,
Clark
and
Riel-Salvatore
2001)
.


Preliterate
cultures
have
similarly
been
found
invariably
to
embrace
some
form
of
spiritual
or
at
---------------
nature
of
conscious
awareness
.



Nonetheless
,
some
have
argued
that
consciousness
as
we
know
it
today
is
a
relatively
recent
historical
development
that
arose
sometime
after
the
Homeric
era
(Jaynes
1974)
.


According
to
this
view
,
earlier
humans
---------------
in
the
ways
we
do
today
.


Others
have
claimed
that
even
during
the
classical
period
,
there
was
no
word
of
ancient
Greek
that
corresponds
to
“consciousness”
(Wilkes
1984
,
1988
,
1995)
.


Though
the
ancients
had
much
to
say
about
mental
matters
,
it
is
less
clear
whether
they
had
any
specific
concepts
or
concerns
for
what
we
now
think
of
as
consciousness
.



Although
the
words
“conscious”
and
“conscience”
are
used
quite
---------------

By
the
beginning
of
the
early
modern
era
in
the
seventeenth
century
,
consciousness
had
come
full
center
in
thinking
about
the
mind
.


Indeed
from
the
mid-17th
through
the
late
19th
century
,
consciousness
was
widely
regarded
as
essential
or
definitive
of
the
mental
.


René
Descartes
defined
the
very
notion
of
thought
(pensée)
in
terms
of
reflexive
consciousness
or
self-awareness
.


In
the
Principles
of
Philosophy
(1640)
he
wrote
,

---------------

Locke
explicitly
forswore
making
any
hypothesis
about
the
substantial
basis
of
consciousness
and
its
relation
to
matter
,
but
he
clearly
regarded
it
as
essential
to
thought
as
well
as
to
personal
identity
.



---------------
mathematical
work
on
differentiation
and
integration
,
offered
a
theory
of
mind
in
the
Discourse
on
Metaphysics
(1686)
that
allowed
for
infinitely
many
degrees
of
consciousness
and
perhaps
even
for
some
thoughts
that
were
unconscious
,
the
so
called
“petites
perceptions”
.


Leibniz
was
the
first
to
distinguish
explicitly
between
perception
and
apperception
,
i
.

e
.


,
roughly
between
awareness
and
self-awareness
.


In
the
Monadology
(1720)
he
also
offered
his
famous
analogy
of
the
mill
to
express
his
belief
that
consciousness
could
not
arise
from
mere
matter
.


He
asked
his
reader
to
imagine
someone
walking
through
an
expanded
brain
as
one
would
walk
through
a
mill
and
observing
all
its
mechanical
---------------
Despite
Leibniz
'
s
recognition
of
the
possibility
of
unconscious
thought
,
for
most
of
the
next
two
centuries
the
domains
of
thought
and
consciousness
were
regarded
as
more
or
less
the
same
.


Associationist
psychology
,
whether
pursued
by
Locke
or
later
in
the
eighteenth
century
by
David
Hume
(1739)
or
in
the
nineteenth
by
James
Mill
(1829)
,
aimed
to
---------------
The
purely
associationist
approach
was
critiqued
in
the
late
eighteenth
century
by
Immanuel
Kant
(1787)
,
who
argued
that
an
adequate
account
of
experience
and
phenomenal
consciousness
required
a
far
richer
structure
of
mental
and
intentional
organization
.


Phenomenal
consciousness
according
to
Kant
could
not
be
a
mere
succession
of
associated
ideas
,
but
at
a
minimum
had
to
be
the
experience
of
a
conscious
self
situated
---------------
study
of
phenomenology
through
the
work
of
Edmund
Husserl
(1913
,
1929)
,
Martin
Heidegger
(1927)
,
Maurice
Merleau-Ponty
(1945)
and
others
who
expanded
the
study
of
consciousness
into
the
realm
of
the
social
,
the
bodily
and
the
interpersonal
.



At
the
outset
of
modern
scientific
psychology
in
the
mid-nineteenth
century
,
the
mind
was
still
largely
equated
with
consciousness
,
and
introspective
methods
dominated
the
field
as
in
the
work
of
Wilhelm
Wundt
(1897)
,
Hermann
von
Helmholtz
(1897)
,
William
James
(1890)
and
Alfred
Titchener
(1901)
.


However
,
the
relation
of
consciousness
to
brain
remained
very
much
a
mystery
as
expressed
in
T
.


H
.


Huxley
'
s
famous
remark
,


How
it
is
that
anything
so
remarkable
as
a
state
of
consciousness

comes
about
as
a
result
of
irritating
nervous
tissue
,
is
just
as

unaccountable
as
the
appearance
of
the
Djin
,
when
Aladdin
rubbed
his

lamp
(1866)
.



The
early
twentieth
century
saw
the
eclipse
of
consciousness
from
scientific
psychology
,
especially
in
the
United
States
with
the
rise
of
behaviorism
(Watson
1924
,
Skinner
1953)
though
movements
such
as
Gestalt
---------------
(Neisser
1965
,
Gardiner
1985)
.


However
,
despite
the
renewed
emphasis
on
explaining
cognitive
capacities
such
as
memory
,
perception
and
language
comprehension
,
consciousness
remained
a
largely
neglected
topic
for
several
further
decades
.



In
the
1980s
and
90s
there
was
a
major
resurgence
of
scientific
and
philosophical
research
into
the
nature
and
basis
of
consciousness
(Baars
1988
,
Dennett
1991
,
Penrose
1989
,
1994
,
Crick
1994
,
Lycan
1987
,
1996
,
Chalmers
1996)
.


Once
consciousness
was
back
under
discussion
,
there
was
a
rapid
proliferation
of
research
with
a
flood
of
books
and
articles
,
as
well
as
the
introduction
of
specialty
journals
(The
Journal
of
Consciousness
Studies
,
Consciousness
and
Cognition
,
Psyche)
,
professional
societies
(Association
for
the
Scientific
Study
of
Consciousness—ASSC)
and
annual
conferences
devoted
exclusively
to
its
investigation
(“The
Science
of
Consciousness”)
.

Concepts
of
Consciousness

The
words
“conscious”
and
“consciousness”
are
umbrella
terms
that
cover
a
wide
variety
of
mental
phenomena
.


Both
are
used
with
a
diversity
of
meanings
,
and
the
adjective
“conscious”
is
heterogeneous
in
its
range
,
being
applied
both
to
whole
organisms—creature
consciousness—and
to
particular
mental
states
and
processes—state
consciousness
(Rosenthal
1986
,
Gennaro
1995
,
Carruthers
2000)
.

1
Creature
Consciousness

An
animal
,
person
or
other
cognitive
system
may
be
regarded
as
conscious
---------------
hypnotized
or
in
a
fugue
state
?



Self-consciousness
.


A
third
and
yet
more
demanding
sense
might
define
conscious
creatures
as
those
that
are
not
only
aware
but
also
aware
that
they
are
aware
,
thus
treating
creature
consciousness
as
a
form
of
self-consciousness
(Carruthers
2000)
.


The
self-awareness
requirement
might
get
interpreted
in
a
variety
of
ways
,
and
which
creatures
would
qualify
as
conscious
in
the
relevant
sense
will
vary
accordingly
.


If
it
---------------
world
through
its
echo-locatory
senses
,
even
though
we
humans
from
our
human
point
of
view
can
not
emphatically
understand
what
such
a
mode
of
consciousness
is
like
from
the
bat
'
s
own
point
of
view
.



Subject
of
conscious
states
.


A
fifth
alternative
would
be
to
define
the
---------------
upon
the
particular
account
one
gives
of
conscious
states
(section
2
.

2)
.



Transitive
Consciousness
.


In
addition
to
describing
creatures
as
conscious
in
these
various
senses
,
there
are
also
related
senses
in
which
creatures
are
described
as
being
conscious
of
various
things
.


The
distinction
is
sometimes
marked
as
that
between
transitive
and
intransitive
notions
of
consciousness
,
with
the
former
involving
some
object
at
which
consciousness
is
directed
(Rosenthal
1986)
.



2
.

2
State
consciousness

The
notion
of
a
conscious
mental
state
also
has
a
variety
of
distinct
---------------

Phenomenal
states
.


Such
qualia
are
sometimes
referred
to
as
phenomenal
properties
and
the
associated
sort
of
consciousness
as
phenomenal
consciousness
,
but
the
latter
term
is
perhaps
more
properly
applied
to
the
overall
structure
of
experience
and
involves
far
more
than
sensory
qualia
.


The
phenomenal
structure
of
consciousness
also
encompasses
much
of
the
spatial
,
temporal
and
conceptual
organization
of
our
experience
of
the
world
and
of
ourselves
as
agents
in
it
(see
section
4
.

3)
.


It
is
therefore
probably
best
,
at
least
initially
,
to
distinguish
the
concept
of
phenomenal
consciousness
from
that
of
qualitative
consciousness
,
though
they
no
doubt
overlap
.



What-it-is-like
states
.


Consciousness
in
both
those
senses
links
up
as
well
with
Thomas
Nagel
'
s
(1974)
notion
of
a
conscious
creature
,
insofar
as
one
might
count
a
mental
state
as
conscious
in
the
“what
it
is
like”
---------------
or
qualitative
state
.



Access
consciousness
.


States
might
be
conscious
in
a
seemingly
quite
different
access
sense
,
which
has
more
to
do
with
intra-mental
relations
.


In
this
respect
,
a
state
'
s
being
conscious
is
a
matter
of
its
availability
to
interact
with
other
states
and
of
the
access
that
one
has
to
its
content
.


In
this
more
functional
sense
,
which
corresponds
to
what
Ned
Block
(1995)
calls
access
consciousness
,
a
visual
state
'
s
being
conscious
is
not
so
much
a
matter
of
whether
or
not
it
has
a
qualitative
“what
it
'
s
likeness”
,
but
of
whether
or
not
it
and
the
visual
---------------
qualitative
or
phenomenal
feel
in
the
Nagel
sense
.



Narrative
consciousness
.


States
might
also
be
regarded
as
conscious
in
a
narrative
sense
that
appeals
to
the
notion
of
the
“stream
of
consciousness”
,
regarded
as
an
ongoing
more
or
less
serial
narrative
of
episodes
from
the
perspective
of
an
actual
or
merely
virtual
self
.


The
idea
would
be
to
equate
the
person
'
s
conscious
mental
states
with
those
---------------
independently
specified
,
they
are
obviously
not
without
potential
links
,
nor
do
they
exhaust
the
realm
of
possible
options
.


Drawing
connections
,
one
might
argue
that
states
appear
in
the
stream
of
consciousness
only
in
so
far
as
we
are
aware
of
them
,
and
thus
forge
a
bond
between
the
first
meta-mental
notion
of
a
conscious
state
and
the
stream
or
---------------
conscious
mental
states
.

3
Consciousness
as
an
entity

The
noun
“consciousness”
has
an
equally
diverse
range
of
meanings
that
largely
parallel
those
of
the
adjective
“conscious”
.


Distinctions
can
be
drawn
between
creature
and
state
consciousness
as
well
as
among
the
varieties
of
each
.


One
can
refer
specifically
to
phenomenal
consciousness
,
access
consciousness
,
reflexive
or
meta-mental
consciousness
,
and
narrative
consciousness
among
other
varieties
.



Here
consciousness
itself
is
not
typically
treated
as
a
substantive
entity
but
merely
the
abstract
reification
of
whatever
property
or
aspect
is
attributed
by
the
relevant
use
of
the
adjective
“conscious”
.


Access
consciousness
is
just
the
property
of
having
the
required
sort
of
internal
access
relations
,
and
qualitative
consciousness
is
simply
the
property
that
is
attributed
when
“conscious”
is
applied
in
the
qualitative
sense
to
mental
states
.


How
much
this
commits
one
to
the
ontological
status
of
consciousness
per
se
will
depend
on
how
much
of
a
Platonist
one
is
about
universals
in
general
.


(See
the
entry
on
the
medieval
problem
of
universals
.

)
It
need
not
commit
one
to
consciousness
as
a
distinct
entity
any
more
than
one
'
s
use
of
“square”
,
“red”
or
“gentle”
commits
one
to
the
existence
of
squareness
,
redness
or
---------------

Though
it
is
not
the
norm
,
one
could
nonetheless
take
a
more
robustly
realist
view
of
consciousness
as
a
component
of
reality
.


That
is
one
could
think
of
consciousness
as
more
on
a
par
with
electromagnetic
fields
than
with
life
.



---------------
relations
among
particles
.



Similarly
one
could
regard
“consciousness”
as
referring
to
a
component
or
aspect
of
reality
that
manifests
itself
in
conscious
states
and
creatures
but
is
more
than
merely
the
abstract
nominalization
of
the
---------------
logical
space
of
options
.



There
are
thus
many
concepts
of
consciousness
,
and
both
“conscious”
and
“consciousness”
are
used
in
a
wide
range
of
ways
with
no
privileged
or
canonical
meaning
.


However
,
this
may
be
less
of
an
embarrassment
than
an
embarrassment
of
riches
.


Consciousness
is
a
complex
feature
of
the
world
,
and
understanding
it
will
require
a
diversity
of
conceptual
tools
for
dealing
with
its
many
differing
aspects
.


Conceptual
plurality
is
thus
just
what
one
would
hope
for
.


As
long
as
one
avoids
confusion
by
being
clear
about
one
'
s
meanings
,
there
is
great
value
in
having
a
variety
of
concepts
by
which
we
can
access
and
grasp
consciousness
in
all
its
rich
complexity
.


However
,
one
should
not
assume
that
conceptual
plurality
implies
referential
divergence
.


Our
multiple
concepts
of
consciousness
may
in
fact
pick
out
varying
aspects
of
a
single
unified
underlying
mental
phenomenon
.


Whether
and
to
what
extent
they
do
so
remains
an
open
question
.

Problems
of
Consciousness

The
task
of
understanding
consciousness
is
an
equally
diverse
project
.


Not
only
do
many
different
aspects
of
mind
count
as
conscious
in
some
sense
,
each
is
also
open
to
various
respects
in
which
it
might
be
explained
or
modeled
.


Understanding
consciousness
involves
a
multiplicity
not
only
of
explananda
but
also
of
questions
that
they
pose
and
the
sorts
of
answers
they
require
.


At
the
risk
of
oversimplifying
,
---------------
What
,
How
,
and
Why
questions
:

-
The
Descriptive
Question
:
What
is
consciousness
?


What
are
its

principal
features
?


And
by
what
means
can
they
be
best
discovered
,

described
and
modeled
?


-
The
Explanatory
Question
:
How
does
consciousness
of
the
relevant

sort
come
to
exist
?


Is
it
a
primitive
aspect
of
reality
,
and
if
not

how
does
(or
could)
consciousness
in
the
relevant
respect
arise
from

or
be
caused
by
nonconscious
entities
or
processes
?


-
The
Functional
Question
:
Why
does
consciousness
of
the
relevant
sort

exist
?


Does
it
have
a
function
,
and
if
so
what
is
it
?


Does
it
act

causally
and
if
so
with
what
sorts
of
effects
?


Does
it
make
a
---------------

The
three
questions
focus
respectively
on
describing
the
features
of
consciousness
,
explaining
its
underlying
basis
or
cause
,
and
explicating
its
role
or
value
.


The
divisions
among
the
three
are
of
course
somewhat
artificial
,
and
in
practice
the
answers
one
gives
to
each
will
depend
in
part
on
what
one
says
about
the
others
.


One
can
not
,
for
example
,
adequately
answer
the
what
question
and
describe
the
main
features
of
consciousness
without
addressing
the
why
issue
of
its
functional
role
within
systems
whose
operations
it
affects
.


Nor
could
one
explain
how
the
relevant
sort
of
consciousness
might
arise
from
nonconscious
processes
unless
one
had
a
clear
account
of
just
what
features
had
to
be
caused
or
realized
to
count
as
producing
it
.


Those
caveats
---------------
structure
for
articulating
the
overall
explanatory
project
and
for
assessing
the
adequacy
of
particular
theories
or
models
of
consciousness
.

The
descriptive
question
:
What
are
the
features
of
consciousness
?



The
What
question
asks
us
to
describe
and
model
the
principal
features
of
consciousness
,
but
just
which
features
are
relevant
will
vary
with
the
sort
of
consciousness
we
aim
to
capture
.


The
main
properties
of
access
consciousness
may
be
quite
unlike
those
of
qualitative
or
phenomenal
consciousness
,
and
those
of
reflexive
consciousness
or
narrative
consciousness
may
differ
from
both
.


However
,
by
building
up
detailed
theories
of
each
type
,
we
may
hope
to
find
important
links
between
them
and
perhaps
even
to
discover
that
they
coincide
in
at
least
---------------
The
general
descriptive
project
will
require
a
variety
of
investigational
methods
(Flanagan
1992)
.


Though
one
might
naively
regard
the
facts
of
consciousness
as
too
self-evident
to
require
any
systematic
methods
of
gathering
data
,
the
epistemic
task
is
in
reality
far
from
trivial
(Husserl
1913)
.


---------------
The
need
for
third-person
empirical
data
gathered
by
external
observers
is
perhaps
most
obvious
with
regard
to
the
more
clearly
functional
types
of
consciousness
such
as
access
consciousness
,
but
it
is
required
even
with
regard
to
phenomenal
and
qualitative
consciousness
.


For
example
,
deficit
studies
that
correlate
various
neural
and
functional
sites
of
damage
with
abnormalities
of
conscious
experience
can
make
us
aware
of
---------------
introspection
(Libet
1985
,
Wegner
2002)
.


Nor
are
the
facts
gathered
by
these
third
person
methods
merely
about
the
causes
or
bases
of
consciousness
;
they
often
concern
the
very
structure
of
phenomenal
consciousness
itself
.


First-person
,
third-person
and
perhaps
even
second-person
(Varela
1995)
interactive
methods
will
all
be
needed
to
collect
the
requisite
evidence
.



Using
all
these
sources
of
data
,
we
will
hopefully
be
able
to
construct
detailed
descriptive
models
of
the
various
sorts
of
consciousness
.


Though
the
specific
features
of
most
importance
may
vary
among
the
different
types
,
our
overall
descriptive
project
will
need
to
address
at
least
the
following
seven
general
aspects
of
consciousness
(sections
4
.

2–4
.

.



---------------
responds
in
apt
ways
to
its
world
but
lacks
such
qualia
,
then
it
might
count
as
conscious
at
best
in
a
loose
and
less
than
literal
sense
.


Or
so
at
least
it
would
seem
to
those
who
take
qualitative
consciousness
in
the
“what
it
is
like”
sense
to
be
philosophically
and
scientifically
central
(Nagel
1974
,
Chalmers
1996)
.


---------------
structure
as
involving
a
special
kind
of
intentional
and
representational
organization
and
content
,
the
kind
distinctively
associated
with
consciousness
(Siewert
1998)
.


(See
the
entry
on
representational
theories
of
consciousness
.

)

Answering
the
What
question
requires
a
careful
account
of
the
coherent
---------------

Subjectivity
is
another
notion
sometimes
equated
with
the
qualitative
or
the
phenomenal
aspects
of
consciousness
in
the
literature
,
but
again
there
are
good
reason
to
recognize
it
,
at
least
in
some
of
its
forms
,
as
a
distinct
feature
of
consciousness—related
to
the
qualitative
and
the
phenomenal
but
different
from
each
.


In
particular
,
the
epistemic
form
of
subjectivity
concerns
apparent
limits
on
the
knowability
or
even
the
---------------
Whether
facts
about
experience
are
indeed
epistemically
limited
in
this
way
is
open
to
debate
(Lycan
1996)
,
but
the
claim
that
understanding
consciousness
requires
special
forms
of
knowing
and
access
from
the
inside
point
of
view
is
intuitively
plausible
and
has
a
long
history
(Locke
1688)
.


Thus
any
adequate
answer
to
the
What
question
must
address
the
epistemic
status
of
consciousness
,
both
our
abilities
to
understand
it
and
their
limits
(Papineau
2002
,
Chalmers
2003)
.

the

on
self-knowledge

5
Self-perspectival
organization

The
perspectival
structure
of
consciousness
is
one
aspect
of
its
overall
phenomenal
organization
,
but
it
is
important
enough
to
merit
discussion
in
its
own
right
.


Insofar
as
the
key
perspective
is
that
of
the
---------------
constitute
a
unified
and
coherent
self
,
and
they
likely
differ
accordingly
in
the
sort
or
degree
of
perspectival
focus
they
embody
in
their
respective
forms
of
experience
(Lorenz
1977)
.


Consciousness
may
not
require
a
distinct
or
substantial
self
of
the
traditional
Cartesian
sort
,
but
at
least
some
degree
of
perspectivally
self-like
organization
---------------
Unity
is
closely
linked
with
the
self-perspective
,
but
it
merits
specific
mention
on
its
own
as
a
key
aspect
of
the
organization
of
consciousness
.


Conscious
systems
and
conscious
mental
states
both
involve
many
diverse
forms
of
unity
.


Some
are
causal
unities
associated
with
the
integration
of
action
and
control
into
a
unified
focus
of
---------------
experience
can
have
the
content
that
it
does
only
because
it
resides
within
that
larger
unified
structure
of
representation
.


(See
the
entry
on
unity
of
consciousness
.

)

Particular
attention
has
been
paid
recently
to
the
notion
of
phenomenal
---------------
and
dispositions
to
have
conscious
states
can
be
genuinely
intentional
,
but
most
theorists
regard
intentionality
as
extending
widely
into
the
unconscious
domain
.


(See
the
entry
on
consciousness
and
intentionality
.

)

One
potentially
important
dimension
of
difference
concerns
so
called
transparency
,
which
is
an
important
feature
of
consciousness
in
two
interrelated
metaphoric
senses
,
each
of
which
has
an
intentional
,
an
experiential
and
a
functional
aspect
.


---------------
green
grass
of
which
I
am
aware
not
of
any
green
property
of
my
visual
experience
.


(See
the
entry
on
representational
theories
of
consciousness
.

)
Moore
himself
believed
we
could
become
aware
of
those
latter
qualities
with
effort
and
redirection
of
attention
,
though
some
contemporary
transparency
advocates
deny
it
(Harman
1990
,
Tye
1995
,
Kind
---------------
to
‘think
right
through’
them
to
what
they
mean
or
represent
.


Transparency
in
this
semantic
sense
may
correspond
at
least
partly
with
what
John
Searle
calls
the
“intrinsic
intentionality”
of
consciousness
(Searle
1992)
.



---------------
to
accommodate
the
former
notion
within
a
more
externalist
account
of
content
and
meaning
.


Both
semantic
and
sensory
transparency
obviously
concern
the
representational
or
intentional
aspects
of
consciousness
,
but
they
are
also
experiential
aspects
of
our
conscious
life
.


They
are
part
of
what
it
'
s
like
or
how
it
feels
phenomenally
to
be
conscious
.

Dynamic
flow

The
dynamics
of
consciousness
are
evident
in
the
coherent
order
of
its
ever
changing
process
of
flow
and
self-transformation
,
what
William
James
(1890)
called
the
“stream
of
consciousness
.

”
Some
temporal
sequences
of
experience
are
generated
by
purely
internal
factors
as
when
one
thinks
through
a
puzzle
,
and
others
depend
in
part
upon
external
causes
as
when
one
chases
a
fly
ball
,
but
even
the
latter
sequences
are
shaped
in
large
part
by
how
consciousness
transforms
itself
.



Whether
partly
in
response
to
outer
influences
or
entirely
from
within
,
---------------
those
that
preceded
it
,
constrained
and
enabled
by
the
global
structure
of
links
and
limits
embodied
in
its
underlying
prior
organization
(Husserl
1913)
.


In
that
respect
,
consciousness
is
an
autopoietic
system
,
i
.

e
.


,
a
self-creating
and
self-organizing
system
(Varela
and
Maturana
1980)
.


---------------
intentional
properties
and
interconnected
contents
(Van
Gulick
2000)
.



Consciousness
is
a
dynamic
process
,
and
thus
an
adequate
descriptive
answer
to
the
What
question
must
deal
with
more
than
just
its
static
or
momentary
properties
.


In
particular
,
it
must
give
some
account
of
the
temporal
dynamics
of
consciousness
and
the
ways
in
which
its
self-transforming
flow
reflects
both
its
intentional
coherence
and
the
semantic
self-understanding
embodied
in
the
organized
controls
through
---------------
systems
engaged
with
their
worlds
.



A
comprehensive
descriptive
account
of
consciousness
would
need
to
deal
with
more
than
just
these
seven
features
,
but
having
a
clear
account
of
each
of
them
would
take
us
a
long
way
toward
answering
the
“What
is
consciousness
?

”
question
.



5
.


The
explanatory
question
:
How
can
consciousness
exist
?



The
How
question
focuses
on
explanation
rather
than
description
.


It
asks
us
to
explain
the
basic
status
of
consciousness
and
its
place
in
nature
.


Is
it
a
fundamental
feature
of
reality
in
its
own
right
,
or
does
its
existence
depend
upon
other
nonconscious
items
,
be
they
physical
,
biological
,
neural
or
computational
?


And
if
the
latter
,
can
we
explain
or
understand
how
the
relevant
nonconscious
items
could
cause
or
realize
consciousness
?


Put
simply
,
can
we
explain
how
to
make
something
conscious
out
of
things
that
are
not
conscious
?



---------------
The
How
question
is
not
a
single
question
,
but
rather
a
general
family
of
more
specific
questions
(Van
Gulick
1995)
.


They
all
concern
the
possibility
of
explaining
some
sort
or
aspect
of
consciousness
,
but
they
vary
in
their
particular
explananda
,
the
restrictions
on
their
explanans
,
and
their
criteria
for
successful
explanation
.


For
example
,
one
might
ask
whether
we
can
explain
access
consciousness
computationally
by
mimicking
the
requisite
access
relations
in
a
computational
model
.


Or
one
might
be
concerned
instead
with
whether
the
---------------

Explananda
.


Possible
explananda
would
include
the
various
sorts
of
state
and
creature
consciousness
distinguished
above
,
as
well
as
the
seven
features
of
consciousness
listed
in
response
to
the
What
question
.


Those
two
types
of
explananda
overlap
and
intersect
.


We
might
for
example
aim
to
explain
the
dynamic
aspect
either
of
phenomenal
or
of
access
consciousness
.


Or
we
could
try
to
explain
the
subjectivity
of
either
qualitative
or
meta-mental
consciousness
.


Not
every
feature
applies
to
every
sort
of
consciousness
,
but
all
apply
to
several
.


How
one
explains
a
given
feature
in
relation
to
one
sort
of
consciousness
may
not
correspond
with
what
is
needed
to
explain
it
relative
to
another
.



Explanans
.


The
range
of
possible
explanans
is
also
diverse
.


In
perhaps
its
broadest
form
,
the
How
question
asks
how
consciousness
of
the
relevant
sort
could
be
caused
or
realized
by
nonconscious
items
,
but
we
can
generate
a
wealth
of
more
specific
questions
by
further
restricting
the
range
of
the
relevant
explanans
.


One
might
seek
to
explain
how
a
given
feature
of
consciousness
is
caused
or
realized
by
underlying
neural
processes
,
biological
structures
,
physical
mechanisms
,
functional
or
teleofunctional
relations
,
computational
organization
,
or
even
by
---------------
vary
accordingly
.


In
general
the
more
limited
and
elementary
the
range
of
the
explanans
,
the
more
difficult
the
problem
of
explaining
how
could
it
suffice
to
produce
consciousness
(Van
Gulick
1995)
.



Criteria
of
explanation
.


The
third
key
parameter
is
how
one
defines
the
---------------
explanandum
be
a
priori
deducible
from
the
explanans
,
although
it
is
controversial
whether
this
is
either
a
necessary
or
a
sufficient
criterion
for
explaining
consciousness
(Jackson
1993)
.


Its
sufficiency
will
depend
in
part
on
the
nature
of
the
premises
from
which
the
deduction
proceeds
.


As
a
matter
of
logic
,
one
will
need
some
bridge
principles
to
connect
propositions
or
sentences
about
consciousness
with
those
that
do
not
mention
it
.


If
one
'
s
premises
concern
physical
or
neural
facts
,
then
one
will
need
some
bridge
principles
or
links
that
connect
such
facts
with
facts
about
consciousness
(Kim
1998)
.


Brute
links
,
whether
nomic
or
merely
well
confirmed
correlations
,
could
provide
a
logically
sufficient
bridge
to
infer
conclusions
about
consciousness
.


But
they
would
probably
not
allow
us
to
see
how
or
why
those
connections
hold
,
and
thus
they
would
fall
short
of
fully
explaining
how
consciousness
exists
(Levine
1983
,
1993
,
McGinn
1991)
.



One
could
legitimately
ask
for
more
,
in
particular
for
some
account
that
---------------
satisfy
the
conditions
for
the
liquidity
of
the
water
they
compose
.


Moreover
,
the
model
makes
intelligible
how
the
liquidity
is
produced
by
the
micro-properties
.


A
satisfactory
explanation
of
how
consciousness
is
produced
might
seem
to
require
a
similar
two
stage
story
.


Without
it
,
even
a
priori
deducibility
might
seem
explanatorily
less
than
---------------
sometimes
described
,
following
Joseph
Levine
(1983)
,
as
the
existence
of
an
explanatory
gap
,
and
as
indicating
our
incomplete
understanding
of
how
consciousness
might
depend
upon
a
nonconscious

,
especially
a
physical
substrate
.


The
basic
gap
claim
admits
of
many
variations
in
generality
and
thus
in
strength
.


---------------

If
one
could
see
on
a
priori
grounds
that
there
is
no
way
in
which
consciousness
could
be
intelligibly
explained
as
arising
from
the
physical
,
it
would
not
be
a
big
step
to
concluding
that
it
in
fact
does
not
do
so
(Chalmers
1996)
.


However
,
the
very
strength
of
such
an
---------------
support
,
such
as
the
alleged
conceivability
of
zombies
molecularly
identical
with
conscious
humans
but
devoid
of
all
phenomenal
consciousness
(Campbell
1970
,
Kirk
1974
,
Chalmers
1996)
.


Other
supporting
arguments
invoke
the
supposed
non-functional
nature
of
consciousness
and
thus
its
alleged
resistance
to
the
standard
scientific
method
of
explaining
complex
properties
(e

,
genetic
dominance)
in
terms
of
physically
realized
functional
conditions
(Block
1980a
,
---------------
properties
and
relations
might
be
underlain
by
physical
ones
.


Thus
one
might
opt
for
a
similar
criterion
for
interpreting
the
How
question
and
for
what
counts
as
explaining
how
consciousness
might
be
caused
or
realized
by
nonconscious
items
.


However
,
some
critics
,
such
as
Kim
(1987)
,
have
challenged
the
coherence
of
any
view
that
aims
to
be
both
---------------
replied
in
turn
(Van
Gulick
1993)
.



Others
have
argued
that
consciousness
is
especially
resistant
to
explanation
in
physical
terms
because
of
the
inherent
differences
between
our
subjective
and
objective
modes
of
understanding
.


Thomas
---------------

The
How
question
thus
subdivides
into
a
diverse
family
of
more
specific
questions
depending
upon
the
specific
sort
or
feature
of
consciousness
one
aims
to
explain
,
the
specific
restrictions
one
places
on
the
range
of
the
explanans
and
the
criterion
one
uses
to
define
explanatory
success
.


Some
of
the
resulting
variants
seem
easier
to
answer
than
others
.


Progress
may
seem
likely
on
some
of
the
so
called
“easy
problems”
of
consciousness
,
such
as
explaining
the
dynamics
of
access
consciousness
in
terms
of
the
functional
or
computational
organization
of
the
brain
(Baars
1988)
.


Others
may
seem
less
tractable
,
especially
the
so-called
“hard
problem”
(Chalmers
1995)
which
is
more
or
less
that
of
giving
an
intelligible
account
that
lets
us
see
in
an
intuitively
satisfying
way
how
phenomenal
or
“what
it
'
s
like”
consciousness
might
arise
from
physical
or
neural
processes
in
the
brain
.



---------------
hand
,
but
others
appear
to
remain
deeply
baffling
.


Nor
should
we
assume
that
every
version
has
a
positive
answer
.


If
dualism
is
true
,
then
consciousness
in
at
least
some
of
its
types
may
be
basic
and
fundamental
.


If
so
,we
will
not
be
able
to
explain
how
it
arises
from
nonconscious
items
since
it
simply
does
not
do
so
.



One
'
s
view
of
the
prospects
for
explaining
consciousness
will
typically
depend
upon
one
'
s
perspective
.


Optimistic
physicalists
will
likely
see
current
explanatory
lapses
as
merely
the
reflection
of
the
early
stage
---------------
(Dennett
1991
,
Searle
1992
,
P
.


M
.

Churchland
1995)
.


To
dualists
,
those
same
impasses
will
signify
the
bankruptcy
of
the
physicalist
program
and
the
need
to
recognize
consciousness
as
a
fundamental
constituent
of
reality
in
its
own
right
(Robinson
1982
,
Foster
1989
,
1996
,
Chalmers
1996)
.


What
one
sees
depends
in
part
on
where
one
stands
,
and
the
ongoing
project
of
explaining
consciousness
will
be
accompanied
by
continuing
debate
about
its
status
and
prospects
for
success
.

The
functional
question
:
Why
does
consciousness
exist
?



The
functional
or
Why
question
asks
about
the
value
or
role
or
consciousness
and
thus
indirectly
about
its
origin
.


Does
it
have
a
function
,
and
if
so
what
is
it
?


Does
it
make
a
difference
to
the
operation
of
systems
in
which
it
is
present
,
and
if
so
why
and
how
?


If
consciousness
exists
as
a
complex
feature
of
biological
systems
,
then
its
adaptive
value
is
likely
relevant
to
explaining
its
evolutionary
origin
,
though
of
course
its
present
function
,
if
it
has
one
,
need
not
be
the
same
as
that
it
may
have
had
when
it
first
arose
.


Adaptive
functions
often
change
over
biological
time
.


Questions
about
the
value
of
consciousness
also
have
a
moral
dimension
in
at
least
two
ways
.


We
are
inclined
to
regard
an
organism
'
s
moral
status
as
at
least
partly
determined
by
the
nature
and
extent
to
which
it
is
conscious
,
and
---------------
As
with
the
What
and
How
questions
,
the
Why
question
poses
a
general
problem
that
subdivides
into
a
diversity
of
more
specific
inquiries
.


In
so
far
as
the
various
sorts
of
consciousness
,
e
.

g
.


,
access
,
phenomenal
,
meta-mental
,
are
distinct
and
separable—which
remains
an
open
question—they
likely
also
differ
in
their
specific
roles
and
values
.


Thus
the
Why
question
may
well
not
have
a
single
or
uniform
answer
.

1
Causal
status
of
consciousness

Perhaps
the
most
basic
issue
posed
by
any
version
of
the
Why
question
is
whether
or
not
consciousness
of
the
relevant
sort
has
any
causal
impact
at
all
.


If
it
has
no
effects
and
makes
no
causal
difference
whatsoever
,
then
it
would
seem
unable
to
play
any
significant
role
in
the
systems
or
---------------
inquiries
about
its
possible
value
.


Nor
can
the
threat
of
epiphenomenal
irrelevance
be
simply
dismissed
as
an
obvious
non-option
,
since
at
least
some
forms
of
consciousness
have
been
seriously
alleged
in
the
recent
literature
to
lack
causal
status
.


(See
the
entry
on
epiphenomenalism
.

)
Such
worries
have
been
raised
especially
with
regard
to
qualia
and
qualitative
consciousness
(Huxley
1874
,
Jackson
1982
,
Chalmers
1996)
,
but
challenges
have
also
been
leveled
against
the
causal
status
of
other
sorts
including
meta-mental
consciousness
(Velmans
1991)
.



Both
metaphysical
and
empirical
arguments
have
been
given
in
support
of
---------------
whose
behavior
,
functional
organization
,
and
physical
structure
down
to
the
molecular
level
are
identical
to
those
of
normal
human
agents
but
who
lack
any
qualia
or
qualitative
consciousness
.


Some
(Kirk
1970
,
Chalmers
1996)
assert
such
beings
are
possible
in
worlds
that
share
all
our
physical
laws
,
but
others
deny
it
(Dennett
1991
,
Levine
2001)
.


If
---------------

Arguments
of
a
far
more
empirical
sort
have
challenged
the
causal
status
of
meta-mental
consciousness
,
at
least
in
so
far
as
its
presence
can
be
measured
by
the
ability
to
report
on
one
'
s
mental
state
.


Scientific
evidence
is
claimed
to
show
that
consciousness
of
that
sort
is
neither
necessary
for
any
type
of
mental
ability
nor
does
it
occur
early
enough
to
act
as
a
cause
of
the
acts
or
processes
typically
thought
to
be
its
effects
(Velmans
1991)
.


According
to
those
who
make
such
arguments
,
the
sorts
of
mental
abilities
that
are
typically
thought
to
require
consciousness
can
all
be
realized
unconsciously
in
the
absence
of
the
supposedly
required
self-awareness
.



---------------
occurs
too
late
to
be
the
cause
of
the
relevant
actions
rather
than
their
result
or
at
best
a
joint
effect
of
some
shared
prior
cause
(Libet
1985)
.


Self-awareness
or
meta-mental
consciousness
according
to
these
arguments
turns
out
to
be
a
psychological
after-effect
rather
than
an
initiating
cause
,
more
like
a
post
facto
printout
or
the
result
---------------
Flanagan
1992
,
and
commentaries
accompanying
Velmans
1991)
.


Though
the
empirical
arguments
,
like
the
zombie
claims
,
require
one
to
consider
seriously
whether
some
forms
of
consciousness
may
be
less
causally
potent
than
is
typically
assumed
,
many
theorists
regard
the
empirical
data
as
no
real
threat
to
the
causal
status
of
consciousness
.



If
the
epiphenomenalists
are
wrong
and
consciousness
,
in
its
various
forms
,
is
indeed
causal
,
what
sorts
of
effects
does
it
have
and
what
differences
does
it
make
?


How
do
mental
processes
that
involve
the
relevant
sort
of
consciousness
differ
form
those
that
lack
it
?


What
function(s)
might
consciousness
play
?


The
following
six
sections
(6
.

2–6
.

7)
discuss
some
of
the
more
commonly
given
answers
.


Though
the
various
functions
overlap
to
some
degree
,
each
is
distinct
,
and
they
differ
as
well
in
the
sorts
of
consciousness
with
which
each
is
most
aptly
linked
.



---------------
automatic
unconscious
mental
operations
(Anderson
1983)
.


The
relevant
increases
in
flexibility
would
seem
most
closely
connected
with
the
meta-mental
or
higher-order
form
of
consciousness
in
so
far
as
the
enhanced
ability
to
control
processes
depends
upon
greater
self-awareness
.


However
,
flexibility
and
sophisticated
modes
of
control
may
be
associated
as
well
with
the
phenomenal
and
access
forms
of
consciousness
.

Social
coordination

Enhanced
capacity
for
social
coordination
.


Consciousness
of
the
meta-mental
sort
may
well
involve
not
only
an
increase
in
self-awareness
but
also
an
enhanced
understanding
of
the
mental
states
of
other
minded
---------------
This
increase
in
mutually
shared
knowledge
of
each
other
'
s
minds
,
enables
the
relevant
organisms
to
interact
,
cooperate
and
communicate
in
more
advanced
and
adaptive
ways
.


Although
meta-mental
consciousness
is
the
sort
most
obviously
linked
to
such
a
socially
coordinative
role
,
narrative
consciousness
of
the
kind
associated
with
the
stream
of
consciousness
is
also
clearly
relevant
in
so
far
as
it
involves
the
application
to
one
'
s
own
case
of
the
interpretative
abilities
that
derive
in
part
from
their
social
application
(Ryle
1949
,
Dennett
1978
,
---------------
conscious
experience
.


The
unity
of
experienced
space
is
just
one
example
of
the
sort
of
integration
associated
with
our
conscious
awareness
of
an
objective
world
.


(See
the
entry
on
unity
of
consciousness
.

)

This
integrative
role
or
value
is
most
directly
associated
with
access
consciousness
,
but
also
clearly
with
the
larger
phenomenal
and
intentional
structure
of
experience
.


It
is
relevant
even
to
the
qualitative
aspect
of
consciousness
in
so
far
as
qualia
play
an
important
role
in
our
experience
of
unified
objects
in
a
unified
space
or
scene
.


It
is
intimately
tied
as
well
to
the
transparency
of
---------------
semantic
transparency
(Van
Gulick

.


Integration
of
information
plays
a
major
role
in
several
current
neuro-cognitive
theories
of
consciousness

and
Giulio
Tononi
'
s
Integrated
Information
theory
(section

.



---------------

This
particular
role
is
most
directly
and
definitionally
tied
to
the
notion
of
access
consciousness
(Block
1995)
,
but
meta-mental
consciousness
as
well
as
the
phenomenal
and
qualitative
forms
all
seem
plausibly
linked
to
such
increases
in
the
availability
of
information
(Armstrong
1981
,
Tye
1985)
.


Diverse
cognitive
and
neuro-cognitive
theories

as
a
central
feature
of
consciousness
and

processing

(See
the
entry
on
free
will
.

)
The
notion
of
free
will
may
itself
remain
too
murky
and
contentious
to
shed
any
clear
light
on
the
role
of
consciousness
,
but
there
is
a
traditional
intuition
that
the
two
are
deeply
linked
.



Consciousness
has
been
thought
to
open
a
realm
of
possibilities
,
a
sphere
of
options
within
which
the
conscious
self
might
choose
or
act
freely
.


At
a
minimum
,
consciousness
might
seem
a
necessary
precondition
for
any
such
freedom
or
self-determination
(Hasker
1999)
.


How
could
one
engage
in
the
requisite
sort
of
free
choice
,
while
remaining
solely
---------------
own
nature
and
future
development
may
admit
of
many
interesting
variations
and
degrees
rather
than
being
a
simple
all
or
nothing
matter
,
and
various
forms
or
levels
of
consciousness
might
be
correlated
with
corresponding
degrees
or
types
of
freedom
and
self-determination
(Dennett
1984
,
2003)
.


The
link
with
freedom
seems
strongest
for
the
meta-mental
form
of
consciousness
given
its
emphasis
on
self-awareness
,
but
potential
connections
also
seem
possible
for
most
of
the
other
sorts
as
well
.


---------------
appearance
of
intrinsic
and
directly
experienced
motivational
force
is
illusory
.


But
if
it
is
real
,
then
it
may
be
one
of
the
most
important
and
evolutionarily
oldest
respects
in
which
consciousness
makes
a
difference
to
the
mental
systems
and
processes
in
which
it
is
present
(Humphreys
1992)
.



Other
suggestions
have
been
made
about
the
possible
roles
and
value
of
consciousness
,
and
these
six
surely
do
not
exhaust
the
options
.


Nonetheless
,
they
are
among
the
most
prominent
recent
hypotheses
,
and
they
provide
a
fair
survey
of
the
sorts
of
answers
that
have
been
offered
to
the
Why
question
by
those
who
believe
consciousness
does
indeed
make
a
difference
.



---------------
of
contingent
realization
.


In
the
former
,
fulfilling
the
role
constitutes
being
conscious
in
the
relevant
sense
,
while
in
the
latter
case
consciousness
of
a
given
sort
is
just
one
way
among
several
in
which
the
requisite
role
might
be
realized
(Van
Gulick
1993)
.



---------------
variety
of
subsystems
and
behavioral
applications
may
constitute
its
being
conscious
in
the
access
sense
.


By
contrast
,
even
if
the
qualitative
and
phenomenal
forms
of
consciousness
involve
a
highly
unified
and
densely
integrated
representation
of
objective
reality
,
it
may
be
possible
to
produce
representations
having
those
functional
---------------
that
happened
to
arise
in
our
evolutionary
ancestry
.


If
so
,
there
may
be
quite
other
means
of
achieving
a
comparable
result
without
qualitative
or
phenomenal
consciousness
.


Whether
this
is
the
right
way
to
think
about
phenomenal
and
qualitative
conscious
is
unclear
;
perhaps
the
tie
to
unified
and
densely
integrated
representation
is
in
fact
as
intimate
and
constitutive
as
it
seems
to
be
in
the
case
of
access
consciousness
(Carruthers
2000)
.


Regardless
of
how
that
issue
gets
resolved
,
it
is
important
to
not
to
conflate
constitution
accounts
with
contingent
realization
accounts
when
addressing
the
function
of
consciousness
and
answering
the
question
of
why
it
exists
(Chalmers
1996)
.

Theories
of
consciousness

In
response
to
the
What
,
How
and
Why
questions
many
theories
of
consciousness
have
been
proposed
in
recent
years
.


However
,
not
all
theories
of
consciousness
are
theories
of
the
same
thing
.


They
vary
not
only
in
the
specific
sorts
of
consciousness
they
take
as
their
object
,
but
also
in
their
theoretical
aims
.



Perhaps
the
largest
division
is
between
general
metaphysical
theories
that
aim
to
locate
consciousness
in
the
overall
ontological
scheme
of
reality
and
more
specific
theories
that
offer
detailed
accounts
of
its
nature
,
features
and
role
.

line

the
two

of
theories

Dualist
theories

Dualist
theories
regard
at
least
some
aspects
of
consciousness
as
falling
outside

realm
of
the
physical
,but
specific
forms

consciousness
inheres
.


Though
substance
dualism
is
at
present
largely
out
of
favor
,
it
does
have
some
contemporary
proponents
(Swinburne
1986
,
Foster
1989
,
1996)
.


---------------
1996)
according
to
which
the
proto-mental
aspects
of
micro-constituents
can
give
rise
under
suitable
conditions
of
combination
to
full
blown
consciousness
.


(See
the
entry
on
panpsychism
.

)

The
nature
of
the
relevant
proto-psychic
aspect
remains
unclear
,
and
---------------
properties
do
not
involve
any
such
feel
,
it
is
not
clear
how
they
are
any
better
able
than
physical
properties
to
account
for
qualitative
consciousness
in
solving
the
Hard
Problem
.



A
more
modest
form
of
panpsychism
has
been
advocated
by
the
neuroscientist
Giulio
Tononi
(2008)
and
endorsed
by
other
neuroscientists
including
Christof
Koch
(2012)
.


This
version
derives
from
Tononi
'
s
integrated
information
theory
(IIT)
of
consciousness
that
identifies
consciousness
with
integrated
information
which
can
exist
in
many
degrees
(see
section
9
.

6
below)
.


According
to
IIT
,
even
a
simple
indicator
device
such
as
a
single
photo
diode
possesses
some
degree
of
integrated
information
and
thus
some
limited
degree
of
consciousness
,
a
consequence
which
both
Tononi
and
Koch
embrace
as
a
form
of
panpsychism
.



A
variety
of
arguments
have
been
given
in
favor
of
dualist
and
other
anti-physicalist
theories
of
consciousness
.


Some
are
largelya
priori
in
nature
such
as
those
that
appeal
to
the
supposed
conceivability
of
zombies
(Kirk
1970
,
Chalmers
1996)
or
versions
of
the
knowledge
argument
(Jackson
1982
,
1986)
which
aim
to
reach
an
anti-physicalist
conclusion
about
the
ontology
of
consciousness
from
the
apparent
limits
on
our
ability
to
fully
understand
the
qualitative
aspects
of
conscious
experience
through
third-person
physical
accounts
of
the

2
Physicalist
theories

Most
other
metaphysical
theories
of
consciousness
are
versions
of
physicalism
of
one
familiar
sort
or
another
.



Eliminativist
theories
reductively
deny
the
existence
of
consciousness
or
at
least
the
existence
of
some
of
its
commonly
accepted
sorts
or
features
.


(See
the
entry
on
eliminative
materialism
.

)
The
radical
eliminativists
reject
the
very
notion
of
consciousness
as
muddled
or
wrong
headed
and
claim
that
the
conscious/nonconscious
distinction
fails
to
cut
mental
reality
at
its
joints
(Wilkes
1984
,
1988)
.


They
regard
the
idea
of
consciousness
as
sufficiently
off
target
to
merit
elimination
and
replacement
by
other
concepts
and
distinctions
more
reflective
of
the
true
nature
of
mind
(P
.


S
.


Churchland
1983)
.


---------------
Kinsbourne
1992)
.


More
modest
eliminativists
,
like
Dennett
,
thus
typically
combine
their
qualified
denials
with
a
positive
theory
of
those
aspects
of
consciousness
they
take
as
real
,
such
as
the
Multiple
Drafts
Model
(section
9
.

3
below)
.



---------------
to
dissolve
the
explanatory
gap
problem
.



Most
physicalist
theories
of
consciousness
are
neither
eliminativist
nor
based
on
strict
type-type
identities
.


They
acknowledge
the
reality
of
consciousness
but
aim
to
locate
it
within
the
physical
world
on
the
basis
of
some
psycho-physical
relation
short
of
strict
property
identity
.


---------------

Functionalist
theories
in
particular
rely
heavily
on
the
notion
of
realization
to
explicate
the
relation
between
consciousness
and
the
physical
.


According
to
functionalism
,
a
state
or
process
counts
as
being
of
a
given
mental
or
conscious
type
in
virtue
of
the
functional
role
it
---------------
at
an
underlying
level
.



Critics
of
functionalism
often
deny
that
consciousness
can
be
adequately
explicated
in
functional
terms
(Block
1980a
,
1980b
,
Levine
1983
,
Chalmers
1996)
.


According
to
such
critics
,
consciousness
may
have
interesting
functional
characteristics
but
its
nature
is
not
essentially
functional
.


Such
claims
are
sometimes
supported
by
appeal
to
the
---------------
issue
remains
under
debate
.

Specific
Theories
of
Consciousness

Although
there
are
many
general
metaphysical/ontological
theories
of
consciousness
,
the
list
of
specific
detailed
theories
about
its
nature
is
even
longer
and
more
diverse
.


No
brief
survey
could
be
close
to
comprehensive
,
but
seven
main
types
of
theories
may
help
to
indicate
the
---------------
unconscious
consists
in
the
fact
that
we
are
not
reflexively
and
directly
aware
of
being
in
them
.


(See
the
entry
on
higher-order
theories
of
consciousness
.

)

Higher-order
theories
come
in
two
main
variants
that
differ
concerning
---------------

The
higher-order
view
is
most
obviously
relevant
to
the
meta-mental
forms
of
consciousness
,
but
some
of
its
supporters
take
it
to
explain
other
types
of
consciousness
as
well
,
including
the
more
subjective
what
it
'
s
like
and
qualitative
types
.


One
common
strategy
is
to
analyze
qualia
as
mental
features
that
are
capable
of
occurring
unconsciously
;
---------------
(Papineau
2002)
.


Whether
or
not
such
proposed
HO
accounts
of
qualia
are
successful
,
it
is
important
to
note
that
most
HO
advocates
take
themselves
to
be
offering
a
comprehensive
theory
of
consciousness
,
or
at
least
the
core
of
such
a
general
theory
,
rather
than
merely
one
limited
to
some
special
meta-mental
forms
of
it
.



Other
variants
of
HO
theory
go
beyond
the
standard
HOT
and
HOP
versions
including
some
that
analyze
consciousness
in
terms
of
dispositional
rather
than
occurrent
higher-order
thoughts
(Carruthers
2000)
.


Others
appeal
to
implicit
rather
than
explicit
higher-order
understanding
and
---------------

Reflexive
theories
,
like
higher-order
theories
,
imply
a
strong
link
between
consciousness
and
self-awareness
.


They
differ
in
that
they
locate
the
aspect
of
self-awareness
directly
within
the
conscious
state
itself
rather
than
in
a
distinct
meta-state
directed
at
it
.


The
idea
---------------
(Gennaro
2004
,
2012)
while
others
reject
the
higher-order
category
and
describe
their
theories
as
presenting
a
“same-order”
account
of
consciousness
as
self-awareness
(Kriegel
2009)
.


Yet
others
challenge
the
level
distinction
by
analyzing
the
meta-intentional
content
as
implicit
in
the
phenomenal
first-order
content
of
conscious
states
,
as
in
so
---------------

3
Representationalist
theories

Almost
all
theories
of
consciousness
regard
it
as
having
representational
features
,
but
so
called
representationalist
theories
are
defined
by
the
stronger
view
that
its
representational
features
---------------
obvious
targets
for
such
elimination
.


Indeed
part
of
the
motivation
for
representationalism
is
to
show
that
one
can
accommodate
all
the
facts
about
consciousness
,
perhaps
within
a
physicalist
framework
,
without
needing
to
find
room
for
qualia
or
any
other
apparently
non-representational
mental
properties
(Dennett
1990
,
Lycan
1996
,
---------------

.

4
Narrative
Interpretative
Theories

Some
theories
of
consciousness
stress
the
interpretative
nature
of
facts
about
consciousness
.


According
to
such
views
,
what
is
or
is
not
conscious
is
not
always
a
determinate
fact
,
or
at
least
not
so
independent
of
a
larger
context
of
interpretative
judgments
.


The
most
prominent
philosophical
example
is
the
Multiple
Drafts
Model
(MDM)
of
consciousness
,
advanced
by
Daniel
Dennett
(1991)
.


It
combines
elements
of
both
representationalism
and
higher-order
theory
but
does
so
in
a
way
that
varies
interestingly
from
the
more
standard
versions
of
either
providing
a
more
interpretational
and
less
strongly
realist
view
of
consciousness
.



The
MDM
includes
many
distinct
but
interrelated
features
.


Its
name
---------------
“multiple”
of
the
Multiple
Drafts
Model
.



The
MDM
is
representationalist
in
that
it
analyzes
consciousness
in
terms
of
content
relations
.


It
also
denies
the
existence
of
qualia
and
thus
rejects
any
attempt
to
distinguish
conscious
states
from
---------------
Dennett
'
s
MDM
has
been
highly
influential
but
has
also
drawn
criticism
,
especially
from
those
who
find
it
insufficiently
realist
in
its
view
of
consciousness
and
at
best
incomplete
in
achieving
its
stated
goal
to
fully
explain
it
(Block
1994
,
Dretske
1994
,
Levine
1994)
.


Many
of
its
critics
acknowledge
the
insight
and
value
of
the
MDM
,
but
deny
that
there
are
no
real
facts
of
consciousness
other
than
those
captured
by
it
(Rosenthal
1994
,
Van
Gulick
1994
,
Akins
1996)

that
makes
sense
of
our
actions
in
any
inferential
way
and
constructs
an
ongoing
narrative
of
our
actions
and
experience
.


Though
the
theory
is
not
intended
as
a
complete
theory
of
consciousness
,
it
accords
a
major
role
to
such
interpretative
narrative
activity
.

5
Cognitive
Theories

A
number
theories
of
consciousness
associate
it
with
a
distinct
cognitive
architecture
or
with
a
special
pattern
of
activity
with
that
structure
.


---------------
Global
Workspace
.


A
major
psychological
example
of
the
cognitive
approach
is
the
Global
Workspace
theory
.


As
initially
developed
by
Bernard
Baars
(1988))
global
workspace
theory
describes
consciousness
in
terms
of
a
competition
among
processors
and
outputs
for
a
limited
capacity
resource
that
“broadcasts”
information
for
widespread
access
---------------
The
model
has
been
further
developed
with
proposed
connections
to
particular
neural
and
functional
brain
systems
by
Stanislas
Dehaene
and
others
(2000)
.


Of
special
importance
is
the
claim
that
consciousness
in
both
the
access
and
phenomenal
sense
occurs
when
and
only
when
the
relevant
content
enters
the
larger
global
network
involving
both
primary
---------------

The
integration
of
information
from
many
sources
is
an
important
feature
of
consciousness
and
,
as
noted
above
(section
6
.

4)
,
is
often
cited
as
one
of
its
major
functions
.


Content
integration
plays
an
important
role
in
various
theories
especially
global
workspace
theory
(section
9
.

3)
.


However
,
a
proposal
by
the
neuroscientist
Giulio
Tononi
(2008)
goes
further
in
identifying
consciousness
with
integrated
information
and
asserting
that
information
integration
of
the
relevant
sort
is
both
necessary
and
sufficient
for
consciousness
regardless
of
the
substrate
in
which
it
is
realized
(which
need
not
be
neural
or
biological)
.


According
to
Tononi
'
s
Integrated
Information
Theory
(IIT)
,
consciousness
is
a
purely
information-theoretic
property
of
systems
.


He
proposes
a
mathematical
measure
φ
that
aims
to
measure
not
merely
the
information
---------------
highest
φ
value
will
be
conscious
according
to
IIT
.



According
to
IIT
,
consciousness
varies
in
quantity
and
comes
in
many
degrees
which
correspond
to
φ
values
.


Thus
even
a
simple
system
such
a
single
photo
diode
will
be
conscious
to
some
degree
if
it
is
not
contained
within
a
larger
complex
.


In
that
sense
,
IIT
implies
a
form
of
panpsychism
that
Tononi
explicitly
endorses
.


According
to
IIT
,
the
quality
of
the
relevant
consciousness
is
determined
by
the
totality
of
informational
relations
within
the
relevant
integrated
complex
.


Thus
IIT
aims
to
explain
both
the
quantity
and
quality
of
phenomenal
consciousness
.


Other
neuroscientists
,
notably
Christof
Koch
,
have
also
endorsed
the
IIT
approach
(Koch
2012)
.

7
Neural
Theories

Neural
theories
of
consciousness
come
in
many
forms
,
though
most
in
some
way
concern
the
so
called
“neural
correlates
of
consciousness”
or
NCCs
.


Unless
one
is
a
dualist
or
other
non-physicalist
,
more
than
mere
correlation
is
required
;
at
least
some
NCCs
must
be
the
essential
substrates
of
consciousness
.


An
explanatory
neural
theory
needs
to
explain
why
or
how
the
relevant
correlations
exist
,
and
if
the
theory
is
committed
to
physicalism
that
will
require
showing
how
the
underlying
---------------

Such
theories
are
diverse
not
only
in
the
neural
processes
or
properties
to
which
they
appeal
but
also
in
the
aspects
of
consciousness
they
take
as
their
respective
explananda
.


Some
are
based
on
high-level
systemic
features
of
the
brain
,
but
others
focus
on
more
specific
physiological
or
structural
properties
,
with
corresponding
differences
in
their
intended
explanatory
targets
.


Most
in
some
way
aim
to
connect
with
theories
of
consciousness
at
other
levels
of
description
such
as
cognitive
,
representational
or
higher-order
theories
.



---------------
In
each
case
the
aim
is
to
explain
how
organization
and
activity
at
the
relevant
neural
level
could
underlie
one
or
another
major
type
or
feature
of
consciousness
.


Global
fields
or
transient
synchronous
assemblies
could
underlie
the
intentional
unity
of
phenomenal
consciousness
.


NMDA-based
plasticity
,
specific
thalamic
projections
into
the
cortex
,
or
regular
oscillatory
waves
could
all
contribute
to
the
formation
of
short
term
but
widespread
neural
patterns
or
regularities
---------------
One
particular
recent
controversy
has
concerned
the
issue
of
whether
global
or
merely
local
recurrent
activity
is
sufficient
for
phenomenal
consciousness
.


Supporters
of
the
global
neuronal
workspace
model
(Dehaene
2000)
have
argued
that
consciousness
of
any
sort
can
occur
only
when
contents
are
activated
with
a
large
scale
pattern
of
recurrent
activity
involving
frontal
and
parietal
areas
as
well
as
primary
sensory
---------------
(2006)
and
the
philosopher
Ned
Block
(2007)
have
argued
that
local
recurrent
activity
between
higher
and
lower
areas
within
sensory
cortex
(e
.

g
.


with
visual
cortex)
can
suffice
for
phenomenal
consciousness
even
in
the
absence
of
verbal
reportability
and
other
indicators
of
access
consciousness
.

Quantum
theories

Other
physical
theories
have
gone
beyond
the
neural
and
placed
the
natural
locus
of
consciousness
at
a
far
more
fundamental
level
,
in
particular
at
the
micro-physical
level
of
quantum
phenomena
.


According
to
such
theories
,
the
nature
and
basis
of
consciousness
can
not
be
adequately
understood
within
the
framework
of
classical
physics
but
must
be
sought
within
the
alternative
picture
of
physical
reality
provided
by
quantum
mechanics
.


The
proponents
of
the
quantum
consciousness
approach
regard
the
radically
alternative
and
often
counterintuitive
nature
of
quantum
physics
as
just
what
is
needed
to
overcome
the
supposed
---------------
Again
there
are
a
wide
range
of
specific
theories
and
models
that
have
been
proposed
,
appealing
to
a
variety
of
quantum
phenomena
to
explain
a
diversity
of
features
of
consciousness
.


It
would
be
impossible
to
catalog
them
here
or
even
explain
in
any
substantial
way
the
key
features
of
quantum
mechanics
to
which
they
appeal
.


However
,
a
brief
---------------

The
physicist
Roger
Penrose
(1989
,
1994)
and
the
anesthesiologist
Stuart
Hameroff
(1998)
have
championed
a
model
according
to
which
consciousness
arises
through
quantum
effects
occurring
within
subcellular
structures
internal
to
neurons
known
as
microtubules
.


The
model
posits
so
called
---------------

The
psychiatrist
Ian
Marshall
has
offered
a
model
that
aims
to
explain
the
coherent
unity
of
consciousness
by
appeal
to
the
production
within
the
brain
of
a
physical
state
akin
to
that
of
a
Bose-Einstein
condensate
.


The
latter
is
a
quantum
phenomenon
in
which
a
collection
of
---------------
similar
coherence
(Marshall
and
Zohar
1990)
.



A
basis
for
consciousness
has
also
been
sought
in
the
holistic
nature
of
quantum
mechanics
and
the
phenomenon
of
entanglement
,
according
to
which
particles
that
have
interacted
continue
to
have
their
natures
depend
upon
each
other
even
after
their
separation
.


Unsurprisingly
these
models
have
been
targeted
especially
at
explaining
the
coherence
of
consciousness
,
but
they
have
also
been
invoked
as
a
more
general
challenge
to
the
atomistic
conception
of
traditional
physics
according
to
which
the
properties
of
wholes
are
to
be
explained
by
appeal
to
the
properties
of
their
parts
plus
their
mode
of
combination
,
a
method
of
explanation
that
might
be
regarded
as
unsuccessful
to
date
in
explaining
consciousness
(Silberstein
1998
,
2001)
.



Others
have
taken
quantum
mechanics
to
indicate
that
consciousness
is
an
absolutely
fundamental
property
of
physical
reality
,
one
that
needs
to
be
brought
in
at
the
very
most
basic
level
(Stapp
1993)
.


They
have
---------------
upon
its
being
consciously
observed
.



There
are
many
other
quantum
models
of
consciousness
to
be
found
in
the
literature—some
advocating
a
radically
revisionist
metaphysics
and
others
not—but
these
four
provide
a
reasonable
,
though

Non-physical
theories

Most
specific
theories
of
consciousness—whether
cognitive
,
neural
or
quantum
mechanical—aim
to
explain
or
model
consciousness
as
a
natural
feature
of
the
physical
world
.


However
,
those
who
reject
a
physicalist
ontology
of
consciousness
must
find
ways
of
modeling
it
as
a
nonphysical
aspect
of
reality
.


Thus
those
who
adopt
a
dualist
or
anti-physicalist
metaphysical
view
must
in
the
end
provide
specific
models
of
consciousness
different
from
the
five
types
above
.


Both
substance
dualists
and
property
dualists
must
develop
the
details
of
their
theories
in
ways
that
articulate
the
specific
natures
of
the
relevant
non-physical
features
of
reality
with
which
they
equate
consciousness
or
to
which
they
appeal
in
order
to
explain
it
.



---------------
the
physical
as
itself
derived
from
the
informational
(a
version
of
“it
from
bit”
theory)
.


In
a
somewhat
similar
vein
,
Gregg
Rosenberg
has
(2004)
proposed
an
account
of
consciousness
that
simultaneously
addresses
the
ultimate
categorical
basis
of
causal
relations
.


In
both
the
causal
case
and
the
conscious
case
,
Rosenberg
argues
the
---------------
relations
and
qualitative
phenomenal
facts
both
depend
upon
the
same
base
.


Also
,
as
noted
just
above
(section
9
.

8)
,
some
quantum
theories
treat
consciousness
as
a
fundamental
feature
of
reality
(Stapp
1993)
,
and
insofar
as
they
do
so
,
they
might
be
plausibly
classified
as
non-physical
theories
as
well
.

Conclusion

A
comprehensive
understanding
of
consciousness
will
likely
require
theories
of
many
types
.


One
might
usefully
and
without
contradiction
accept
a
diversity
of
models
that
each
in
their
own
way
aim
respectively
to
explain
the
physical
,
neural
,
cognitive
,
functional
,
representational
and
higher-order
aspects
of
consciousness
.


There
is
unlikely
to
be
any
single
theoretical
perspective
that
suffices
for
explaining
all
the
features
of
consciousness
that
we
wish
to
understand
.


Thus
a
synthetic
and
pluralistic
approach
may
provide
the
best
road
to
future
progress
.

Activism

Consciousness
raising
(also
called
awareness
raising)
is
a
form
of
activism
popularized
by
United
States
feminists
in
the
late
1960s
.


It
often
takes

---------------

Until
the
early-17th
century
,
English
speakers
used
the
word
"consciousness"
in
the
sense
of
"moral
knowledge
of
right
or
wrong"—a
concept
today
referred
to
as
"conscience"
.

^([3])

---------------
[edit]

Consciousness
raising
groups
were
formed
by
New
York
Radical
Women
,
an
early
Women
'
s
Liberation
group
in
New
York
City
,
and
quickly
spread
throughout
the
United
States
.


In
November
1967
,
a
group
including
---------------
Amatniek)
,
and
Carol
Hanisch
began
meeting
in
Koedt
'
s
apartment
.


Meetings
often
involved
"going
around
the
room
and
talking"
about
issues
in
their
own
lives
.


The
phrase
"consciousness
raising"
was
coined
to
describe
the
process
when
Kathie
Sarachild
took
up
the
phrase
from
Anne
Forer
:


In
the
Old
Left
,
they
used
to
say
that
the
workers
don
'
t
know
they
'
re

oppressed
,
so
we
have
to
raise
their
consciousness
.


One
night
at
a

meeting
I
said
,

'
Would
everybody
please
give
me
an
example
from
their

own
life
on
how
they
experienced
oppression
as
a
woman
?


I
need
to
hear

it
to
raise
my
own
consciousness
.


'

Kathie
was
sitting
behind
me
and

the
words
rang
in
her
mind
.


From
then
on
she
sort
of
made
it
an

institution
and
called
it
consciousness-raising
.




—
Anne
Forer^([4])

On
Thanksgiving
1968
,
Kathie
Sarachild
presented
A
Program
for
Feminist
Consciousness
Raising
,
at
the
First
National
Women
'
s
Liberation
Conference
near
Chicago
,
Illinois
,
in
which
she
explained
the
principles
behind
consciousness-raising
and
outlined
a
program
for
the
process
that
the
New
York
groups
had
developed
over
the
past
year
.


Groups
founded
by
former
members
of
New
York
Radical
Women—in
particular
Redstockings
,
founded
out
of
the
breakup
of
the
NYRW
in
1969
,
and
New
York
Radical
Feminists—promoted
consciousness
raising
and
distributed
mimeographed
sheets
of
suggesting
topics
for
consciousness
raising
group
meetings
.


New
York
Radical
Feminists
organized
neighborhood-based

groups
in
Manhattan
,
Brooklyn
,
and
Queens
,
involving
as
many
as
four
hundred
women
in
c
.

r
.


groups
at
its
peak
.

^([5])
Over
the
next
few
years
,
small-group
consciousness
raising
spread
rapidly
in
cities
and
suburbs
throughout
the
United
States
.


By
1971
,
the
Chicago
Women
'
s
Liberation
Union
,
which
had
already
organized
several
consciousness
raising
groups
in
Chicago
,
described
small
consciousness
raising
groups
as
"the
backbone
of
the
Women
'
s
Liberation
Movement"
.

^([6])
Susan
Brownmiller
,
a
member
of
the
West
Village^([a])
would
later
write
that
small-group
consciousness
raising
"was
the
movement
'
s
most
successful
form
of
female
bonding
,
and
the
source
of
most
of
its
creative
thinking
.


Some
of
the
small
groups
---------------
as
"personal
,"
or
as
the
results
of
conflicts
between
the
personalities
of
individual
men
and
women
,
rather
than
systematic
forms
of
oppression
.


Raising
consciousness
meant
helping
oneself
and
helping
others
to
become
politically
conscious
.


Consciousness
raising
groups
aimed
to
get
a
better
understanding
of
women
'
s
oppression
by
bringing
women
together
to
discuss
and
analyze
their
lives
,
without
interference
from
the
presence
of
men
.

^([9])

While
explaining
the
theory
behind
consciousness
raising
in
a
1973
talk
,
Kathie
Sarachild
remarked
that
"From
the
beginning
of
consciousness-raising 
.


.


.


there
has
been
no
one
method
of
raising
consciousness
.


What
really
counts
in
consciousness-raising
are
not
methods
,
but
results
.


The
only

'
methods
'

of
consciousness
raising
are
essentially
principles
.


They
are
the
basic
radical
political
principles
of
going
to
the
original
sources
,
both
historic
and
personal
,
going
to
people—women
themselves
,
and
going
to
experience
for
theory
and
strategy"
.

^([10])
However
,
most
consciousness
raising
groups
did
follow
a
similar
pattern
for
meeting
and
discussion
.


Meetings
would
usually
be
held
about
once
a
week
,
with
a
small
group
of
women
,
often
in
the
living
---------------
knowledge
that
was
shared
.

^([citation
needed])

Some
feminist
advocates
of
consciousness
raising
argued
that
the
process
allowed
women
to
analyze
the
conditions
of
their
own
lives
,
and
to
discover
ways
in
which
what
had
seemed
like
isolated
,
individual
---------------
actions"
.

^([11])

Ellen
Willis
wrote
in
1984
that
consciousness
raising
has
often
been
"misunderstood
and
disparaged
as
a
form
of
therapy"
,
but
that
it
was
,
in
fact
,
in
its
time
and
context
,
"the
primary
method
of
understanding
---------------
philosophical
assumptions"
.

^([12])

However
,
some
in
the
feminist
movement
criticised
consciousness
raising
groups
as
"trivial"
and
apolitical
.

on
with
gay

who
formed
the
first
"coming-out

which
helped
participants
come
out
of
the
closet
among
welcoming

tolerant
individuals
and
share
personal
stories
about
coming

The
idea
of
coming

as
a
tool
of
consciousness-raising
had
been
preceded
by
even
earlier
opinions
from
German
theorists
such
as
Magnus
Hirschfeld
,
Iwan
Bloch
and
Karl
Heinrich
Ulrichs
,
all
of
whom
saw
self-disclosure
as
a
means
of
self-emancipation

the
raising
of
consciousness
among
fellow
un-closeted
individuals
and
a
means
of

Consciousness
is
the
individual
awareness
of
your
unique
thoughts
,
memories
,
feelings
,
sensations
,
and
environments
.


Essentially
,
your
consciousness
is
your
awareness
of
yourself
and
the
world
around
you
.



This
awareness
is
subjective
and
unique
to
you
.


If
you
can
describe
something
you
are
experiencing
in
words
,
then
it
is
part
of
your
consciousness
.



Your
conscious
experiences
are
constantly
shifting
and
changing
.


For
example
,
in
one
moment
,
you
may
be
focused
on
reading
this
article
.


Your
consciousness
may
then
shift
to
the
memory
of
a
conversation
you
had
earlier
with
a
co-worker
.


Next
,
you
might
notice
how
uncomfortable
your
chair
is
,
or
maybe
you
are
mentally
planning
dinner
.


---------------
effortless
.




States
of
Consciousness


The
various
states
of
consciousness
include
:

-
Dreams
---------------
-
States
induced
by
psychoactive
drugs

The
two
normal
states
of
awareness
are
consciousness
and
unconsciousness
.


Higher
states
of
consciousness
are
often
associated
with
spiritual
or
mystical
experiences
.


It
involves
an
elevated
state
of
awareness
where
people
are
able
to
gain
a
greater
sense
of
themselves
,
---------------
states
.

 

Altered
levels
of
consciousness
also
can
occur
,
which
may
be
caused
by
medical
or
mental
conditions
that
impair
or
change
awareness
.

 
Altered
types
of
consciousness
include
:

-
Coma
---------------

Doctors
and
healthcare
professionals
use
various
assessments
to
measure
and
assess
levels
of
consciousness
.


They
use
scores
on
these
assessments
to
guide
diagnosis
and
treatment
decisions
.



What
Are
the
5
Levels
of
Consciousness
?



Conscious
:
Everything
you
are
aware
of
---------------
awareness
and
sensation

Subconscious
:
Information
that
is
out
of
consciousness
and
not
immediately
available
to
consciousness

What
Is
the
Unconscious
Mind
?




Functions
of
Consciousness


Consciousness
has
several
biological
and
social
purposes
.


For
example
,
it
allows
us
to
process
information
,
choose
our
actions
,
set
priorities
,
learn
and
adapt
to
new
information
,
make
decisions
,
and
more
.



Consciousness
is
an
essential
state
in
philosophy
,
spirituality
,
and
religion
.


All
of
these
require
self-awareness
,
which
is
impossible
without
consciousness
.




Changes
in
Consciousness


Understanding
different
levels
of
consciousness
can
help
healthcare
professionals
spot
signs
that
someone
might
be
experiencing
a
problem
.


Some
of
these
changes
occur
naturally
;
others
are
the
result
of
factors
such
as
drugs
or
brain
damage
.


Changes
to
consciousness
also
can
cause
changes
to
perception
,
thinking
,
understanding
,
and
interpretations
of
the
world
.



Changes
in
consciousness
can
sometimes
be
a
sign
of
medical
conditions
or
they
may
even
be
a
sign
of
an
immediate
medical
emergency
.



For
example
,
sudden
changes
in
consciousness
might
be
a
sign
of
:

-
Aneurysm
---------------
When
to
Seek
Help

If
you
thinking
you
are
experiencing
changes
in
consciousness
,
talk
to
your
doctor
.


Sudden
changes
may
be
a
sign
of
a
medical
emergency
that
requires
immediate
attention
,
such
as
a
stroke
or
hemorrhage
.

 
---------------
treatment
before
problems
get
worse
.




History
of
Consciousness


For
thousands
of
years
,
the
study
of
human
consciousness
was
largely
the
work
of
philosophers
.


The
French
philosopher
Rene
Descartes
introduced
the
concept
of
mind-body
dualism
or
the
idea
that
while
the
mind
and
---------------
observers
would
carefully
inspect
the
contents
of
their
own
minds
.


Obviously
,
this
was
a
very
subjective
process
,
but
it
helped
inspire
further
research
on
the
scientific
study
of
consciousness
.



The
American
psychologist
William
James
compared
consciousness
to
a
stream—unbroken
and
continuous
despite
constant
shifts
and
changes
.


Psychoanalyst
Sigmund
Freud
focused
on
understanding
the
importance
of
---------------
While
the
focus
of
much
of
the
research
in
psychology
shifted
to
purely
observable
behaviors
during
the
first
half
of
the
20th
century
,
research
on
human
consciousness
has
grown
tremendously
since
the
1950s
.




Theories
of
Consciousness


One
of
the
problems
with
the
study
of
consciousness
is
the
lack
of
a
universally
accepted
operational
definition
.


Descartes
proposed
the
idea
of
cogito
ergo
sum
("I
think
,
therefore
I
am")
,
which
suggested
that
the
very
act
of
thinking
demonstrates
the
reality
of
one’s
existence
and
consciousness
.



Today
,
consciousness
is
generally
defined
as
an
awareness
of
yourself
and
the
world
.


However
,
there
are
still
debates
about
the
different
aspects
of
this
awareness
.



Research
on
consciousness
has
focused
on
understanding
the
neuroscience
behind
our
conscious
experiences
.


Scientists
have
even
utilized
brain-scanning
technology
to
seek
out
specific
neurons
that
might
be
linked
to
different
conscious
events
.


Modern
researchers
have
proposed
two
major
theories
of
consciousness
:
integrated
information
theory
and
global
workspace
theory
.




Integrated
Information
Theory


This
approach
looks
at
consciousness
by
learning
more
about
the
physical
processes
that
underlie
our
conscious
experiences
.


The
theory
attempts
to
create
a
measure
of
the
integrated
information
that
forms
consciousness
.


The
quality
of
an
organism’s
consciousness
is
represented
by
the
level
of
integration
.



---------------
integrated
information
theory
focuses
more
on
identifying
whether
an
organism
is
conscious
,
the
global
workspace
theory
offers
a
much
broader
approach
to
understanding
how
consciousness
works
.



The
Different
States
of
Consciousness


Summary


While
consciousness
has
intrigued
philosophers
and
scientists
for
thousands
of
years
,
experts
clearly
have
a
long
way
to
go
in
our
understanding
of
the
concept
.


Researchers
continue
to
explore
the
different
bases
of
consciousness
including
the
physical
,
social
,
cultural
,
and
psychological
influences
that
contribute
to
our
conscious
awareness
.

How

Key
points

-
Consciousness
is
the
active
and
subjective
experiencing
aspect
of
an

experience
.


-
Consciousness
is
what
transforms
a
biochemical
state
into
an

experience
.


-
Although
we
have
mapped
brain
activity
to
specific
conscious
---------------

experiences
.



Consciousness
is
what
we
are
most
familiar
with
.


Feeling
the
sun
'
s
warmth
on
our
face
,
the
joy
of
seeing
someone
we
love
,
or
the
thrill
of
being
on
a
rollercoaster—every
single
experience
we
ever
had
,
from
sensations
to
thoughts
and
emotions
,
is
linked
to
consciousness
.


It
seems
paradoxical
,
but
despite
being
at
the
centre
of
every
experience
,
consciousness
is
difficult
to
define
and
still
poorly
understood
scientifically
.



We
know
more
about
distant
galaxies
and
the
deepest
ocean
regions
than
we
do
about
our
consciousness
.


Even
though
consciousness
has
been
discussed
by
philosophers
for
millennia
and
has
become
an
active
and
thriving
field
of
scientific
research
,
it
remains
largely
a
mystery–but
---------------
intimately
acquainted
with
.



So
,
what
exactly
is
consciousness
?


Many
have
tried
to
answer
this
seemingly
simple
question
(I
will
cover
most
of
the
influential
views
on
this
blog)
,
but
a
universally
agreed-upon
definition
still
seems
---------------
something
extraordinary
happens
:
The
biological
signals
trigger
a
subjective
conscious
experience
.


We
still
don’t
know
much
about
how
or
why
this
happens
,
but
consciousness
lives
on
as
an
indisputable
aspect
of
our
minds
.


Although
mysterious
,
it
is
also
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
meaningful
aspects
of
our
human
experience
:
It
makes
life
worth
---------------
the
famous
unalienable
right
to
life
,
liberty
,
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
,
found
in

U
.

S
.


Declaration
of
Independence
,
are
based
on
the
human
capacity
to
have
experiences
.


Consciousness
is
the
basis
for
our
experiences
and
undergirds
all
of
this
.



In
its
most
basic
sense
,
consciousness
is
linked
to
experience
.


In
a
way
,
it
turns
a
state
of
the
world
or
a
specific
configuration
of
atoms
,
molecules
,
organs
,
and
everything
else
into
an
experience
.


Another
way
---------------
dogma
of
the
Ghost
in
the
Machine
.

”
A
majority
of
scientists
and
philosophers
reject
this
notion
.


However
,
it
does
mean
that
even
though
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
are
incredibly
useful
,
they
don’t
fully
explain
what
consciousness
is
.



Neuroscience
Essential
Reads
---------------

Anil
Seth
,
one
of
the
leading
researchers
in
this
field
,
suggests
that
the
ultimate
(or
what
he
calls
the
“real
question
of
consciousness”)
is
answering
why
a
particular
brain
activity
results
in
a
specific
conscious
experience
and
not
merely
establishing
that
it
does
(Seth
,
---------------
content
of
an
experience
is
truly
illusionary
(which
few
accept)
,
the
experience
itself
would
still
be
real
.


Any
philosophical
,
psychological
,
or
neurobiological
theory
of
consciousness
is
incomplete
without
a
full
account
of
experiences
,
which
brings
us
back
to
the
act
of
experiencing

So
,
what
exactly
is
consciousness

It
is
what
we
are
most
familiar
with
and
what
undergirds
every
perception
,
emotion

and
thought
we
have

At
the
same
time
,
it
is
an
elusive
notion
that
is
difficult
to
define

---------------
In
the
1990s
,
the
philosopher
David
Chalmers
described
this
inaccessibility
to
external
,
objective
scrutiny
as
the
“hard
problem”
of
consciousness
.



He
proposed
that
an
easier
task
for
scientists
to
tackle
would
be
its
---------------

Apart
from
curiosity
,
scientists
are
most
likely
motivated
to
discover
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
in
order
to
help
diagnose
and
treat
disorders
of
consciousness
,
such
as
persistent
vegetative
states
and
some
psychiatric
disorders
.



Three
dimensions
of
consciousness

Consciousness
has
several
distinct
dimensions
that
they
can
measure
.


Three
of
the
most
important
ones
are
:

---------------

These
three
dimensions
interact
to
produce
our
overall
state
of
consciousness
from
moment
to
moment
.


For
example
,
when
wide
awake
,
we
are
in
a
state
of
high
awareness
,
but
as
we
drift
off
to
sleep
at
night
,
both
wakefulness
and
awareness
subside
.


---------------
we
are
awake
.



In
a
similar
way
,
altered
states
of
consciousness
,
such
as
those
induced
by
psychedelic
drugs
or
low
oxygen
levels
,
involve
normal
levels
of
arousal
but
disorganized
sensory
experiences
.


---------------
and
awareness
that
are
even
lower
than
during
non-REM
sleep
.



Meanwhile
,
in
a
strange
hybrid
state
of
consciousness
known
as
unresponsive
wakefulness
syndrome
,
or
a
vegetative
state
,
patients
undergo
daily
cycles
of
sleep
and
wakefulness
,
but
without
showing
any
---------------
instructions
or
follow
a
moving
object
with
their
eyes
.



The
neural
correlates
of
consciousness

Patients
in
different
states
of
consciousness
have
provided
vital
clues
about
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
.



Techniques
such
as
functional
magnetic
resonance
imaging
(fMRI)
and

network
and
cortical
networks
that
are
involved
in
attention
.



In
disorders
of
consciousness
,
researchers
can
see
reduced
functional
connectivity
and
physical
damage
that
affects
the
connections
between
the
cortex
and
deep
brain
structures
.


---------------

Despite
advances
in
our
understanding
of
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
,
however
,
doctors
still
have
trouble
diagnosing
patients
who
are
unable
to
respond
to
questions
or
commands

“Consciousness
is

and

it
is

Three
gradients
of
consciousness

Dr
.


Huang
and
his
colleagues
looked
at
how
gradients
of
neural
activity
—
as
measured
by
fMRI
—
changed
with
the
three
main
dimensions
of
consciousness
:

-
arousability
or
wakefulness
---------------
system
and
the
somatomotor
cortex
,
which
helps
to
control
movement
.



“We
demonstrated
that
disruptions
of
human
consciousness
—
due
to
pharmacological
,
neuropathological
,
or
psychiatric
causes
—
are
associated
with
a
degradation
of
one
or
more
of
the
major
cortical
---------------
“According
to
our
work
,
cortical
gradient
measurements
have
the
potential
to
reduce
the
uncertainty
of
clinical
assessment
of
consciousness
in
those
patients
,”
he
added
.



Transcranial
magnetic
stimulation
---------------
Scientists
like
Dr
.


Huang
have
discovered
a
lot
about
its
neural
correlates
,
but
their
findings
do
not
shed
much
light
on
how
the
brain
generates
consciousness
—
the
“hard
problem”
.



Other
scientists
have
argued
that
to
learn
more
about
the
causes
of
consciousness
,
you
have
to
manipulate
brain
activity
and
see
what
happens

Theories
of
consciousness

Despite
advances
in
our
understanding
of
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
,
the
question
remains
:
How
does
consciousness
arise
from
brain
activity
?



---------------

The
communication
and
integration
of
information
between
brain
regions
is
at
the
heart
of
many
theories
of
consciousness
.



One
of
these
,
IIT
,
uses
a
complex
equation
to
calculate
an
entity’s
degree
of
consciousness
from
how
well
it
integrates
information
.



According
to
the
equation
,
even
inanimate
objects
such
as
rocks
and
teapots
have
a
glimmer
of
consciousness
.



This
is
in
keeping
with
the
philosophical
theory
of
panpsychism
,
which
proposes
that
consciousness
is
a
fundamental
property
of
all
physical
systems
.



How
it
feels
to
control
attention

Prof
.


Graziano
has
a
problem
with
all
these
theories
of
consciousness
.


He
argues
that
they
cannot
even
be
termed
theories
because
they
do
not
actually
explain
consciousness
,
they
only
describe
it
.



He
likens
this
to
the
difference
between
Newton’s
law
of
gravitation
,
---------------
theory
of
general
relativity
,
which
explains
what
gravity
actually
is
.



Prof
.


Graziano’s
own
theory
of
consciousness
,
the
attention
schema
theory
,
or
AST
,
does
not
claim
to
have
cracked
the
hard
problem
of
consciousness
,
but
instead
seeks
to
explain
why
we
believe
we
are
conscious
.



---------------

What
is
more
,
he
argues
that
the
attention
schema
leads
people
to
believe
that
they
have
an
internal
essence
—consciousness
—
that
allows
them
to
focus
their
attention
.



---------------
sense
of
selfhood
,
time
,
or
space
.



This
special
state
of
consciousness
has
provided
more
clues
about
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
.

Is
Consciousness
Part
of
the
Fabric
of
the
Universe
?



A
theory
called
panpsychism
proposes
that
consciousness
is
a
fundamental
aspect
of
reality

---------------
Galileo
recognized
that
not
everything
was
amenable
to
a
quantitative
approach
.


Such
things
as
colors
,
tastes
and
smells
“are
no
more
than
mere
names
,”
Galileo
declared
,
for
“they
reside
only
in
consciousness
.

”
These
qualities
aren’t
really
out
there
in
the
world
,
he
asserted
,
but
exist
only
in
the
minds
of
creatures
that
perceive
them
.


“Hence
if
the
---------------
Since
Galileo’s
time
the
physical
sciences
have
leaped
forward
,
explaining
the
workings
of
the
tiniest
quarks
to
the
largest
galaxy
clusters
.


But
explaining
things
that
reside
“only
in
consciousness”—the
red
of
a
sunset
,
say
,
or
the
bitter
taste
of
a
lemon—has
proven
far
more
difficult
.


Neuroscientists
have
identified
a
number
of
neural
correlates
of
consciousness—brain
states
associated
with
specific
mental
states—but
have
not
explained
how
matter
forms
minds
in
the
first
place
.


As
philosopher
Colin
McGinn
put
it
in
a
1989
paper
,
“Somehow
,
we
feel
,
the
water
of
the
physical
brain
is
turned
into
the
wine
of
consciousness
.

”
Philosopher
David
Chalmers
famously
dubbed
this
quandary the
“hard
problem”
of
consciousness
.

*

Scholars
recently
gathered
to
debate
the
problem
at
Marist
College
in
Poughkeepsie
,
N
.

Y
.


,
during
a
two-day
workshop
focused
on
an
idea
known
as panpsychism
.


The
concept
proposes
that
consciousness
is
a
fundamental
aspect
of
reality
,
like
mass
or
electrical
charge
.


The
idea
goes
back
to
antiquity—Plato
took
it
seriously—and
has
had
some
prominent
supporters
---------------
hall
with
floor-to-ceiling
windows
overlooking
the
Hudson
River
,
roughly
two
dozen
scholars
probed
the
possibility
that
perhaps
it’s
consciousness
all
the
way
down
.



Part
of
the
appeal
of
panpsychism
is
that
it
appears
to
provide
a
---------------
particles
might
be
somehow
aware
.


He
said
in
a
TED
Talk
that
a
photon
“might
have
some
element
of
raw
,
subjective
feeling
,
some
primitive
precursor
to
consciousness
.

”
Also
on
board
with
the
idea
is
neuroscientist
Christof
Koch
,
who
noted
in
his
2012
book
Consciousness
that
if
one
accepts
consciousness
as
a
real
phenomenon
that’s
not
dependent
on
any
particular
material—that
it’s
“substrate-independent
,”
as
philosophers
put
it—then
“it
is
a
simple
step
to
conclude
that
the
---------------

Yet
panpsychism
runs
counter
to
the
majority
view
in
both
the
physical
sciences
and
in
philosophy
that
treats
consciousness
as
an
emergent
phenomenon
,
something
that
arises
in
certain
complex
systems
,
such
as
human
brains
.


In
this
view
,
individual
neurons
are
not
conscious
,
but
---------------
theories
,
“most
physicists
think
about
experiments
,”
he
said
.


“I
think
they
should
be
thinking
,
‘Is
my
theory
compatible
with
consciousness
?

’—because
we
know
that’s
real
.

”

Many
philosophers
at
the
meeting
appeared
to
share
Goff’s
concern
that
physicalism
falters
when
it
comes
to
consciousness
.


“If
you
know
every
last
detail
about
my
brain
processes
,
you
still
wouldn’t
know
what
it’s
like
to
be
me
,”
says
Hedda
Hassel
Mørch
,
a
philosopher
at
Inland
Norway
---------------

But
panpsychism
attracts
many
critics
as
well
.


Some
point
out
that
it
doesn’t
explain
how
small
bits
of
consciousness
come
together
to
form
more
substantive
conscious
entities
.


Detractors
say
that
this
puzzle
,
known
as
the
“combination
problem
,”
amounts
to
panpsychism’s
own
version
---------------
divergence
of
their
worldviews
quickly
became
apparent
.


Goff
said
that
physicalism
has
led
“precisely
nowhere
,”
and
suggested
that
the
very
idea
of
trying
to
explain
consciousness
in
physical
terms
was
incoherent
.


Carroll
argued
that
physicalism
is
actually
doing
quite
well
and
that
although
consciousness
is
one
of
many
phenomena
that
can’t
be
inferred
from
the
goings-on
at
the
microscopic
level
,
it
is
nonetheless
a
real
,
emergent
feature
of
the
macroscopic
world
.


He
offered
the

the
black
and
white
room”)
,
as
well
as
the
“zombie”
argument
.


Both boil
down
to
the
same
key
question
:
Is
there
something
about
consciousness
that
cannot
be
accounted
for
by
physical
facts
alone
?


Much
of
the
rhetorical
ping-pong
between
Goff
and
Carroll
amounted
to
Goff
answering
yes
to
that
question
and
Carroll
answering
no
.


---------------
Paul
Draper
,
a
philosopher
at
Purdue
University
who
participated
via
Zoom
,
talked
about
a
subtly
different
idea
known
as
“psychological
ether
theory”—essentially
that
brains
don’t
produce
consciousness
but
rather
make
use
of
consciousness
.


In
this
view
,
consciousness
was
already
there
before
brains
existed
,
like
an
all-pervasive
ether
.


If
the
idea
is
correct
,
he
writes
,
“then
(in
all
likelihood)
God
exists
.

”
---------------
increasingly
popular
idea
in
physics
lately
that
space
and
time
may
not
be
fundamental
but
may
instead
be
emergent
phenomena
themselves
.

)
The
deeper
entity
related
to
consciousness
,
Hoffman
suggests
,
may
consist
of
“subjects
and
experiences”
that
he
says
“are
entities
beyond
spacetime
,
not
within
spacetime
.

”
He
developed
this
idea
in
a
2023
paper
entitled
“Fusions
of
Consciousness
.

Smolin

Institute

problem
.


“Critiquing
physicalism
on
the
basis
that
it
has
‘failed’
is
willful
mischaracterization
,”
he
says
.


“It’s
doing
just
fine
,
as
progress
in
consciousness
science
readily
attests
.

”
In
a
recently
published
article
in
the
Journal
of
Consciousness
Studies
,
Seth
adds
:
“Asserting
that
consciousness
is
fundamental
and
ubiquitous
does
nothing
to
shed
light
on
the
way
an
experience
of
blueness
is
the
way
it
is
,
and
not
some
other
way
.


Nor
does
it
explain
anything
about
the
possible
functions
of
consciousness
,
nor
why
consciousness
is
lost
in
states
such
as
dreamless
sleep
,
general
anaesthesia
,
and
coma
.

”

Even
those
who
lean
toward
panpsychism
sometimes
seem
hesitant
to
dive
into
the
deep
end
.


As
Garcia
put
it
,
in
spite
of
the
allure
of
a
universe
imbued
with
consciousness
,
“I
would
love
to
be
talked
out
of
it

The
universal
mind
,
or
universal
consciousness
,
is
a
metaphysical
concept
suggesting
an
underlying
essence
of
all
beings
and
becoming
in
the
universe
.


It
includes
the
being
and
becoming
that
occurred
in
the
universe
prior
to
the
emergence
of
the
concept
of
mind
,
a
term
that
more
appropriately
refers
to
the
organic
,
human
aspect
of
universal
consciousness
.


It
addresses
inorganic
being
and
becoming
and
the
interactions
that
occur
in
that
process
without
specific
reference
to
the
physical
and
chemical
laws
that
try
to
describe
those
interactions
.


Those
interactions
have
occurred
,
do
occur
,
and
continue
to
occur
.


Universal
consciousness
is
the
source
that
underlies
those
interactions
and
the
awareness
and
knowledge
they
imply
.

Is
Consciousness
Universal
?



Panpsychism
,
the
ancient
doctrine
that
consciousness
is
universal
,
offers
some
lessons
in
how
to
think
about
subjective
experience
today

---------------
would
God
resurrect
people
but
not
dogs
?


This
core
Christian
belief
in
human
exceptionalism
did
not
make
any
sense
to
me
.


Whatever
consciousness
and
mind
are
and
no
matter
how
they
relate
to
the
brain
and
the
rest
of
the
body
,
I
felt
that
the
same
principle
must
hold
for
people
and
dogs
and
,
by
extension
,
for
other
animals
as
well
.


---------------
and
its
emphasis
on
the
universal
nature
of
mind
.


Indeed
,
when
I
spent
a
week
with
His
Holiness
the
Dalai
Lama
earlier
in
2013
[see
“The
Brain
of
Buddha
,”
Consciousness
Redux
;
Scientific
American
Mind
,
July/August
2013]
,
I
noted
how
often
he
talked
about
the
need
to
reduce
the
suffering
of
“all
living
beings”
and
not
just
“all
people
.

”
My
readings
---------------
mice
,
whales
,
dogs
,
cats
and
monkeys—are
capable
of
sophisticated
,
learned
,
nonstereotyped
behaviors
that
would
be
associated
with
consciousness
if
a
human
were
to
carry
out
such
actions
.


Precursors
of
behaviors
thought
to
be
unique
to
people
are
found
in
many
species
.


For
instance
,
bees
are
capable
of
recognizing
specific
faces
from
---------------

Some
people
point
to
language
and
the
associated
benefits
as
being
the
unique
defining
feature
of
consciousness
.


Conveniently
,
this
viewpoint
rules
out
all
but
one
species
,
Homo
sapiens
(which
has
an
ineradicable
desire
to
come
out
on
top)
,
as
having
sentience
.


Yet
there
is
little
reason
to
deny
consciousness
to
animals
,
preverbal
infants
[see
“The
Conscious
Infant
,”
Consciousness
Redux
;
Scientific
American
Mind
,
September/October
2013]
or
patients
with
severe
aphasia
,
all
of
whom
are
mute
.


---------------
I
will
defend
a
narrowed
,
more
nuanced
view
:
namely
that
any
complex
system
,
as
defined
below
,
has
the
basic
attributes
of
mind
and
has
a
minimal
amount
of
consciousness
in
the
sense
that
it
feels
like
something
to
be
that
system
.


If
the
system
falls
apart
,
consciousness
ceases
to
be
;
it
doesn
'
t
feel
like
anything
to
be
a
broken
system
.


And
the
more
complex

the
larger
the
repertoire
of
conscious
---------------
hold
the
weight
of
philosophy
.


But
from
whence
does
this
experience
come
?


Materialists
invoke
something
they
call
emergentism
to
explain
how
consciousness
can
be
absent
in
simple
nervous
systems
and
emerge
as
their
complexity
increases
.


Consider
the
wetness
of
water
,
its
ability
to
maintain
contact
with
surfaces
.


It
is
a
consequence
of
intermolecular
---------------
conscious
states
to
be
bridged
by
bigger
brains
or
more
complex
neurons
.



A
more
principled
solution
is
to
assume
that
consciousness
is
a
basic
feature
of
certain
types
of
so-called
complex
systems
(defined
in
some
universal
,
mathematical
manner)
.


And
that
complex
systems
have
---------------
intrinsic
property
of
these
particles
.


Electrical
charge
does
not
emerge
from
noncharged
matter
.


It
is
the
same
,
goes
the
logic
,
with
consciousness
.


Consciousness
comes
with
organized
chunks
of
matter
.


It
is
immanent
in
the
organization
of
the
system
.


It
is
a
property
of
complex
entities
and
cannot
be
further
reduced
to
the
action
of
more
---------------
flaws
.


One
is
known
as
the
problem
of
aggregates
.


Philosopher
John
Searle
of
the
University
of
California
,
Berkeley
,
expressed
it
recently
:
“Consciousness
cannot
spread
over
the
universe
like
a
thin
veneer
of
jam
;
there
has
to
be
a
point
where
my
consciousness
ends
and
yours
begins
.

”
Indeed
,
if
consciousness
is
everywhere
,
why
should
it
not
animate
the
iPhone
,
the
Internet
or
the
United
States
of
America
?


Furthermore
,
panpsychism
does
not
explain
why
a
healthy
brain
is
---------------
conscious
experience
is
a
fundamental
aspect
of
reality
and
is
identical
to
a
particular
type
of
information—integrated
information
.


Consciousness
depends
on
a
physical
substrate
but
is
not
reducible
to
it
.


That
is
,
my
experience
of
seeing
an
aquamarine
blue
is
inexorably
linked
to
my
brain
but
is
different
from
my
brain
.


---------------
part
of
your
view
.


Whatever
information
you
are
conscious
of
is
wholly
and
completely
presented
to
your
mind
;
it
cannot
be
subdivided
.


Underlying
this
unity
of
consciousness
is
a
multitude
of
causal
interactions
among
the
relevant
parts
of
your
brain
.


If
parts
of
the
brain
become
fragmented
and
balkanized
,
as
occurs
in
deep
sleep
or
in
anesthesia
,
consciousness
fades
.



To
be
conscious
,
then
,
you
need
to
be
a
single
,
integrated
entity
with
a
---------------
extent
to
which
this
network
is
integrated
.


From
this
calculation
,
the
theory
derives
a
single
number
,
&PHgr
(pronounced
“fi”)
[see
“A
Theory
of
Consciousness
,”
Consciousness
Redux
;
Scientific
American
Mind
,
July/August
2009]
.


Measured
in
bits
,
&PHgr
denotes
the
size
of
the
conscious
repertoire
associated
with
the
network
of
causally
interacting
---------------
low
.


If
the
organism
has
many
neurons
and
is
richly
endowed
with
synaptic
connections
,
&PHgr
will
be
high
.


Basically
,
&PHgr
captures
the
quantity
of
consciousness
.


The
quality
of
any
one
experience—the
way
in
which
red
feels
different
from
blue
and
a
color
is
perceived
differently
from
a
tone—is
conveyed
by
the
informational
geometry
associated
with
---------------

Integrated
information
makes
very
specific
predictions
about
which
brain
circuits
are
involved
in
consciousness
and
which
ones
are
peripheral
players
(even
though
they
might
contain
many
more
neurons
,
their
anatomical
wiring
differs)
.


The
theory
has
most
recently
been
used
to
build
a
consciousness
meter
to
assess
,
in
a
quantitative
manner
,
the
extent
to
which
anesthetized
subjects
or
severely
brain-injured
patients
,
such
as
Terri
Schiavo
,
who
died
in
Florida
in
2005
,
are
truly
not
conscious
or
do
have
some
conscious
experiences
but
are
unable
to
signal
their
pain
and
discomfort
to
their
loved
ones

Historical
use
of
collective
consciousness

[edit]
---------------
The
term
was
introduced
by
the
French
sociologist
Émile
Durkheim
in
his
The
Division
of
Labour
in
Society
in
1893
.


The
French
word
conscience
generally
means
"conscience"
,
"consciousness"
,
"awareness"
,^([6])
or
"perception"
.

^([7])

definitions
,

of
Durkheim

he
describes

He
doesn’t
call
this
collective
consciousness
,
but
‘âme
de
la
foule’
(soul
of
the
crowd)
.

^([10])
This
term
returns
in
Sigmund
Freud’s
book
about
mass
psychology
and
essentially
overlaps
with
Durkheims
concept
of
collective
consciousness

In
societies

the
contents
of
an
individual

largely
shared

The

the

of
a
society
forms
a

system
with
a
life
of

It
can

be
termed
the
collective
or
common
consciousness

—
Émile
Durkheim^([11])
---------------
In
Suicide
,
Durkheim
developed
the
concept
of
anomie
to
refer
to
the
social
rather
than
individual
causes
of
suicide
.


This
relates
to
the
concept
of
collective
consciousness
,
as
if
there
is
a
lack
of
integration
or
solidarity
in
society
then
suicide
rates
will
be
higher

Antonio
Gramsci
states
,
“A
collective
consciousness
,
which
is
to
say
a
living
organism
,
is
formed
only
after
the
unification
of
the
multiplicity
through
friction
on
the
part
of
the
individuals
;
nor
can
one
say
that
‘silence’
is
not
a
multiplicity
.

”^([13])
A
form
of
collective
consciousness
can
be
formed
from
Gramsci
'
s
conception
that
the
presence
of
a
hegemony
can
mobilize
the
collective
consciousness
of
those
oppressed
by
the
ruling
ideas
of
society
,
or
the
ruling
hegemony
.


Collective
consciousness
can
refer
to
a
multitude
of
different
individual
forms
of
consciousness
coalescing
into
a
greater
whole
.


In
Gramsci
'
s
view
,
a
unified
whole
is
composed
of
solidarity
among
its
different
constituent
parts
,
and
therefore
,
this
whole
cannot
be
uniformly
the
same
.


The
unified
whole
can
embrace
different
forms
of
consciousness
(or
individual
experiences
of
social
reality)
,
which
coexist
to
reflect
the
different
experiences
of
the
marginalized
peoples
in
a
given
society
.


This
agrees
with
Gramsci
'
s
theory
of
Marxism
and
class
struggle
applied
to
cultural
contexts
.


Cultural
Marxism
(as
distinguished
from
the
right-wing
use
of
the
term)
embodies
the
concept
of
collective
consciousness
.


It
incorporates
social
movements
that
are
based
on
some
sort
of
collective
identity
;
these
identities
can
include
,
for
instance
,
gender
,
sexual
orientation
,
race
,
and
ability
,
and
can
be
---------------
relationship
between
State
and
society
that
in
Gramsci
'
s
view
emerged
during
the
age
of
mass
politics
.

”^([14])
Collective
organisms
can
express
collective
consciousness
.


Whether
this
form
of
expression
finds
itself
in
the
realm
of
the
state
or
the
realm
of
society
is
up
to
the
direction
that
the
subjects
take
in
expressing
their
collective
consciousness
.


In
Gramsci
'
s
Prison
Notebooks
,
the
ongoing
conflict
between
civil
society
,
the
bureaucracy
,
and
the
state
necessitates
the
emergence
of
a
collective
consciousness
that
can
often
act
as
an
intermediary
between
these
different
realms
.


The
public
organizations
of
protest
,
such
as
labor
unions
and
anti-war
organizations
,
are
vehicles
that
can
unite
multiple
types
of
collective
consciousness
.


Although
identity-based
movements
are
necessary
for
the
progress
of
democracy
and
can
generate
collective
consciousness
,
they
cannot
completely
do
so
without
a
unifying
framework
.


This
is
why
anti-war
and
labor
movements
provide
an
avenue
that
has
united
various
social
movements
under
the
banner
of
a
multiple
collective
consciousness
.


This
is
also
why
future
social
movements
need
to
have
an
ethos
of
collective
consciousness
if
they
are
to
succeed
in
the
long-term
.

Knowledge
in
a
sociological
sense

Collective
consciousness
also
reflects
social
realities
,
and
sociological
knowledge
can
be
gained
through
the
adoption
of
a
collective
consciousness
.


Many
different
disciplines
such
as
philosophy
and
literature
examine
collective
consciousness
from
different
lenses
.


These
different
disciplines
reach
a
similar
understanding
of
a
collective
consciousness
despite
their
different
approaches
to
the
subject
.


The
inherent
humanness
in
the
idea
of
collective

a

human

materialism
as

by
human
beings

It
is
suggested
that

to
the
different

consciousness
between
nations
.


This
illustrates
that
differences
in
collective
consciousness
can
have
practical
significance
.



According
to
a
theory
,
the
character
of
collective
consciousness
depends
on
the
type
of
mnemonic
encoding
used
within
a
group
(Tsoukalas

Wolfgang
Ernst
examines

specifically
collective
oral

traditions
.


"Current

There

Understanding

In
the
tapestry
of
collective
consciousness

we
weave
our
individual
stories
into
a
greater
narrative
of
unity

What

the

theory
?



What
is
Durkheim
'
s
theory
of
collective
consciousness
?



Émile
Durkheim
,
a
pioneering
figure
in
sociology
,
coined
the
French
term
"conscience
collective
.

"
His
idea
of
collective
consciousness
refers
to
beliefs
and
sentiments
common
to
average
members
of
society
,
forming
a
determinate
system
that
has
its
own
life
.


According
to
Durkheim
,
this
---------------
light
on
how
societies
maintain
cohesion
and
solidarity
.



What
did
Carl
Jung
mean
by
collective
consciousness
?



Carl
Jung
,
the
pioneering
Swiss
psychiatrist
and
psychoanalyst
,
expanded
upon
prevailing
notions
of
shared
human
experience
.


While
earlier
thinkers
like
Durkheim
had
raised
the
subject
of
this
"collective
consciousness"
—
a
shared
set
of
beliefs
,
values
,
and
societal
norms
that
bind
communities
together
,
Jung
ventured
deeper
.

the

"collective
consciousness"
and
"collective
unconscious"
become
crucial
.



Durkheim
'
s
collective
consciousness
captures
the
conscious
agreements
that
make
societal
cohesion
possible
—
the
realm
of
shared
traditions
,
laws
,
and
cultural
norms
.



Building
upon
this
understanding
,
Jung
proposed
that
the
collective
unconscious
lies
beneath
this
layer
of
shared
consciousness
.

 
This
realm
is
not
about
societal
agreements
but
taps
into
innate
,
universal
symbols
and
themes
that
inform
societal
structures
and
animate
our
dreams

Similarly
,
studies
have
highlighted
instances
of
collective
consciousness
during
advanced
states
of
group
meditation
and
within
oral
cultures
,
such
as
the
Australian
Aborigines
and
the
San
people
of
Africa
.


---------------
emotions
.


There
is
speculation
that
these
neurons
could
be
central
in
fostering
collective
experiences
,
playing
a
significant
role
in
the
emergence
of
language
and
reflective
self-consciousness
.

The
Concept
of
Collective
Consciousness

What
It
Is
and
How
It
Holds
Society
Together
---------------
Updated
on
January
16
,
2019

Collective
consciousness
(sometimes
collective
conscience
or
conscious)
is
a
fundamental
sociological
concept
that
refers
to
the
set
of
shared
beliefs
,
ideas
,
attitudes
,
and
knowledge
that
are
common
to
a
social
group
or
society
.


The
collective
consciousness
informs
our
sense
of
belonging
and
identity
,
and
our
behavior
.


Founding
sociologist
Émile
Durkheim
developed
this
concept
to
explain
how
unique
individuals
are
bound
together
into
collective
units
like
social
groups
and
societies
.




How
Collective
Consciousness
Holds
Society
Together


What
is
it
that
holds
society
together
?


This
was
the
central
question
---------------
because
unique
individuals
feel
a
sense
of
solidarity
with
each
other
.


This
is
why
we
can
form
collectives
and
work
together
to
achieve
community
and
functional
societies
.


The
collective
consciousness
,
or conscience
collective as
he
wrote
it
in
French
,
is
the
source
of
this
solidarity
.



Durkheim
first
introduced
his
theory
of
the
collective
consciousness
in
his
1893
book
"The
Division
of
Labor
in
Society"
.


(Later
,
he
would
also
rely
on
the
concept
in
other
books
,
including
"Rules
of
the
Sociological
---------------
and
sentiments
common
to
the
average
members
of
a
society
.

"
Durkheim
observed
that
in
traditional
or
primitive
societies
, religious
symbols
,
discourse
,
beliefs
,
and
rituals
fostered
the
collective
consciousness
.


In
such
cases
,
where
social
groups
were
quite
homogenous
(not
distinct
by
race
or
class
,
for
example)
,
the
collective
consciousness
resulted
in
what
Durkheim
termed
a
"mechanical
solidarity"
—
in
effect
an
automatic
binding
together
of
people
into
a
collective
through
their
shared
---------------
others
in
order
to
allow
for
a
society
to
function
.


In
cases
such
as
these
,
religion
still
played
an
important
role
in
producing
collective
consciousness
among
groups
of
people
affiliated
with
various
religions
,
but
other
social
institutions
and
structures
would
also
work
to
produce
the
collective
consciousness
necessary
for
this
more
complex
form
of
solidarity
,
and
rituals
outside
of
religion
would
play
important
roles
in
reaffirming
it
.




Social
Institutions
Produce
Collective
Consciousness


These
other
institutions
include
the
state
(which
fosters
patriotism
and
---------------

In
either
case
—
primitive
or
modern
societies
—
collective
consciousness
is
something
"common
to
the
whole
of
society
,"
as
Durkheim
put
it
.


It
is
not
an
individual
condition
or
phenomenon
,
but
a
social
one
.


As
a
social
phenomenon
,
it
is
"diffused
across
society
as
a
whole
,"
and
"has
a
life
of
its
own
.

"
It
is
through
collective
consciousness
that
values
,
beliefs
,
and
traditions
can
be
passed
down
through
generations
.


Though
individual
people
live
and
die
,
this
collection
of
intangible
---------------
our
social
institutions
and
thus
exist
independent
of
individual
people
.



Most
important
to
understand
is
that
collective
consciousness
is
the
result
of
social
forces
that
are
external
to
the
individual
,
that
course
through
society
,
and
that
work
together
to
create
the
social
phenomenon
of
the
shared
set
of
beliefs
,
values
,
and
ideas
that
compose
it
.


We
,
as
individuals
,
internalize
these
and make
the
collective
consciousness
a
reality
by
doing
so
,
and
we
reaffirm
and
reproduce
it
by
living
in
ways
that
reflect
it
.

Consciousness
shared
by
individuals
within
a
society

Social
consciousness
or
social
awareness
,
is
collective
consciousness
shared
by
individuals
within
a
society
.

^([1])

Social
consciousness
is
linked
to
the
collective
self-awareness
and
experience
of
collectively
shared
social
identity
.

^([2])
From
this
viewpoint
,
social
consciousness
denotes
conscious
awareness
of
being
part
of
an
interrelated
community
of
others
.


The
“we
feeling”
or
the
“sense
of
us”
may
be
experienced
in
members
of
various
cultures
and
social
groups
.


By
the
experience
of
collectively
shared
social
identity
,
individuals
may
experience
social
unity
.


Social
consciousness
may
also
stimulate
working
towards
a
common
goal
.



According
to
Karl
Marx
,
human
beings
enter
into
certain
productive
,
or
economic
,
relations
and
these
relations
lead
to
a
form
of
social
consciousness
.

^([1])
Marx
said
:


"In
the
social
production
of
their
life
,
men
enter
into
definite
---------------

—
the
real
foundation
,
on
which
rises
a
legal
and
political

superstructure
and
to
which
correspond
definite
forms
of
social

consciousness
.


The
mode
of
production
of
material
life
determines
the

social
,
political
and
intellectual
life
process
in
general
.


It
is
not

the
consciousness
of
men
that
determines
their
being
,
but
,
on
the

contrary
,
their
social
being
that
determines
their

consciousness
.

In
Marxism
,
class
consciousness
is
the
set
of
beliefs
that
persons
hold
regarding
their
social
class
or
economic
rank
in
society
,
the
structure
of
their
class
,
and
their
common
class
interests
.

^([1][2])
According
to
Karl
Marx
,
class
consciousness
is
an
awareness
that
is
key
to
sparking
a
revolution
which
would
"create
a
dictatorship
of
the
proletariat
,
transforming
it
from
a
wage-earning
,
propertyless
mass
into
the
ruling
class"
.

^([3])

Although
Marxists
tend
to
focus
on
class
consciousness
(or
its
absence)
among
the
proletariat
,
the
upper
classes
in
society
can
also
think
and
act
in
a
class-conscious
way
.


As
Leonard
Fein
pointed
out
,
"The
very
rich
have
been
well
aware
of
their
class
privilege
and
have
labored
mightily
to
protect
and
defend
it"
.

^([4][5])
For
example
,
Warren
Buffett
has
demonstrated
class
consciousness
:
"There
'
s
class
warfare
,
all
right
.


.


.


but
it
'
s
my
class
,
the
rich
class
,
that
'
s
making
war
,
and
we
'
re
winning
.

"^([6])
---------------
reinforced
by
the
new
gentry
who
owed
their
success
to
commerce
,
industry
,
and
the
professions
,
evolved
into
an

'
upper
class
'

(its
consciousness
formed
in
large
part
by
the
Public
Schools
and
Universities)
which
tenaciously
maintained
control
over
the
political
system
,
depriving
not
only
the
working
classes
but
the
middle
classes
of
---------------
to
become
more
acutely
conscious
of
its
position
in
the
hierarchy
.

^([7])

While
Karl
Marx
rarely
used
the
term
"class
consciousness"
,
he
did
make
the
distinction
between
"class
in
itself"
,
which
is
defined
as
a
stratum
of
society
sharing
common
grievances
and
a
unified
perspective
;
and
a
---------------
education
,
occupation
,
or
status
.

^([9][10][11])

Whereas
Marx
believed
the
working
class
would
gain
class
consciousness
as
a
result
of
its
experience
of
exploitation
,
later
orthodox
Marxism
,
in
particular
as
formulated
by
Vladimir
Lenin
,
argued
that
the
working
class
,
by
itself
,
could
only
develop
"trade
union
consciousness"
,
which
Lenin
characterized
in
What
Is
to
Be
Done
?


as
"the
conviction
that
it
is
necessary
to
combine
in
unions
,
fight
the
employers
,
and
strive
to
---------------
overcome
this
(in
Lenin
'
s
opinion)
limited
worldview
,
a
vanguard
party
of
the
most
politically
advanced
section
of
the
working
class
was
needed
to
help
replace
trade
union
consciousness
with
class
consciousness
.

^([13][14])

Criticism
---------------

The
Polish
political
philosopher
Leszek
Kolakowski
disputed
the
notion
that
class
consciousness
could
be
instilled
from
outside
by
a
vanguard
party
.


In
Main
Currents
of
Marxism
and
his
other
writings
,
he
stated
that
in
order
to
achieve
a
unity
of
theory
and
praxis
,
theory
must
not
---------------
"expression
of
the
revolutionary
process
itself"
.


In
turn
,
a
theory
which
has
as
its
goal
helping
the
proletariat
achieve
class
consciousness
must
first
be
an
"objective
theory
of
class
consciousness"
.


However
,
theory
in
itself
is
insufficient
,
and
ultimately
relies
on
the
struggle
of
humankind
and
of
the
proletariat
for
consciousness
:
the
"objective
theory
of
class
consciousness
is
only
the
theory
of
its
objective
possibility"
.

^([15][16])

Austrian
School
economist
Ludwig
von
Mises
asserted
that
"Marx
confus[ed]
the
notions
of
caste
and
class"
.


Mises
allowed
that
class
consciousness
and
the
associated
class
struggle
were
valid
concepts
in
some
circumstances
where
rigid
social
castes
exist

became
the
peculiar
ideological
instrument
to
justify
a

new
idea
of
the
party
of
manipulators
.


Since
the
working
class
is
in

principle
incapable
of
articulating
theoretically
its
consciousness
,

it
is
possible
and
even
necessary
that
the
"genuine"
theoretical

consciousness
of
the
working
class
should
be
incarnated
in
a

political
organism
that
could
consider
itself
the
carrier
of
this

consciousness
regardless
of
what
the
"empirical"
working
class

thought
about
it
,
given
that
the
"empirical"
consciousness
of
this

class
is
irrelevant
in
defining
who
in
a
given
moment
represents
its

interest
.


This
is
why
the
theory
of
class
consciousness
instilled

from
outside
and
the
whole
idea
of
scientific
socialism
so
conceived

served
to
justify
the
fact
that
in
all
kinds
of
political
activity

and
later
in
the
exercise
of
political
power
,
the
working
class
may

be

must
be
replaced
by
the
political
apparatus
which
is
the

vehicle
of
its
consciousness
at
the
highest
level
.

and

---------------
the
division
of
society
into
classes
is
determined
by
position
within
the
process
of
production
.


But
what
,
then
,
is
the
meaning
of
class
consciousness
?


The
question
at
once
branches
out
into
a
series
of
closely
interrelated
problems
.


First
of
all
,
how
are
we
to
understand
class
consciousness
(in
theory)
?


Second
,
what
is
the
(practical)
function
of
class
consciousness
,
so
understood
,
in
the
context
of
the
class
struggle
?


This
leads
to
the
further
question
:
is
the
problem
of
class
consciousness
a
‘general’
sociological
problem
or
does
it
mean
one
thing
for
the
proletariat
and
another
for
every
other
class
to
have
emerged
hitherto
?


And
lastly
,
is
class
consciousness
homogeneous
in
nature
and
function
or
can
we
discern
different
gradations
and
levels
in
it
?


And
if
so
,
what
are
their
practical
implications
for
the
class
---------------
scientific
Marxism
consists
,
then
,
in
the
realisation
that
the
real
motor
forces
of
history
are
independent
of
man’s
(psychological)
consciousness
of
them
.



At
a
more
primitive
stage
of
knowledge
this
independence
takes
the
form
---------------
political
theory
of
classical
German
philosophy
and
in
the
economic
theory
of
Adam
Smith
and
Ricardo
.


Marx
opposes
to
them
a
critical
philosophy
,
a
theory
of
theory
and
a
consciousness
of
consciousness
.


This
critical
philosophy
implies
above
all
historical
criticism
.


It
dissolves
the
rigid
,
unhistorical
,
natural
appearance
of
social
---------------

It
might
look
as
though
by
dissolving
the
dilemma
in
this
manner
we
were
denying
consciousness
any
decisive
role
in
the
process
of
history
.


It
is
true
that
the
conscious
reflexes
of
the
different
stages
of
economic
growth
remain
historical
facts
of
great
importance
;
it
is
true
that
---------------
does
not
deny
that
men
perform
their
historical
deeds
themselves
and
that
they
do
so
consciously
.


But
as
Engels
emphasises
in
a
letter
to
Mehring
,
^([9])
this
consciousness
is
false
.


However
,
the
dialectical
method
does
not
permit
us
simply
to
proclaim
the
‘falseness’
of
this
consciousness
and
to
persist
in
an
inflexible
confrontation
of
true
and
false
.


On
the
contrary
,
it
requires
us
to
investigate
this
‘false
consciousness’
concretely
as
an
aspect
of
the
historical
totality
and
as
a
stage
in
the
historical
process
.



---------------
(’individual’
here
can
refer
to
an
individual
man
,
class
or
people)
and
in
his
empirically
given
(and
hence
psychological
or
mass-psychological)
consciousness
.


And
just
when
they
imagine
that
they
have
discovered
the
most
concrete
thing
of
all
:
society
as
a
concrete
totality
,
the
system
of
production
at
a
given
point
in
history
and
the
resulting
division
of
---------------

Concrete
analysis
means
then
:
the
relation
to
society
as
a
whole
.


For
only
when
this
relation
is
established
does
the
consciousness
of
their
existence
that
men
have
at
any
given
time
emerge
in
all
its
essential
characteristics
.


It
appears
,
on
the
one
hand
,
as
something
which
is
---------------
same
time
,
objectively
,
it
by-passes
the
essence
of
the
evolution
of
society
and
fails
to
pinpoint
it
and
express
it
adequately
.


That
is
to
say
,
objectively
,
it
appears
as
a
‘false
consciousness’
.


On
the
other
hand
,
we
may
see
the
same
consciousness
as
something
which
fails
subjectively
to
reach
its
self-appointed
goals
,
while
furthering
and
realising
the
objective
aims
of
society
of
which
it
is
ignorant
and
which
it
did
not
choose
.



This
twofold
dialectical
determination
of
‘false
consciousness’
constitutes
an
analysis
far
removed
from
the
naive
description
of
what
men
in
fact
thought
,
felt
and
wanted
at
any
moment
in
history
and
from
---------------
genuine
historical
analysis
.


The
relation
with
concrete
totality
and
the
dialectical
determinants
arising
from
it
transcend
pure
description
and
yield
the
category
of
objective
possibility
.


By
relating
consciousness
to
the
whole
of
society
it
becomes
possible
to
infer
the
thoughts
and
feelings
which
men
would
have
in
a
particular
situation
if
they
were
---------------
distinguished
basic
types
whose
characteristics
are
determined
by
the
types
of
position
available
in
the
process
of
production
.


Now
class
consciousness
consists
in
fact
of
the
appropriate
and
rational
reactions
‘imputed’
[zugerechnet]
to
a
particular
typical
position
in
the
process
of
production
.

^([11])
This
consciousness
is
,
therefore
,
neither
the
sum
nor
the
average
of
what
is
thought
or
felt
by
the
single
individuals
who
make
up
the
class
.


And
yet
the
historically
significant
actions
of
the
class
as
a
whole
are
determined
in
the
last
resort
by
this
consciousness
and
not
by
the
thought
of
the
individual
–
and
these
actions
can
be
understood
only
by
reference
to
this
consciousness
.



This
analysis
establishes
right
from
the
start
the
distance
that
separates
class
consciousness
from
the
empirically
given
,
and
from
the
psychologically
describable
and
explicable
ideas
which
men
form
about
their
situation
in
life
.


But
it
is
not
enough
just
to
state
that
this
---------------
produce
qualitative
distinctions
.


And
we
must
discover
,
secondly
,
the
practical
significance
of
these
different
possible
relations
between
the
objective
economic
totality
,
the
imputed
class
consciousness
and
the
real
,
psychological
thoughts
of
men
about
their
lives
.


We
must
discover
,
in
short
,
the
practical
,
historical
function
of
class
consciousness
.



Only
after
such
preparatory
formulations
can
we
begin
to
exploit
the
---------------
for
them
by
the
economic
structure
of
society
and
establishing
their
position
in
it
.


^([12])
Regarded
abstractly
and
formally
,
then
,
class
consciousness
implies
a
class-conditioned
unconsciousness
of
ones
own
socio-historical
and
economic
condition
.


^([13])
This
condition
is
given
as
a
definite
structural
relation
,
a
definite
formal
nexus
which
appears
---------------

For
a
class
to
be
ripe
for
hegemony
means
that
its
interests
and
consciousness
enable
it
to
organise
the
whole
of
society
in
accordance
with
those
interests
.


The
crucial
question
in
every
class
struggle
is
this
:
which
class
possesses
this
capacity
and
this
consciousness
at
the
decisive
moment
?


This
does
not
preclude
the
use
of
force
.


It
does
not
mean
that
the
class-interests
destined
to
prevail
and
thus
to
uphold
the
---------------
about
by
the
most
ruthless
use
of
force
(as
e
.

g
.


the
primitive
accumulation
of
capital)
.


But
it
often
turns
out
that
questions
of
class
consciousness
prove
to
be
decisive
in
just
those
situations
where
force
is
unavoidable
and
where
classes
are
locked
in
a
life-and-death-struggle
.


Thus
the
noted
Hungarian
Marxist
Erwin
Szabo
is
---------------
the
peasants’
revolt
was
suppressed
only
by
the
ruthless
use
of
force
and
that
its
defeat
was
not
grounded
in
socioeconomic
factors
and
in
the
class
consciousness
of
the
peasants
.


He
overlooks
the
fact
that
the
deepest
reason
for
the
weakness
of
the
peasantry
and
the
superior
strength
of
the
princes
is
to
be
sought
in
class
consciousness
.


Even
the
most
cursory
student
of
the
military
aspects
of
the
Peasants’
War
can
easily
convince
himself
of
this
.



It
must
not
be
thought
,
however
,
that
all
classes
ripe
for
hegemony
have
a
class
consciousness
with
the
same
inner
structure
.


Everything
hinges
on
the
extent
to
which
they
can
become
conscious
of
the
actions
they
need
to
perform
in
order
to
obtain
and
organise
power
.


The
question
then
becomes
:
how
far
does
the
class
concerned
perform
the
actions
history
has
imposed
on
it
‘consciously’
or
‘unconsciously’
?


And
is
that
consciousness
‘true’
or
‘false’
.


These
distinctions
are
by
no
means
academic
.


Quite
apart
from
problems
of
culture
where
such
fissures
and
dissonances
are
crucial
,
in
all
practical
matters
too
the
fate
of
a
class
depends
on
its
ability
to
elucidate
and
solve
the
problems
with
which
history
confronts
it
.


And
here
it
becomes
transparently
obvious
that
class
consciousness
is
concerned
neither
with
the
thoughts
of
individuals
,
however
advanced
,
nor
with
the
state
of
scientific
knowledge
.


For
example
,
it
is
quite
clear
that
ancient
society
was
---------------
a
class
standpoint
other
than
that
of
the
bourgeoisie
.


And
no
class
can
do
that
–
unless
it
is
willing
to
abdicate
its
power
freely
.


Thus
the
barrier
which
converts
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
into
‘false’
consciousness
is
objective
;
it
is
the
class
situation
itself
.


It
is
the
objective
result
of
the
economic
set-up
,
and
is
neither
arbitrary
,
subjective
nor
psychological
.


The
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
may
well
be
able
to
reflect
all
the
problems
of
organisation
entailed
by
its
hegemony
and
by
the
capitalist
transformation
and
---------------
feudalism
or
even
the
mercantilism
of
the
transitional
period
,
but
by
an
internal
dialectical
twist
they
became
“natural
laws
based
on
the
unconsciousness
of
those
who
are
involved
in
them”
.


^([15])

It
would
be
beyond
the
scope
of
these
pages
to
advance
further
and
attempt
to
construct
a
historical
and
systematic
typology
of
the
possible
degrees
of
class
consciousness
.


That
would
require
–
in
the
first
instance
–
an
exact
study
of
the
point
in
the
total
process
of
production
at
which
the
interests
of
the
various
classes
are
most
---------------
totality
that
is
then
achieved
?


How
far
does
it
really
embrace
the
true
totality
of
production
?


It
is
quite
evident
that
the
quality
and
structure
of
class
consciousness
must
be
very
different
if
,
e
.

g
.


it
remains
stationary
at
the
separation
of
consumption
from
production
(as
with
the
Roman
Lumpenproletariat)
or
if
it
represents
the
formation
of
---------------
cannot
embark
on
a
systematic
typology
of
the
various
points
of
view
it
can
be
seen
from
the
foregoing
that
these
specimens
of
‘false’
consciousness
differ
from
each
other
both
qualitatively
,
structurally
and
in
a
manner
that
is
crucial
for
the
activity
of
the
classes
in
society
.


---------------
It
follows
from
the
above
that
for
pre-capitalist
epochs
and
for
the
behaviour
of
many
strata
within
capitalism
whose
economic
roots
lie
in
pre-capitalism
,
class
consciousness
is
unable
to
achieve
complete
clarity
and
to
influence
the
course
of
history
consciously
.



---------------
only
question
that
arises
is
whether
this
unity
enables
the
individual
sectors
of
society
to
relate
to
society
as
a
whole
in
such
a
way
that
their
imputed
consciousness
can
assume
an
economic
form
.


Marx
emphasises
^([19])
that
in
Greece
and
Rome
the
class
struggle
“chiefly
took
the
form
of
a
conflict
between
debtors
and
creditors”
.


But
he
also
makes
the
---------------
despite
this
conflict
between
juridical
form
and
economic
content
,
the
juridical
(privilege-creating)
forms
retain
a
great
and
often
absolutely
crucial
importance
for
the
consciousness
of
estates
in
the
process
of
disintegration
.


For
the
form
of
the
estates
conceals
the
connection
between
the
–
real
but
‘unconscious’
–
economic
existence
of
the
estate
and
the
economic
totality
of
society
.


It
fixates
consciousness
directly
on
its
privileges
(as
in
the
case
of
the
knights
during
the
Reformation)
or
else
–
no
less
directly
–
on
the
particular
element
of
society
from
---------------
absorbed
economically
into
a
number
of
different
classes
,
it
still
retains
this
(objectively
unreal)
ideological
coherence
.


For
the
relation
to
the
whole
created
by
the
consciousness
of
one’s
status
is
not
directed
to
the
real
,
living
economic
unity
but
to
a
past
state
of
society
as
constituted
by
the
privileges
accorded
to
the
estates
.


Status
–
consciousness
–
a
real
historical
factor
masks
class
consciousness
;
in
fact
it
prevents
it
from
emerging
at
all
.


A
like
phenomenon
can
be
observed
under
capitalism
in
the
case
of
all
‘privileged’
groups
whose
---------------
control
(as
was
the
case
with
the
great
landowners)
.



Thus
class
consciousness
has
quite
a
different
relation
to
history
in
pre-capitalist
and
capitalist
periods
.


In
the
former
case
the
classes
could
only
be
deduced
from
the
immediately
given
historical
reality
by
---------------
its
starkness
as
the
motor
of
history
.


In
pre-capitalist
periods
man
could
never
become
conscious
(not
even
by
virtue
of
an
‘imputed’
consciousness)
of
the
“true
driving
forces
which
stand
behind
the
motives
of
human
actions
in
history”
.


They
remained
hidden
behind
motives
and
were
in
truth
the
blind
forces
of
history
.


Ideological
---------------

But
there
is
still
an
unbridgeable
gulf
between
this
and
capitalism
where
economic
factors
are
not
concealed
‘behind’
consciousness
but
are
present
in
consciousness
itself
(albeit
unconsciously
or
repressed)
.


With
capitalism
,
with
the
abolition
of
the
feudal
estates
and
with
the
creation
of
a
society
with
a
purely
economic
articulation
,
class
consciousness
arrived
at
the
point
where
it
could
become
conscious
.


From
then
on
social
conflict
was
reflected
in
an
ideological
struggle
for
consciousness
and
for
the
veiling
or
the
exposure
of
the
class
character
of
society
.


But
the
fact
that
this
conflict
became
possible
points
forward
to
the
dialectical
contradictions
and
the
internal
dissolution
---------------
of
society
rather
than
on
the
construction
of
society
as
a
whole
.



The
question
of
consciousness
may
make
its
appearance
in
terms
of
the
objectives
chosen
or
in
terms
of
action
,
as
for
instance
in
the
case
of
the
petty
bourgeoisie
.


This
class
lives
at
least
in
part
in
the
---------------
it
into
harmony”
.


^([25])
In
all
decisions
crucial
for
society
its
actions
will
be
irrelevant
and
it
will
be
forced
to
fight
for
both
sides
in
turn
but
always
without
consciousness
.


In
so
doing
its
own
objectives
–
which
exist
exclusively
in
its
own
consciousness
–
must
become
progressively
weakened
and
increasingly
divorced
from
social
action
.


Ultimately
they
will
assume
purely
‘ideological’
forms
The
petty
---------------
of
1789
or
the
Russian
Revolution
of
1917)
,
or
reactionary
(as
with
Napoleon’s
coup
d’état)
will
depend
on
the
position
of
the
other
classes
involved
in
the
conflict
,
and
on
the
level
of
consciousness
of
the
parties
that
lead
them
.


For
this
reason
,
too
,
the
ideological
form
taken
by
the
class
consciousness
of
the
peasants
changes
its
content
more
frequently
than
that
of
other
classes
:
this
is
because
it
is
always
borrowed
from
elsewhere
.



Hence
parties
that
base
themselves
wholly
or
in
part
on
this
class
consciousness
always
lack
really
firm
and
secure
support
in
critical
situations
(as
was
true
of
the
Socialist
Revolutionaries
in
1917
and
1918)
.


This
explains
why
it
is
possible
for
peasant
conflicts
to
be
fought
out
under
opposing
flags
.


Thus
it
is
highly
characteristic
of
both
Anarchism
and
the
‘class
consciousness
of
the
peasantry
that
a
number
of
counter-revolutionary
rebellions
and
uprisings
of
the
middle
and
upper
strata
of
the
peasantry
in
Russia
should
have
found
the
anarchist
view
of
society
to
be
a
satisfying
ideology
.


We
cannot
really
speak
of
class
consciousness
in
the
case
of
these
classes
(if
,
indeed
,
we
can
,
even
speak
of
them
as
classes
in
the
strict
Marxist
sense
of
the
term)
:
for
a
full
consciousness
of
their
situation
would
reveal
to
them
the
hopelessness
of
their
particularise
strivings
in
the
face
of
the
inevitable
course
of
events
.


Consciousness
and
self-interest
then
are
mutually
incompatible
in
this
instance
.


And
as
class
consciousness
was
defined
in
terms
of
the
problems
of
imputing
class
interests
the
failure
of
their
class
consciousness
to
develop
in
the
immediately
given
historical
reality
becomes
comprehensible
philosophically
.



With
the
bourgeoisie
,
also
,
class
consciousness
stands
in
opposition
to
class
interest
.


But
here
the
antagonism
is
not
contradictory
but
dialectical
.


---------------
The
distinction
between
the
two
modes
of
contradiction
may
be
briefly
described
in
this
way
:
in
the
case
of
the
other
classes
,
a
class
consciousness
is
prevented
from
emerging
by
their
position
within
the
process
of
production
and
the
interests
this
generates
.


In
the
case
of
the
bourgeoisie
,
however
,
these
factors
combine
to
produce
a
class
consciousness
but
one
which
is
cursed
by
its
very
nature
with
the
tragic
fate
of
developing
an
insoluble
contradiction
at
the
very
zenith
of
its
powers
.


As
a
result
of
this
contradiction
it
must
annihilate
itself
.


---------------
into
a
new
repressiveness
.


Sociologically
,
the
bourgeoisie
did
everything
in
its
power
to
eradicate
the
fact
of
class
conflict
from
the
consciousness
of
society
,
even
though
class
conflict
had
only
emerged
in
its
purity
and
became
established
as
an
historical
fact
with
the
advent
of
capitalism
.


Ideologically
,
we
see
the
same
contradiction
in
the
fact
---------------
All
these
contradictions
,
and
the
list
might
be
extended
indefinitely
,
are
only
the
reflection
of
the
deepest
contradictions
in
capitalism
itself
as
they
appear
in
the
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
in
accordance
with
their
position
in
the
total
system
of
production
.


For
this
reason
they
appear
as
dialectical
contradictions
in
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
.


They
do
not
merely
reflect
the
inability
of
the
bourgeoisie
to
grasp
the
contradictions
inherent
in
its
own
social
order
.


For
,
on
the
one
hand
,
capitalism
is
the
first
system
---------------
^([27])
and
this
implies
that
in
theory
the
bourgeoisie
should
be
able
to
progress
from
this
central
point
to
the
possession
of
an
(imputed)
class
consciousness
of
the
whole
system
of
production
.


On
the
other
hand
,
the
position
held
by
the
capitalist
class
and
the
interests
which
determine
its
actions
ensure
that
it
will
be
unable
to
control
its
own
---------------
There
are
many
reasons
for
this
.


In
the
first
place
,
it
only
seems
to
be
true
that
for
capitalism
production
occupies
the
centre
of
class
consciousness
and
hence
provides
the
theoretical
starting-point
for
analysis
.


With
reference
to
Ricardo
“who
had
been
reproached
with
an
exclusive
concern
with
production”
,
Marx
emphasised
^([28])
that
he
---------------
production
through
cartels
and
trusts
only
shifts
the
contradiction
elsewhere
,
without
,
however
,
eliminating
it
.


This
situation
forms
one
of
the
decisive
factors
governing
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
.


It
is
true
that
the
bourgeoisie
acts
as
a
class
in
the
objective
evolution
of
society
.


But
it
understands
the
process
(which
it
---------------
bafflement
felt
by
the
individual
capitalist
when
confronted
by
his
own
individual
fate
.


The
facts
and
the
situations
which
induce
this
panic
force
something
into
the
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
which
is
too
much
of
a
brute
fact
for
its
existence
to
be
wholly
denied
or
repressed
.


But
equally
it
is
something
that
the
bourgeoisie
can
never
fully
---------------

In
this
way
the
objective
limits
of
capitalist
production
become
the
limits
of
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
.


The
older
‘natural’
and
‘conservative’
forms
of
domination
had
left
unmolested
^([34])
the
forms
of
production
of
whole
sections
of
the
people
they
---------------
ignorance
of
the
objective
economic
limitations
of
its
own
system
expresses
itself
as
an
internal
,
dialectical
contradiction
in
its
class
consciousness

This
means
that
formally
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
is
geared
to
economic
consciousness
.


And
indeed
the
highest
degree
of
unconsciousness
,
the
crassest
,
form
of
‘false
consciousness’
always
manifests
itself
when
the
conscious
mastery
of
economic
phenomena
appears
to
be
at
its
greatest
.


From
the
point
of
view
of
the
relation
of
consciousness
to
society
this
contradiction
is
expressed
as
the
irreconcilable
antagonism
between
ideology
and
economic
base
.


Its
dialectics
are
grounded
in
the
irreconcilable
antagonism
between
the
(capitalist)
individual
,
i
.

e
.


the
stereotyped
individual
of
capitalism
,
and
the
‘natural’
and
inevitable
process
of
development
,
i
.

e
.


the
process
not
subject
to
consciousness
.


In
consequence
theory
and
practice
are
brought
into
irreconcilable
opposition
to
each
other
.


But
the
resulting
dualism
is
anything
but
stable
;
in
fact
it
constantly
strives
---------------
disruption
.



This
internal
dialectical
contradiction
in
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
is
further
aggravated
by
the
fact
that
the
objective
limits
of
capitalism
do
not
remain
purely
negative
.


That
is
to
say
that
capitalism
does
not
merely
set
‘natural’
laws
in
motion
that
provoke
crises
which
it
cannot
comprehend
.


On
the
contrary
,
those
limits
acquire
a
historical
embodiment
with
its
own
consciousness
and
its
own
actions
:
the
proletariat
.



---------------
capitalism
,
the
bourgeoisie
was
thrown
back
increasingly
on
to
a
conscious
defensive
.


The
dialectical
contradiction
in
the
‘false’
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
became
more
and
more
acute
:
the
‘false’
consciousness
was
converted
into
a
mendacious
consciousness
.


What
had
been
at
first
an
objective
contradiction
now
became
subjective
also
:
the
theoretical
problem
turned
into
a
moral
posture
which
decisively
---------------

Thus
the
situation
in
which
the
bourgeoisie
finds
itself
determines
the
function
of
its
class
consciousness
in
its
struggle
to
achieve
control
of
society
.


The
hegemony
of
the
bourgeoisie
really
does
embrace
the
whole
of
society
;
it
really
does
attempt
to
organise
the
whole
of
---------------
the
rule
of
a
minority
.


Its
hegemony
is
exercised
not
merely
by
a
minority
but
in
the
interest
of
that
minority
,
so
the
need
to
deceive
the
other
classes
and
to
ensure
that
their
class
consciousness
remains
amorphous
is
inescapable
for
a
bourgeois
regime
.


(Consider
here
the
theory
of
the
state
that
stands
‘above’
class
antagonisms
,
or
the
notion
---------------
‘essence’
of
history
and
the
state
.


But
in
vain
:
with
the
end
of
the
century
the
issue
was
resolved
by
the
advances
of
science
and
their
corresponding
effects
on
the
consciousness
of
the
capitalist
elite
.



This
can
be
seen
very
clearly
in
the
bourgeoisie’s
greater
readiness
to
---------------
with
current
attempts
to
harmonise
a
‘planned’
economy
with
the
class
interests
of
the
bourgeoisie
,
we
are
forced
to
admit
that
what
we
are
witnessing
is
the
capitulation
of
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
before
that
of
the
proletariat
.


Of
course
the
section
of
the
bourgeoisie
that
accepts
the
notion
of
a
‘planned’
economy
does
not
mean
---------------
4

In
this
struggle
for
consciousness
historical
materialism
plays
a
crucial
role
.


Ideologically
no
less
than
economically
,
the
bourgeoisie
and
the
proletariat
are
mutually
interdependent
.


The
same
process
that

of

power-factor
of
the
first
,
and
perhaps
decisive
importance
.



The
unique
function
of
consciousness
in
the
class
struggle
of
the
proletariat
has
consistently
been
overlooked
by
the
vulgar
Marxists
who
have
substituted
a
petty
‘Realpolitik’
for
the
great
battle
of
principle
---------------
social
change
.


When
the
vulgar
Marxists
detach
themselves
from
this
central
point
of
view
,
i
.

e
.


from
the
point
where
a
proletarian
class
consciousness
arises
,
they
thereby
place
themselves
on
the
level
of
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
.


And
that
the
bourgeoisie
fighting
on
its
own
ground
will
prove
superior
to
the
proletariat
both
economically
and
ideologically
can
come
as
a
surprise
only
to
a
vulgar
Marxist
.


---------------
its
ability
to
see
society
from
the
centre
as
a
coherent
whole
.


This
means
that
it
is
able
to
act
in
such
a
way
as
to
change
reality
;
in
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
theory
and
practice
coincide
and
so
it
can
consciously
throw
the
weight
of
its
actions
onto
the
scales
of
history
–
and
this
is
the
deciding
factor
.


When
the
vulgar
Marxists
---------------
various
elements
of
the
process
they
had
hoped
to
master
.



The
class
consciousness
that
springs
from
this
position
must
exhibit
the
same
internal
structure
as
that
of
the
bourgeoisie
.


But
when
the
logic
of
events
drives
the
same
dialectical
contradictions
to
the
surface
of
consciousness
the
consequences
for
the
proletariat
are
even
more
disastrous
than
for
the
bourgeoisie
.


For
despite
all
the
dialectical
contradictions
,
despite
all
its
objective
falseness
,
the
self-deceiving
‘false’
consciousness
that
we
find
in
the
bourgeoisie
is
at
least
in
accord
with
its
class
situation
.


It
cannot
save
the
bourgeoisie
from
the
constant
exacerbation
of
these
contradictions
and
so
from
destruction
,
---------------
victories
,
albeit
of
short
duration
.



But
in
the
case
of
the
proletariat
such
a
consciousness
not
only
has
to
overcome
these
internal
(bourgeois)
contradictions
,
but
it
also
conflicts
with
the
course
of
action
to
which
the
economic
situation
---------------
comes
to
it
1
s
goal
the
more
urgent
it
becomes
for
the
proletariat
to
understand
its
own
historical
mission
and
the
more
vigorously
and
directly
proletarian
class
consciousness
will
determine
each
of
its
actions
.


For
the
blind
power
of
the
forces
at
work
will
only
advance
‘automatically’
to
their
goal
of
self-annihilation
as
long
as
that
goal
---------------
capitalism
develops
,
the
fate
of
the
revolution
(and
with
it
the
fate
of
mankind)
will
depend
on
the
ideological
maturity
of
the
proletariat
,
i
.

e
.


on
its
class
consciousness
.



We
have
now
determined
the
unique
function
of
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
in
contrast
to
that
of
other
classes
.


The
proletariat
cannot
liberate
itself
as
a
class
without
simultaneously
abolishing
class
society
as
such
.


For
that
reason
its
consciousness
,
the
last
class
consciousness
in
the
history
of
mankind
,
must
both
lay
bare
the
nature
of
society
and
achieve
an
increasingly
inward
fusion
of
theory
and
practice
.


‘Ideology’
for
the
proletariat
is
no
banner
to
follow
into
---------------
the
level
of
mere
‘ideology’
and
forces
the
proletariat
to
use
bourgeois
(or
petty
bourgeois)
tactics
.


It
thereby
robs
it
of
its
greatest
strength
by
forcing
class
consciousness
into
the
secondary
or
inhibiting
role
of
a
bourgeois
consciousness
,
instead
of
the
active
role
of
a
proletarian
consciousness
.



The
relationship
between
class
consciousness
and
class
situation
is
really
very
simple
in
the
case
of
the
proletariat
,
but
the
obstacles
which
prevent
its
consciousness
being
realised
in
practice
are
correspondingly
greater
.


In
the
first
place
this
consciousness
is
divided
within
itself
.


It
is
true
that
society
as
such
is
highly
unified
and
that
it
evolves
in
a
unified
manner
.


But
in
a
world
where
the
---------------
environment
it
looks
as
if
there
is
not
a
unity
but
a
diversity
of
mutually
independent
objects
and
forces
.


The
most
striking
division
in
proletarian
class
consciousness
and
the
one
most
fraught
with
consequences
is
the
separation
of
the
economic
struggle
from
the
political
one
.


Marx
repeatedly
exposed
^([37])
the
fallacy
of
this
split
---------------
Classes
that
successfully
carried
out
revolutions
in
earlier
societies
had
their
task
made
easier
subjective
by
this
very
fact
of
the
discrepancy
between
their
own
class
consciousness
and
the
objective
economic
set-up
,
i
.

e
.


by
their
very
unawareness
of
their
own
function
in
the
process
of
change
.


They
had
only
to
use
the
power
at
their
disposal
---------------

But
as
the
proletariat
has
been
entrusted
by
history
with
the
task
of
transforming
social
consciously
,
its
class
consciousness
must
develop
a
dialectical
contradiction
between
its
immediate
interests
and
its
long-term
objectives
,
and
between
the
discrete
factors
and
the
whole
.


---------------
consciously
beyond
the
confines
of
capitalist
society
.



This
means
that
subjectively
,
i
.

e
.


for
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
,
the
dialectical
relationship
between
immediate
interests
and
objective
impact
on
the
whole
of
society
is
loc
in
the
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
itself
.


It
does
not
work
itself
out
as
a
purely
objective
process
quite
apart
from
all
(imputed)
consciousness
–
as
was
the
case
with
all
classes
hitherto
.


Thus
the
revolutionary
victory
of
the
proletariat
does
not
imply
,
as
with
former
classes
,
the
immediate
---------------

This
inner
dialectic
makes
it
hard
for
the
proletariat
to
develop
its
class
consciousness
in
opposition
to
that
of
the
bourgeoisie
which
by
cultivating
the
crudest
and
most
abstract
kind
of
empiricism
was
able
to
make
do
with
a
superficial
view
of
the
world
.

^([38])
For
because
of
its
situation
this
contradiction
is
introduced
directly
into
the
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
,
whereas
the
bourgeoisie
,
from
its
situation
,
saw
the
contradictions
confronting
it
as
the
outer
limits
of
its
consciousness
.



Conversely
,
this
contradiction
means
that
‘false’
consciousness
is
something
very
different
for
the
proletariat
than
for
every
preceding
class
.


Even
correct
statements
about
particular
situations
or
aspects
of
the
development
of
bourgeois
class
consciousness
reveal
,
when
related
to
the
whole
of
society
,
the
limits
of
that
consciousness
and
unmask
its
‘falseness’
.


Whereas
the
proletariat
always
aspires
towards
the
truth
even
in
its
‘false’
consciousness
and
in
its
substantive
errors
.


It
is
sufficient
here
to
recall
the
social
criticism
of
the
Utopians
or
the
proletarian
and
revolutionary
extension
of
Ricardo’s
theory
.


Concerning
---------------

Only
with
the
aid
of
this
distinction
can
there
be
any
resolution
of
the
contradiction
in
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
;
only
with
its
aid
can
that
contradiction
become
a
conscious
f
actor
in
history
.


For
the
objective
aspiration
towards
truth
which
is
immanent
even
in
the
‘false’
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
does
not
at
all
imply
that
this
aspiration
can
come
to
light
without
the
active
intervention
of
the
proletariat
.


On
the
contrary
,
the
mere
aspiration
towards
truth
can
only
strip
off
the
veils
of
falseness
and
mature
into
historically
significant
and
socially
revolutionary
knowledge
by
the
potentiating
of
consciousness
,
by
conscious
action
and
conscious
self-criticism
.


Such
knowledge
would
of
course
be
unattainable
were
it
not
for
the
objective
aspiration
,
and
here
we
find
confirmation
of
Marx’s
dictum
that
mankind
---------------
the
fruit
of
the
conscious
deeds
of
the
proletariat
.



The
dialectical
cleavage
in
the
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
is
a
product
of
the
same
structure
that
makes
the
historical
mission
of
the
proletariat
possible
by
pointing
forward
and
beyond
the
existing
social
---------------
the
class’s
self-interest
and
that
of
society
,
between
individual
deed
and
social
consequences
.


This
antagonism
set
an
external
limit
to
consciousness
.


Here
,
in
the
centre
of
proletarian
class
consciousness
we
discover
an
antagonism
between
momentary
interest
and
ultimate
goal
.


The
outward
victory
of
the
proletariat
can
only
be
achieved
if
this
---------------

As
we
stressed
in
the
motto
to
this
essay
the
existence
of
this
conflict
enables
us
to
perceive
that
class
consciousness
is
identical
with
neither
the
psychological
consciousness
of
individual
members
of
the
proletariat
,
nor
with
the
(mass-psychological)
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
as
a
whole
;
but
it
is
,
on
the
contrary
,
the
sense
,
become
conscious
,
of
the
historical
role
of
the
class
.


This
sense
will
---------------
may
have
either
of
two
functions
:
either
it
will
be
a
step
towards
the
ultimate
goal
or
else
it
will
conceal
it
.


Which
of
the
two
it
will
be
depends
entirely
upon
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
and
not
on
victory
or
defeat
in
isolated
skirmishes
.


Marx
drew
attention
very
early
on
^([41])
to
this
danger
,
which
is
particularly
acute
on
the
---------------
struggle
to
achieve
it
as
a
means
of
education
for
the
final
battle
whose
outcome
depends
on
closing
the
gap
between
the
psychological
consciousness
and
the
imputed
one
.


Instead
it
regards
the
particular
as
a
valuable
achievement
in
itself
or
at
least
as
a
step
along
the
path
towards
the
ultimate
goal
.


In
a
word
,
opportunism
mistakes
the
actual
,
psychological
state
0
consciousness
of
proletarians
for
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
.



The
practical
damage
resulting
from
this
confusion
can
be
seen
in
the
great
loss
of
unity
and
cohesiveness
in
proletarian
praxis
when
compared
to
the
unity
of
the
objective
economic
tendencies
.


The
superior
strength
of
true
,
practical
class
consciousness
lies
in
the
ability
to
look
beyond
the
divisive
symptoms
of
the
economic
process
to
the
unity
of
the
total
social
system
underlying
it
.


In
the
age
of
capitalism
it
is
not
---------------
branch
of
industry
,
in
the
form
of
‘economic’
or
‘political’
crisis
,
etc
.

)
,
and
even
if
in
consequence
the
reflex
of
the
crisis
is
fragmented
in
the
immediate
psychological
consciousness
of
the
workers
,
it
is
still
possible
and
necessary
to
advance
beyond
this
consciousness
.


And
this
is
instinctively
felt
to
be
a
necessity
by
larger
and
larger
sections
of
the
proletariat
.


---------------
tendency
until
the
crisis
became
acute
.


Now
,
however
,
it
adopts
a
course
directly
opposed
to
it
.


Its
aim
now
is
to
scotch
the
development
of
proletarian
class
consciousness
in
its
progress
from
that
which
is
merely
given
to
that
which
conforms
to
the
objective
total
process
;
even
more
,
it
hopes
to
reduce
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
to
the
level
of
the
psychologically
given
and
thus
to
divert
into
the
opposite
direction
what
had
hitherto
been
the
purely
instinctive
tendency
.


As
long
as
the
unification
of
proletarian
class
consciousness
was
not
a
practical
possibility
this
theory
could
–
with
some
charity
–
be
regarded
as
a
mere
error
.


But
in
this
situation
it
takes
on
the
---------------
right
instincts
of
the
proletariat
it
plays
the
same
role
as
that
played
hitherto
by
Capitalist
theory
:
it
denounces
the
correct
view
of
the
overall
economic
situation
and
the
correct
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
together
with
its
organised
form
,
the
Communist
Party
,
as
something
unreal
and
inimical
to
the
‘true’
interests
of
the
workers
(i
.

e
.


their
immediate
,
national
or
professional
interests)
and
as
something
alien
to
their
‘genuine’
class
consciousness
(i
.

e
.


that
which
is
psychologically
given)
.



To
say
that
class
consciousness
has
no
psychological
reality
does
not
imply
that
it
is
a
mere
fiction
.


Its
reality
is
vouched
for
by
its
ability
to
explain
the
infinitely
painful
path
of
the
proletarian
---------------
the
celebrated
passage
in
The
Eighteenth
Brumaire
.



Only
the
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
can
point
to
the
way
that
leads
out
of
the
impasse
of
capitalism
.


As
long
as
this
consciousness
is
lacking
,
the
crisis
remains
permanent
,
it
goes
back
to
its
starting-point
,
repeats
the
cycle
until
after
infinite
sufferings
and
---------------
is
to
say
,
the
class
struggle
must
be
raised
from
the
level
of
economic
necessity
to
the
level
of
conscious
aim
and
effective
class
consciousness
.


The
pacifists
and
humanitarians
of
the
class
struggle
whose
efforts
tend
whether
they
will
or
no
to
retard
this
lengthy
,
painful
and
crisis-ridden
process
would
be
horrified
if
they
could
but
---------------
The
only
question
at
issue
is
how
much
it
has
to
suffer
before
it
achieves
ideological
maturity
,
before
it
acquires
a
true
understanding
of
its
class
situation
and
a
true
class
consciousness
.



Of
course
this
uncertainty
and
lack
of
clarity
are
themselves
the
---------------
criticism
and
the
negation
of
this
form
of
life
.


But
until
the
objective
crisis
of
capitalism
has
matured
and
until
the
proletariat
has
achieved
true
class
consciousness
,
and
the
ability
to
understand
the
crisis
fully
,
it
cannot
go
beyond
the
criticism
of
reification
and
so
it
is
only
negatively
superior
to
its
antagonist
.


Indeed
,
if
it
can
do
no
more
---------------
unionists
.


Such
criticism
from
the
standpoint
of
capitalism
can
be
seen
most
strikingly
in
the
separation
of
the
various
theatres
of
war
.


The
bare
fact
of
separation
itself
indicates
that
the
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
is
still
fettered
by
reification
.


And
if
the
proletariat
finds
the
economic
inhumanity
to
which
it
is
subjected
easier
to
---------------
unconquered
power
of
capitalist
forms
of
life
in
the
proletariat
itself
.



The
reified
consciousness
must
also
remain
hopelessly
trapped
in
the
two
extremes
of
crude
empiricism
and
abstract
utopianism
.


In
the
one
case
,
consciousness
becomes
either
a
completely
passive
observer
moving
in
obedience
to
laws
which
it
can
never
control
.


In
the
other
it
regards
itself
as
a
power
which
is
able
of
its
own
–
subjective
–
volition
to
master
the
essentially
meaningless
motion
of
objects
.


We
have
already
identified
the
crude
empiricism
of
the
opportunists
in
its
relation
to
proletarian
class
consciousness
.


We
must
now
go
on
to
see
utopianism
as
characteristic
of
the
internal
divisions
within
class
consciousness
.


(The
separation
of
empiricism
from
utopianism
undertaken
here
for
purely
methodological
reasons
should
not
be
taken
as
an
admission
that
the
two
---------------

The
philosophical
efforts
of
the
young
Marx
were
largely
directed
towards
the
refutation
of
the
various
false
theories
of
consciousness
(including
both
the
‘idealism’
of
the
Hegelian
School
and
the
‘materialism’
of
Feuerbach)
and
towards
the
discovery
of
a
correct
view
of
the
role
of
consciousness
in
history
.


As
early
as
the
Correspondence
of
1843
[with
Ruge]
he
conceives
of
consciousness
as
immanent
in
history
.


Consciousness
does
not
lie
outside
the
real
process
of
history
.


It
does
not
have
to
be
introduced
into
the
world
by
philosophers
;
therefore
to
gaze
down
arrogantly
upon
the
petty
struggles
of
the
world
and
to
despise
them
is
indefensible
.


“We
only
show
it
[the
world]
what
its
struggles
are
about
and
consciousness
is
a
thing
that
it
must
needs
acquire
whether
it
will
or
not
.

”
What
is
needed
then
is
only
“to
explain
its
own
actions
to
it”
.


^([44])
The
great
polemic
against
Hegel
in
The
Holy
Family
concentrates
mainly
on
this
point
.


^([45])
,
Hegel’s
inadequacy
is
that
he
only
seems
to
allow
the
absolute
spirit
to
make
history
.


The
resulting
otherworldliness
of
consciousness
vis-à-vis
the
real
events
of
history
becomes
,
in
the
hands
of
Hegel’s
disciples
,
an
arrogant
–
and
reactionary
confrontation
of
‘spirit’
and
‘mass’
.


Marx
---------------

Complementing
this
is
his
–
aphoristic
–
critique
of
Feuerbach
.


The
materialists
had
elaborated
a
view
of
consciousness
as
of
something
appertaining
to
this
world
.


Marx
sees
it
as
merely
one
stage
in
the
process
,
the
stage
of
‘bourgeois
society’
.


He
opposes
to
it
the
notion
of
consciousness
as
‘practical
critical
activity’
with
the
task
of
‘changing
the
world’
.



This
provides
us
with
the
philosophical
foundation
we
need
to
settle
accounts
with
the
utopians
.


For
their
thought
contains
this
very
duality
of
social
process
and
the
consciousness
of
it
.


Consciousness
approaches
society
from
another
world
and
leads
it
from
.


the
false
path
it
has
followed
back
to
the
right
one
.


The
utopians
are
prevented
by
the
---------------
bearer
of
historical
movement
in
history
itself
,
in
the
way
the
proletariat
organises
itself
as
a
class
and
,
hence
,
in
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
.


They
are
not
yet
able
to
“take
note
of
what
is
happening
before
their
very
eyes
and
to
become
its
mouthpiece”
.


^([46])
---------------
means
that
utopianism
can
be
dismissed
as
a
factor
in
the
proletariat’s
struggle
for
freedom
.


This
is
true
only
for
those
stages
of
class
consciousness
that
have
really
achieved
the
unity
of
theory
and
practice
described
by
Marx
,
the
real
and
practical
intervention
of
class
consciousness
in
the
course
of
history
and
hence
the
practical
understanding
of
reification
.


And
this
did
not
all
happen
at
a
single
stroke
and
in
a
coherent
manner
.


For
there
are
not
merely
national
and
‘social’
stages
involved
but
there
are
also
gradations
within
the
class
consciousness
of
workers
in
the
same
strata
.


The
separation
of
economics
from
politics
is
the
most
revealing
and
also
the
most
important
instance
of
this
.


It
appears
that
some
sections
of
the
proletariat
have
quite
the
right
instincts
as
far
as
the
economic
struggle
goes
and
can
even
raise
them
to
the
level
of
class
consciousness
.


At
the
same
time
,
‘however
,
when
it
comes
to
political
questions
they
manage
to
persist
in
a
completely
utopian
point
of
view
.


It
does
not
need
to
be
emphasised
that
---------------
not
yet
possible
to
see
society
;is
a
whole
.


This
can
be
seen
at
its
clearest
in
purely
ideological
questions
,
in
questions
of
culture
.


These
questions
occupy
an
almost
wholly
isolated
position
in
the
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
;
the
organic
bonds
connecting
these
issues
with
the
immediate
life-interests
of
the
proletariat
as
well
as
with
society
as
a
whole
have
not
even
begun
to
penetrate
its
consciousness
.


The
achievement
in
this
area
hardly
ever
goes
beyond
the
self-criticism
of
capitalism
–
carried
out
here
by
the
proletariat
.


What
is
positive
here
---------------

These
gradations
are
,
then
,
on
the
one
hand
,
objective
historical
necessities
,
nuances
in
the
objective
possibilities
of
consciousness
(such
as
the
relative
cohesiveness
of
politics
and
economics
in
comparison
to
cultural
questions)
.


On
the
other
hand
,
where
consciousness
already
exists
as
an
objective
possibility
,
they
indicate
degrees
of
distance
between
the
psychological
class
consciousness
and
the
adequate
understanding
of
the
total
situation
.


These
gradations
,
however
,
can
no
longer
be
referred
back
to
socioeconomic
causes
.


The
objective
theory
of
class
consciousness
is
the
theory
of
its
objective
possibility
.


The
stratification
of
the
problems
and
economic
interests
within
the
proletariat
is
,
unfortunately
,
almost
wholly
unexplored
,
but
---------------
various
strata
,
we
would
still
be
confronted
at
every
turn
with
the
problem
of
whether
it
is
actually
possible
to
make
the
objective
possibility
of
class
consciousness
into
a
reality
.


Hitherto
this
question
could
only
occur
to
extraordinary
individuals
(consider
Marx’s
completely
non-utopian
prescience
with
regard
to
the
problems
of
---------------
in
an
increasingly
radical
and
conscious
manner
.


When
this
weapon
increases
in
power
to
the
point
where
it
becomes
the
organ
of
state
,
this
is
a
sign
that
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
is
on
the
verge
of
overcoming
the
bourgeois
outlook
of
its
leaders
.



The
revolutionary
workers’
council
(not
to
be
confused
with
its
opportunist
caricatures)
is
one
of
the
forms
which
the
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
has
striven
to
create
ever
since
its
inception
.


The
fact
that
it
exists
and
is
constantly
developing
shows
that
the
proletariat
already
stands
on
the
threshold
of
its
own
consciousness
and
hence
on
the
threshold
of
victory
.


The
workers’
council
spells
the
political
and
economic
defeat
of
reification
.


In
the
period
following
the
dictatorship
---------------

Thus
we
must
never
overlook
the
distance
that
separates
the
consciousness
of
even
the
most
revolutionary
worker
from
the
authentic
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
.


But
even
this
situation
can
be
explained
on
the
basis
of
the
Marxist
theory
of
class
struggle
and
class
consciousness
.


The
proletariat
only
perfects
itself
by
annihilating
and
transcending
itself
,
by
creating
the
classless
society
through
the
successful
conclusion
of
its
own
class
struggle
.


The
struggle
for
this
---------------
It
is
equally
the
struggle
of
the
proletariat
against
itself
.


against
the
devastating
and
degrading
effects
of
the
capitalist
system
upon
its
class
consciousness
.


The
proletariat
will
only
have
won
the
real
victory
when
it
has
overcome
these
effects
within
itself
.


The
separation
of
the
areas
that
should
be
united
,
the
diverse
stages
of
consciousness
which
the
proletariat
has
reached
in
the
various
spheres
of
activity
are
a
precise
index
of
what
has
been
achieved
and
what
remains
to
be
done
.


The
---------------
economic
self-contradiction
of
any
purely
capitalist
society
is
undoubtedly
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
contradictions
in
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
.

Sleeping
is
not
considered
unconsciousness
if
waking
up
would
result
in
normal
consciousness
Between
consciousness
and
unconsciousness
there
are
several
altered
levels
,
each
with
its
own
definition
.




Altered
Level
of
Consciousness


Altered
or
abnormal
levels
of
consciousness
are
states
in
which
you
either
have
decreased
cognitive
function
or
cannot
be
easily
aroused
.



Most
medical
conditions
affect
the
brain
and
impair
consciousness
when
they
become
serious
or
life-threatening
.


An
altered
LOC
usually
signals
a
serious
medical
problem
.

An
altered
level
of
consciousness
is
any
measure
of
arousal
other
than
normal
.


Level
of
consciousness
(LOC)
is
a
measurement
of
a
person
'
s
arousability
and
responsiveness
to
stimuli
from
the
environment
.

^([1])
A
mildly
depressed
level
of
consciousness
or
alertness
may
be
classed
as
lethargy
;
someone
in
this
state
can
be
aroused
with
little
difficulty
.

^([1])
People
who
are
obtunded
have
a
more
depressed
level
of
consciousness
and
cannot
be
fully
aroused
.

^([1][2])
Those
who
are
not
able
to
be
aroused
from
a
sleep-like
state
are
said
to
be
stuporous
.

^([1][2])
Coma
is
the
inability
to
make
any
purposeful
response
.

^([1][2])
Scales
such
as
the
Glasgow
coma
scale
have
been
designed
to
measure
the
level
of
consciousness
.



An
altered
level
of
consciousness
can
result
from
a
variety
of
factors
,
including
alterations
in
the
chemical
environment
of
the
brain
(e
.

g
.


exposure
to
poisons
or
intoxicants)
,
insufficient
oxygen
or
blood
flow
in
the
brain
,
and
excessive
pressure
within
the
skull
.


Prolonged
unconsciousness
is
understood
to
be
a
sign
of
a
medical
emergency
.

^([3])
A
deficit
in
the
level
of
consciousness
suggests
that
both
of
the
cerebral
hemispheres
or
the
reticular
activating
system
have
been
injured
.

^([4])
A
decreased
level
of
consciousness
correlates
to
increased
morbidity
(sickness)
and
mortality
(death)
.

^([5])
Thus
it
is
a
valuable
measure
of
a
patient
'
s
medical
and
neurological
status
.


In
fact
,
some
sources
consider
level
of
consciousness
to
be
one
of
the
vital
signs
.

^([3][6])

[edit]

Scales
and
terms
to
classify
the
levels
of
consciousness
differ
,
but
in
general
,
reduction
in
response
to
stimuli
indicates
an
altered
level
of
consciousness

Summary
(Kruse)^([2])
Description

Metaconscious
Preternatural
People
who
possess
the
ability
to
monitor
and
control
their
own
cognitive
processes
in
addition
to
meeting
all
the
criteria
indicative
of
a
normal
level
of
consciousness
.


In
the
field
of
cognitive
neuroscience
,
metacognitive
monitoring
and
control
have
been
viewed
as
functions
of
the
prefrontal
cortex
,
which
receives
sensory
input
signals
from
divergent
cortical
regions
and
implements
control
through
feedback
loops
which
are
established
utilizing
the
underlying
mechanisms
of
neuroplasticity
(see
chapters
by
Schwartz
&
Bacon
and
Shimamura
,
in
Dunlosky
&
Bjork
,
2008)
.

^([7])

Conscious
Normal
Assessment
of
LOC
involves
checking
orientation
:
people
who
are
able
promptly
and
spontaneously
to
state
their
name
,
location
,
and
the
date
or
time
are
said
to
be
oriented
to
self
,
place
,
and
time
,
or
"oriented
X3"
.

^([8])
A
normal
sleep
stage
from
which
a
person
is
easily
awakened
is
also
considered
a
normal
level
of
consciousness
.

^([9])
"Clouding
of
consciousness"
is
a
term
for
a
mild
alteration
of
consciousness
with
alterations
in
attention
and
wakefulness
.

^([9])

Confused
Disoriented
;
impaired
thinking
and
responses
People
who
do
not
respond
quickly
with
information
about
their
name
,
location
,
and
the
time
are
considered
"obtuse"
or
"confused"
.

^([8])
A
confused
person
may
be
bewildered
,
disoriented
,
and
have
difficulty
following
instructions
.

^([9])
The
person
may
have
slow
thinking
and
possible
memory
time
loss
.


This
could
be
caused
by
sleep
deprivation
,
malnutrition
,
allergies
,
environmental
pollution
,
drugs
(prescription
and
nonprescription)
,
and
infection
.



Delirious
Disoriented
;
restlessness
,
hallucinations
,
sometimes
delusions
Some
scales
have
"delirious"
below
this
level
,
in
which
a
person
may
be
restless
or
agitated
and
exhibit
a
marked
deficit
in
attention
.

^([2])

Somnolent
Sleepy
A
somnolent
person
shows
excessive
drowsiness
and
responds
to
stimuli
only
with
incoherent
mumbles
or
disorganized
movements
.

^([8])

Obtunded
Decreased
alertness
;
slowed
psychomotor
responses
In
obtundation
,
a
person
has
a
decreased
interest
in
their
surroundings
,
slowed
responses
,
and
sleepiness
.

^([9])

Stuporous
Sleep-like
state
(not
unconscious)
;
little/no
spontaneous
activity
People
with
an
even
lower
level
of
consciousness
,
stupor
,
only
respond
by
grimacing
or
drawing
away
from
painful
stimuli
.

^([8])

Comatose
Cannot
be
aroused
;
no
response
to
stimuli
Comatose
people
do
not
even
make
this
response
to
stimuli
,
have
no
corneal
or
gag
reflex
,
and
they
may
have
no
pupillary
response
to
light
.

Levels
of
consciousness

Altered
level
of
consciousness
is
sometimes
described
as
altered
sensorium
.



---------------
The
most
commonly
used
tool
for
measuring
LOC
objectively
is
the
Glasgow
Coma
Scale
(GCS)
.


It
has
come
into
almost
universal
use
for
assessing
people
with
brain
injury
,^([2])
or
an
altered
level
of
consciousness
.


Verbal
,
motor
,
and
eye-opening
responses
to
stimuli
are
measured
,
scored
,
and
added
into
a
final
score
on
a
scale
of
3–15
,
with
a
lower
score
being
a
more
decreased
level
of
consciousness
.

formation
.

^([9])
Since
this
system
is
thought
to
modulate
wakefulness
and
sleep
,
interference
with
it
,
such
as
injury
,
illness
,
or
metabolic
disturbances
,
could
alter
the
level
of
consciousness
.

^([9])

Normally
,
stupor
and
coma
are
produced
by
interference
with
the
brain
---------------
coma
due
to
their
effects
on
the
reticular
formation
.

^([11])
Mass
lesions
that
occur
above
the
tentorium
cerebelli
normally
do
not
significantly
alter
the
level
of
consciousness
unless
they
are
very
large
or
affect
both
cerebral
hemispheres
.

^([9])

---------------
reactions
to
stimuli
such
as
touch
and
pain
are
noted
.

^([12])
Reflexes
,
such
as
the
cough
and
gag
reflexes
,
are
also
means
of
judging
LOC
.

^([12])
Once
the
level
of
consciousness
is
determined
,
clinicians
seek
clues
for
the
cause
of
any
alteration
.

^([9])
Usually
the
first
tests
in
the
ER
are
pulse
oximetry
to
determine
if
there
is
hypoxia
,
---------------
[edit]

A
lowered
level
of
consciousness
indicate
a
deficit
in
brain
function
.

^([4])
Level
of
consciousness
can
be
lowered
when
the
brain
receives
insufficient
oxygen
(as
occurs
in
hypoxia)
;
insufficient
blood
(as
occurs
in
shock
,
in
children
for
example
due
to
intussusception)
;
or
has
an
alteration
in
the
brain
'
s
chemistry
.

^([3])
Conditions
of
the
heart
and
conditions
of
the
lungs
can
alter
consciousness
.


Metabolic
disorders
such
as
diabetes
mellitus
and
uremia
can
alter
consciousness
.

^([12])
Hypo-
or
hypernatremia
(decreased
and
elevated
levels
of
sodium
,
respectively)
as
well
as
dehydration
can
also
produce
an
altered
LOC
.

^([13])
A
pH
outside
of
the
range
the
brain
can
tolerate
---------------
can
result
from
traumatic
brain
injury
such
as
concussion
.

^([12])
Ischemic
stroke
and
brain
bleeding
are
other
causes
of
altered
consciousness
.

^([12])
Infections
of
the
central
nervous
system
may
also
be
associated
with
decreased
LOC
;
for
example
,
an
altered
LOC
is
the
most
common
symptom
of
encephalitis
.

^([14])
Neoplasms
within
the
intracranial
cavity
can
also
affect
consciousness
,^([12])
as
can
epilepsy
and
post-seizure
states
.

^([9])
A
decreased
LOC
can
also
result
from
a
combination
of
factors
.

[edit]

Treatment
depends
on
the
degree
of
decrease
in
consciousness
and
its
underlying
cause

treatment
often
involves

administration
of
dextrose

When
documenting
your
patient’s
level
of
consciousness
,
you’ll
notice
you
have
a
LOT
of
options
to
choose
from
.


Your
patient
can
be
alert
,
confused
,
in
a
coma
and
anything
in
between
.


Knowing
the
difference
between
each
level
of
consciousness
will
help
you
chart
accurately
and
communicate
your
patient’s
condition
with
precision
.


The
different
levels
of
consciousness
are
:

-
Alert
:
awake
and
responsive
---------------
unresponsive
,
requiring
immediate
intervention
in
order
to
keep
the
patient
safe
.


Had
I
not
known
how
to
describe
this
patient’s
level
of
consciousness
using
standardized
language
,
there
could
have
been
a
huge
miscommunication
between
me
and
the
MD
.


So
,
let’s
go
through
a
quick
example
using
an
entirely
fictitious
patient
.


Ready
?


---------------
all
morning
,
and
you
have
both
ensured
that
the
appropriate
interventions
have
been
instituted
.


In
a
case
with
patient
with
renal
disease
,
you
will
often
see
them
have
decreasing
levels
of
consciousness
as
their
pH
drops
secondary
to
their
metabolic
acidosis
.


With
a
patient
like
this
,
you
might
anticipate
the
MD
ordering
an
ABG
at
some
---------------
telemetry
unit
.



This
whole
topic
of
consciousness
is
so
incredibly
interesting
,
especially
as
it
relates
to
anesthesia
.

the
difference

the
normal
waking
state
of
animals
and
men
and
their
condition
when
asleep
,
in
a
coma
,
or
under
anesthesia
(the
latter
condition
was
described
as
unconsciousness)

Other
descriptions
included
an
analysis
of
consciousness
as
a
form
of
relationship

act
of
the
mind
toward
objects
in
nature
,
and
a
view
that
consciousness
was
a
continuous
field

stream
of
essentially
mental
“sense
data
,”
roughly
similar
to
the
“ideas”
of
earlier
empirical
philosophers

Altered
consciousness

The
method
employed
by
most
early
writers
in
observing
consciousness
was
introspection—looking
within
one’s
own
mind
to
discover
the
laws
of
its
operation
.


The
limitations
of
the
method
became
apparent
when
it
was
---------------
In
behaviourist
psychology
,
derived
primarily
from
work
of
the
American
psychologist
John
B
.


Watson
in
the
early
1900s
,
the
concept
of
consciousness
was
irrelevant
to
the
objective
investigation
of
human
behaviour
and
was
doctrinally
ignored
in
research
.


Neobehaviourists
,
however
,
adopted
a
more
liberal
posture
toward
mentalistic
states
such
as
consciousness
.



Neurophysiological
mechanisms

That
consciousness
depends
on
the
function
of
the
brain
has
been
known
from
ancient
times
.


Although
detailed
understanding
of
the
neural
mechanisms
of
consciousness
has
not
been
achieved
,
correlations
between
states
of
consciousness
and
functions
of
the
brain
are
possible
.


Levels
of
consciousness
in
terms
of
levels
of
alertness
or
responsiveness
are
correlated
with
patterns
of
electrical
activity
of
the
brain
(brain
waves)
recorded
by
an
electroencephalograph
.


During
wide-awake
consciousness
the
pattern
of
brain
waves
consists
of
rapid
irregular
waves
of
low
amplitude
or
voltage
.


In
contrast
,
during
sleep
,
when
consciousness
can
be
said
to
be
minimal
,
the
brain
waves
are
much
slower
and
of
greater
amplitude
,
often
coming
in
periodic
bursts
of
slow
waxing
and
waning
amplitude
.



Both
behavioral
levels
of
consciousness
and
the
correlated
patterns
of
electrical
activity
are
related
to
the
function
of
a
part
of
the
brainstem
called
the
reticular
formation
.


Electrical
stimulation
of
the
ascending
reticular
systems
arouses
a
sleeping
cat
to
alert
consciousness
and
simultaneously
activates
its
brain
waves
to
the
waking
pattern
.



---------------

It
was
once
supposed
that
the
neurophysiological
mechanisms
subserving
consciousness
and
the
higher
mental
processes
must
reside
in
the
cortex
.


It
is
more
likely
,
however
,
that
the
cortex
serves
the
more
specialized
functions
of
integrating
patterns
of
sensory
experience
and
organizing
motor
patterns
and
that
the
ascending
reticular
system
represents
the
neural
structures
most
critically
related
to
consciousness
.


The
brainstem
reticular
formation
should
not
,
however
,
be
called
the
seat
of
consciousness
.


It
represents
an
integrative
focus
,
functioning
through
its
widespread
interconnections
with
the
cortex
and
other
regions
of
the
brain
.

false
consciousness
,
in
philosophy
,
particularly
within
critical
theory
and
other
Marxist
schools
and
movements
,
the
notion
that
members
of
the
proletariat
unwittingly
misperceive
their
real
position
in
society
and
systematically
misunderstand
their
genuine
interests
within
the
social
relations
of
production
under
capitalism
.


False
consciousness
denotes
people’s
inability
to
recognize
inequality
,
oppression
,
and
exploitation
in
a
capitalist
society
because
of
the
prevalence
within
it
of
views
that
naturalize
and
legitimize
the
existence
of
social
classes
.



Despite
its
close
assocation
with
Marxism
,
the
term
false
consciousness
was
never
used
by
Karl
Marx
.


The
first
treatment
of
false
consciousness
as
a
theoretical
concept
occurred
in
History
and
Class
Consciousness
(1923)
by
the
Hungarian
philosopher
and
literary
critic
György
Lukács

The
word
consciousness
is
used
in
a
variety
of
ways
that
need
to
be
distinguished
.


Sometimes
the
word
means
merely
any
human
mental
activity
at
all
(as
when
one
talks
about
the
“history
of
consciousness”)
,
and
sometimes
it
means
merely
being
awake
(as
in
As
the
anesthetic
wore
off
,
the
animal
regained
consciousness)
.


The
most
philosophically
troublesome
usage
concerns
phenomena
with
which
people
seem
to
be
“directly
acquainted”—as
the
British
philosopher
Bertrand
Russell
(1872–1970)
---------------

It
turns
out
to
be
surprisingly
difficult
to
say
much
about
consciousness
that
is
not
highly
controversial
.


Initial
efforts
in
the
19th
century
to
approach
psychology
with
the
rigour
of
other
experimental
sciences
led
researchers
to
engage
in
careful
introspection
---------------
the
consequent
pitfalls
of
thinking
of
conscious
processes
as
the
central
subject
matter
of
psychology
.


While
it
can
seem
natural
to
think
that
all
mental
phenomena
are
accessible
to
consciousness
,
close
attention
to
the
full
range
of
cases
suggests
otherwise
.


The
Austrian-born
British
philosopher
Ludwig
Wittgenstein
(1889–1951)
was
---------------
In
a
related
vein
,
the
American
linguist
Ray
Jackendoff
proposed
that
one
is
never
directly
conscious
of
abstract
ideas
,
such
as
goodness
and
justice—they
are
not
items
in
the
stream
of
consciousness
.


At
best
,
one
is
aware
of
the
perceptual
qualities
one
might
associate
with
such
ideas—for
example
,
an
image
of
someone
acting
in
a
kindly
way
.


While
it
---------------

Partly
out
of
frustration
with
introspectionism
,
psychologists
during
the
first
half
of
the
20th
century
tended
to
ignore
consciousness
entirely
and
instead
study
only
“objective
behaviour”
(see
below
Radical
behaviourism)
.


In
the
last
decades
of
the
century
,
psychologists
began
to
turn
their
attention
once
again
to
consciousness
and
introspection
,
but
their
methods
differed
radically
from
those
of
early
introspectionists
,
in
ways
that
can
be
understood
against
the
background
---------------
all
.


If
a
person
does
not
have
immediate
knowledge
of
it
,
why
is
it
not
merely
part
of
the
purely
physical
machinery
of
the
brain
?


Why
bring
in
mentality
at
all
?


Accessibility
to
consciousness
,
however
,
is
not
the
only
criterion
for
determining
whether
a
given
state
or
process
is
mental
.


One
alternative
criterion
is
that
mental
states
and
processes
