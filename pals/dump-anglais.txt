Reading
the
philosophical
and
historical
literature
on
conscience
,
the
first
thing
one
would
notice
is
the
variety
of
meanings
and
psychological
and
ethical
assessments
of
the
concept
.


Different
philosophical
,
religious
and
common
sense
approaches
to
conscience
have
emphasized
different
aspects
of
the
following
,
broad
characterization
:
through
our
individual
conscience
,
we
become
aware
of
our
deeply
held
moral
principles
,
we
are
motivated
to
act
upon
them
,
and
we
assess
our
character
,
our
behavior
and
ultimately
our
self
against
those
principles
.


The
resulting
more
specific
understandings
of
conscience
will
be
presented
in
the
sections
below
.


On
any
of
these
accounts
,
conscience
is
defined
by
its
inward
looking
and
subjective
character
,
in
the
following
sense
:
conscience
is
always
knowledge
of
ourselves
,
or
awareness
of
moral
principles
we
have
committed
to
,
or
assessment
of
ourselves
,
or
motivation
to
act
that
comes
from
within
us
(as
opposed
to
external
impositions)
.


This
inward
looking
and
subjective
character
of
conscience
is
also
reflected
in
the
etymological
relation
between
the
notion
of
“conscience”
and
that
of
consciousness
.


Only
after
the
17^(th)
Century
did
“consciousness”
start
to
be
used
with
a
distinct
meaning
referring
to
the
psychological
and
phenomenal
dimension
of
the
mind
,
rather
than
to
its
moral
dimension
(for
an
account
of
the
terminological
shift
,
see
Jorgensen
2014)
.



The
term
“conscience”
translates
the
Latin
“conscientia”
,
which
refers
to
sharing
“knowledge”
(scientia)
“with”
(con-)
,
and
which
in
turns
translates
the
equivalent
Greek
term
suneidenai
(see
Pierce
1955
and
Sorabji
2014
for
an
etymological
analysis
of
the
term)
.


The
literal
meaning
of
the
term
does
not
specify
the
type
of
knowledge
involved
and
whom
that
knowledge
is
shared
with
.


However
,
the
concept
has
traditionally
been
used
to
refer
to
moral
knowledge
(we
talk
indifferently
of
conscience
and
moral
conscience)
that
is
shared
with
oneself
.


This
reference
to
the
self
does
not
rule
out
that
the
source
of
the
morality
in
question
be
external
to
the
self
.


For
example
,
it
might
be
God
,
as
in
the
Christian
tradition
,
or
the
influence
of
one’s
culture
or
of
one’s
upbringing
,
as
in
the
Freudian
theory
of
the
Super-Ego
.


Reference
to
the
self
indicates
that
,
from
a
psychological
point
of
view
,
conscience
involves
introspection
,
awareness
of
one’s
behavior
,
and
self-assessment
.


As
we
shall
see
,
although
these
aspects
often
overlap
,
they
are
psychologically
and
conceptually
distinct
functions
.



“Sharing
moral
knowledge
with
oneself”
might
mean
and
imply
different
things
.


As
for
the
object
of
knowledge
,
for
example
,
it
might
refer
to
knowledge
of
one’s
own
conduct
in
view
of
an
assessment
of
it
against
a
certain
moral
standard
,
or
it
might
refer
to
knowledge
of
moral
standards
or
principles
themselves
.


As
for
the
“self”
with
whom
knowledge
is
shared
,
it
might
mean
sharing
knowledge
with
a
part
of
the
self
,
as
if
we
were
split
into
two
persons
(Sorabji
2014
:
12)
,
but
it
might
also
mean
sharing
knowledge
with
an
imaginary
witness
,
such
as
an
ideal
observer
(for
instance
a
god
,
an
imagined
moral
model
,
an
impartial
spectator)
.


Unfortunately
,
debates
in
which
appeals
to
conscience
are
often
made—for
example
the
debate
about
conscientious
objection
in
health
care—are
often
characterized
by
a
lack
of
clarity
as
to
what
it
exactly
is
that
we
are
talking
about
when
we
talk
about
conscience
,
and
therefore
about
what
exactly
people
are
claiming
when
they
put
forward
a
“conscientious
objection”
to
,
for
example
,
abortion
.


In
what
sense
does
abortion
violate
the
conscience
of
a
committed
Catholic
doctor
?


And
is
conscience
amenable
to
reason
and
public
discussion
,
or
are
appeals
to
conscience
ultimately
based
on
intuitions
and
private
morality
?


In
what
sense
is
a
conscientious
choice
different
from
a
mere
moral
preference
?


The
notion
of
conscience
is
in
need
of
conceptual
clarification
.



This
entry
will
expound
the
main
features
of
the
notion
of
conscience
as
it
is
used
in
philosophical
discussion
,
religious
teaching
and
in
common
language
alike
.


The
perspective
adopted
here
will
be
theoretical
,
rather
than
historical
.


The
entry
focuses
on
the
Western
tradition
and
some
examples
are
drawn
from
Christian
source
.


The
entry
is
structured
around
four
possible
,
but
not
mutually
exclusive
,
ways
of
conceptualizing
conscience
.


These
will
be
preceded
by
an
introductory
section
outlining
the
pluralistic
,
morally
neutral
and
subjective
nature
of
the
concept
of
conscience
.


The
four
main
aspects
of
conscience
that
will
be
described
are
the
following
.


Section
2
discusses
conscience
as
a
faculty
for
self-knowledge
and
self-assessment
.


Section
3
presents
the
epistemic
aspect
of
conscience
that
allows
the
formation
of
moral
beliefs
,
distinguishing
the
different
possible
sources
of
moral
principles
that
inform
such
beliefs
.


In
section
4
,
conscience
will
be
described
as
a
motivational
force
or
as
the
source
of
our
sense
of
duty
,
which
already
presupposes
a
body
of
moral
knowledge
or
of
moral
beliefs
.


Finally
,
section
5
will
focus
on
conscience
understood
as
the
body
of
personal
core
and
self-identifying
moral
beliefs
which
is
often
taken
to
be
the
basis
of
moral
integrity
(Fuss
1964
;
Wicclair
2011)
and
of
our
sense
of
personal
identity
(Childress
1979)
.


As
discussed
in
section
6
,
this
last
approach
to
conscience
is
often
used
with
a
political
function
to
advocate
freedom
of
thought
and
action
in
liberal
democratic
societies
,
for
example
,
as
explained
in
subsection
6

Conscience
as
pluralistic
,
neutral
and
subjective

The
concept
of
conscience
does
not
bear
any
connection
with
any
particular
substantial
moral
view
(Broad
1940)
.


The
voice
of
conscience
might
suggest
different
principles
and
different
behaviors
to
different
people
.


In
other
words
,
there
is
no
psychological
or
conceptual
relation
between
conscience
and
any
particular
moral
belief
.


However
,
as
will
be
explained
below
,
in
the
Catholic
tradition
the
idea
of
an
erroneous
conscience
is
sometimes
used
to
refer
to
conscience
that
fails
to
recognize
the
true
moral
laws
which
it
is
naturally
predisposed
to
“witness”
within
our
heart
.


As
for
secular
accounts
of
conscience
,
the
independence
of
the
notion
of
conscience
from
any
substantial
moral
content
can
be
understood
in
three
senses
.



First
,
conscience
is
a
pluralistic
notion
.


To
say
that
a
person
acted
with
conscience
or
that
something
violates
someone’s
conscience
does
not
entail
anything
about
what
this
act
consists
of
or
what
this
person’s
moral
values
are
(although
it
might
tell
us
that
conscience
is
itself
a
value
this
person
holds
dear)
.


To
use
a
metaphor
,
conscience
is
like
an
empty
box
that
can
be
filled
with
any
type
of
moral
content
.


As
put
by
Strohm
,


conscience
has
what
might
be
called
an
“identity
problem”—that
it

possesses
no
fixed
or
inherited
content
of
its
own
,
and
that
it
can
be

hailed
and
mobilized
in
defence
of
one
position
or
equally
in
defence

of
its
rival
.


(Strohm
2011
:
120)

For
example
,
while
some
health
practitioners
raise
“conscientious”
objection
to
abortion
and
refuse
to
provide
the
service
,
someone’s
conscience
might
demand
the
exact
opposite
,
i
.

e
.


,
to
perform
abortions
in
order
to
respect
what
is
conscientiously
believed
to
be
a
woman’s
right
(Joffe
1995)
.



Second
,
conscience
is
typically
a
morally
neutral
concept
.


Appealing
to
conscience
does
not
usually
add
anything
to
the
moral
justification
of
any
particular
conduct
or
principle
.


Unless
one
is
committed
to
the
relativistic
idea
that
your
belief
(or
your
conscience)
about
x
being
right
or
wrong
is
what
makes
it
right
or
wrong
for
you
to
do
x
(Foot
1979)
,
something
is
not
made
morally
better
or
worse
,
acceptable
or
unacceptable
,
simply
by
being
a
matter
of
conscience
.


For
example
,
the
morality
of
abortion
has
nothing
to
do
with
abortion
being
conscientiously
opposed
by
some
health
practitioners
or
conscientiously
supported
by
others
.


This
neutrality
does
not
exclude
,
however
,
that
an
appeal
to
conscience
can
represent
itself
as
a
reason
for
respecting
someone’s
moral
views
,
for
example
a
reason
for
granting
someone
a
right
to
object
to
carrying
out
certain
activities
.


While
appeals
to
conscience
do
not
typically
provide
any
moral
reason
in
defense
of
a
certain
moral
stance
(unless
one
is
a
relativist)
,
they
might
ground
political
reasons
for
respecting
individuals’
moral
beliefs
,
such
as
for
example
tolerance
or
pluralism
.



Finally
,
conscience
only
concerns
the
subjective
dimension
of
morality
.


Even
assuming
that
there
are
ethical
values
that
,
in
some
sense
,
can
be
considered
objective
,
conscience
only
refers
to
what
individuals
believe
,
independently
of
any
external
,
objective
proof
or
justification
.


And
when
people
state
what
they
subjectively
and
conscientiously
believe
,
they
acknowledge
that
other
people
might
(and
probably
will)
subjectively
and
conscientiously
hold
different
moral
views
.


Thus
,
when
I
say
that
abortion
violates
my
conscience
,
I
am
not
saying
(although
I
might
be
thinking)
that
abortion
is
morally
wrong
by
some
objective
standard
,
and
I’m
not
necessarily
trying
to
convince
others
that
abortion
is
wrong
by
some
objective
standard
.


I
am
simply
stating
what
I
deeply
believe
and
what
I
want
others
to
respect
as
my
conscientious
belief
,
regardless
of
how
good
or
bad
the
moral
reasons
I
can
provide
to
defend
my
claims
are
or
appear
to
be
to
others
(McGuire
1963
:
259)
.


In
fact
,
when
health
practitioners
claim
conscientious
objection
to
some
medical
procedures
,
they
are
usually
not
interested
in
preventing
other
doctors
who
hold
different
moral
beliefs
from
performing
the
procedure
.


They
are
usually
only
interested
in
,
so
to
speak
,
keeping
their
hands
clean
according
to
their
subjective
moral
standard
.



These
three
aspects
related
to
the
independence
of
conscience
from
particular
substantial
moral
views
explain
why
appeals
to
conscience
to
justify
one’s
behavior
are
usually
made
with
the
expectation
that
no
further
reason
for
the
behavior
in
question
be
required
.


As
put
by
Childress
,
when
an
agent
appeals
to
her
conscience
,


[u]sually
the
agent
has
given
up
the
attempt
to
convince
others
of
the

objective
rightness
of
his
act
and
is
content
to
assert
its
subjective

rightness
.


(Childress
1979
:
329)

Conscience
as
self-knowledge
and
self-assessment

When
we
talk
about
conscience
,
we
often
refer
to
reflection
about
ourselves
as
moral
persons
and
about
our
moral
conduct
.


Through
conscience
we
examine
ourselves
,
as
if
we
were
our
own
inner
judge
.


The
image
of
an
individual
split
into
two
persons
,
one
who
acts
and
the
other
who
observes
the
former’s
conduct
,
reflects
the
original
conception
of
“conscience”
in
the
Greek
world
,
at
least
from
the
5^(th)
century
BCE
(Sorabji
2014
:
12)
.


But
such
self-
knowledge
may
also
be
thought
of
as
shared
with
others
inside
of
us
,
such
as
God(s)
or
other
imaginary
witnesses
(for
example
an
admired
philosopher
according
to
Epicurus
(Sorabji
2014
:
24)
,
or
an
impartial
spectator
according
to
Adam
Smith
(1759))
.


The
god(s)
in
question
might
be
the
god(s)
of
a
particular
religion
,
such
as
the
God
of
Christianity
,
or
a
postulate
of
the
practical
reason
,
such
as
in
Kant
,
according
to
whom
reason
,
in
order
to
be
“practical”
in
the
sense
of
informing
moral
conduct
,
needs
the
idea
of
a
higher
authority
who
sanctions
individuals
for
their
actions
(Kant
1797)
.



The
role
of
conscience
in
this
sense
is
not
that
of
merely
gaining
knowledge
about
our
behavior
or
character
.


The
knowledge
in
question
is
typically
(though
,
as
explained
below
,
not
always)
the
ground
for
a
moral
assessment
by
conscience
.


When
observing
one’s
behavior
,
conscience
is
more
like
a
judge
(or
sometimes
it
is
identified
with
the
judgment
itself)
than
like
a
disinterested
observer
.


Thus
,
for
instance
,
the
impartial
spectator
with
which
Adam
Smith
identified
conscience
,
inspired
by
the
Stoic’s
notion
of
conscience
as
an
imagined
admired
philosopher
judging
one’s
conduct
,
is
not
a
morally
and
emotionally
neutral
observer
,
but
generates
a
sentiment
of
approval
or
disapproval
of
oneself
(Smith
1759
and
discussion
in
Raphael
2007
:
34)
.


Even
in
the
Catholic
view
,
where
the
main
characterization
of
conscience
is
that
of
a
witness
of
God’s
law
in
our
hearts
(as
described
in
section
3)
,
conscience
is
also
presented
as
“a
moral
judgment
about
man
and
his
actions
,
a
judgment
either
of
acquittal
or
condemnation”
(John
Paul
II
1993
:
59)
.


Analogously
,
in
the
Kantian
view
,
conscience
is
conceived
of
as
an
inner
court
(Wood
2008
:
184)
:
it
is
moral
self-awareness
that
allows
one
to
apply
the
moral
law
suggested
by
practical
reason
to
our
moral
conduct
,
and
to
judge
whether
we
have
complied
with
the
moral
law
.


As
Kant
defines
it
in
the
Metaphysics
of
Morals
,
conscience
is


practical
reason
holding
the
human
being’s
duty
before
him
for
his

acquittal
or
condemnation
in
every
case
that
comes
under
a
law
(Kant

1797
[1991
:
160])

and


consciousness
of
an
internal
court
in
man
.


(Kant
1797
[1991
:
189])

This
understanding
of
conscience
as
an
inner
court
is
well
illustrated
by
the
story
of
Huckleberry
Finn
in
Mark
Twain’s
famous
novel
(Twain
1884
;
Bennett
1974)
.


In
a
well-known
episode
of
the
novel
,
Huck
feels
guilty
and
blameworthy
for
having
helped
his
slave
friend
Jim
to
escape
from
his
owner
Miss
Watson
.


Blame
does
not
come
from
some
external
moral
authority
,
but
it
is
a
verdict
issued
by
conscience
according
to
its
moral
laws
.


The
bites
of
conscience
in
Huck’s
case
were
caused
by
a
tension
between
his
feelings
supporting
what
he
did
and
the
principles
he
had
inherited
from
his
social
environment
.


At
the
time
when
the
novel
is
set
,
slave-owning
was
considered
a
natural
type
of
possession
and
helping
slaves
run
away
meant
depriving
someone
of
her
private
property
.


This
was
the
“law”
(metaphorically
speaking)
against
which
Huck’s
conscience
assessed
his
behavior
.



This
story
illustrates
another
interesting
feature
of
conscience
as
a
faculty
for
self-assessment
,
i
.

e
.


,
the
asymmetry
between
our
confidence
in
the
validity
of
the
moral
standards
provided
by
our
own
conscience
and
our
confidence
in
the
validity
of
the
standards
provided
other
people’s
conscience
.


Huck
thinks
that
what
he
did
was
wrong
and
that
it
rendered
him
blameworthy
in
spite
of
his
feelings
,
because
he
thinks
that
his
own
conscience
provides
a
correct
moral
standard
,
i
.

e
.


,
a
standard
that
he
endorses
even
if
some
of
his
feelings
or
beliefs
indicate
otherwise
.


This
seems
to
reflect
our
common
way
of
relating
to
our
own
conscience
:
we
try
to
adjust
our
feelings
and
judgments
to
our
conscience’s
standard
,
rather
than
vice
versa
.


However
,
the
same
does
not
hold
when
we
talk
of
other
people’s
conscience
,
which
is
usually
taken
to
indicate
their
subjective
moral
standard
and
does
not
imply
that
we
are
endorsing
it
.


This
asymmetry
suggests
that
there
is
no
conceptual
relation
between
the
notion
of
conscience
per
se
and
the
notion
of
an
objective
or
correct
moral
standard
;
rather
,
it
stresses
once
more
the
fact
that
conscience
has
merely
to
do
with
one’s
private
morality
and
one’s
commitment
to
her
own
morality
.



Consistently
with
this
understanding
of
conscience
as
self-knowledge
and
self-assessment
,
it
has
been
suggested
by
some
that
psychopaths—i
.

e
.


,
pathological
subjects
who
display
antisocial
behavior
and
systematically
act
without
regard
to
what
they
consider
to
be
right
or
wrong—can
be
said
to
lack
conscience
(Hare
1999)
.


For
instance
,
according
to
Vujošević
(2015)
,
in
psychopaths
the
link
between
moral
knowledge
or
beliefs
and
self-directed
feelings
of
condemnation
(e
.

g
.


,
guilt)
is
broken
:
psychopaths
cannot
feel
the
remorse
that
normal
functioning
agents
feel
when
they
perceive
the
discrepancy
between
their
moral
beliefs
and
their
behavior
,
and
as
a
consequence
psychopaths
do
not
consider
themselves
accountable
for
their
actions
(Gudjonsson
and
Roberts
1983
;
Aharoni
et
al
.


2012)
,
although
their
moral
beliefs
are
often
“normal”
(Schaich
and
Sinnott-Armstrong
2013)

As
mentioned
above
in
this
section
,
when
expressing
itself
through
self-evaluative
feelings
,
conscience
might
be
conceived
of
as
either
constituted
by
such
feelings
(Fuss
1964)
or
as
occasioning
them
(Broad
1940)
.



In
the
former
sense
(conscience
as
constituted
by
self-evaluative
feelings)
,
the
feeling
is
an
essential
part
of
conscience
.


Conscience
in
this
case
is
better
conceived
not
as
a
judge
who
issues
sentences
,
but
as
a
feeling
with
cognitive
content—where
the
cognitive
content
concerns
the
adherence
of
one’s
behavior
to
a
certain
moral
standard
;
in
such
cases
,
the
negative
feeling
informs
me
that
what
I
am
doing
or
am
contemplating
doing
is
wrong
(according
to
my
own
moral
parameters)
.


In
the
latter
sense
(conscience
as
occasioning
self-evaluative
feelings)
,
the
inner
judge
,
when
in
tension
with
one’s
conduct
,
generates
negative
self-directed
feelings
(Mill
1861
:
ch
3)
.


For
instance
,
in
Freud
the
“Super-Ego”—the
part
of
our
personality
that
attends
to
prohibitions
,
inhibitions
and
moral
constraints—takes
“the
form
of
conscience”
to
exercise
its
control
over
one’s
impulses
and
instincts
by
producing
negative
evaluative
feelings
towards
the
individual
,
such
as
aggressiveness
towards
the
Ego
and
guilt
(Freud
1929
[2000
:
30])
.


As
we
shall
see
below
in
section
4
,
these
self-directed
negative
feelings
play
an
essential
role
in
fulfilling
the
motivational
function
of
conscience
.



As
the
characterization
of
conscience
as
self-assessment
here
presented
suggests
,
conscience
has
most
often
been
associated
with
negative
feelings
(Arendt
1971)
,
such
as
shame
,
guilt
,
fear
,
contrition
.


For
most
of
us
,
even
in
our
common
language
,
conscience
is
something
that
yields
negative
feelings
more
often
than
not—for
example
we
often
talk
of
the
“bites
of
conscience”
or
of
conscience
as
causing
us
“remorse”
(which
derives
from
the
Latin
“remordere”
,
i
.

e
.


,
“to
bite
again”)
.


However
,
a
joyful
conscience
that
praises
and
takes
pride
of
one’s
own
moral
merit
can
be
conceived
as
well
.


Examples
of
joyful
conscience
can
be
found
for
instance
in
Cicero
and
some
Latin
Stoics
,
most
prominently
Seneca
(Sorabji
2014
:
25–30)
.


Also
in
the
Protestant
tradition
started
by
Luther
we
find
the
idea
of
a
joyful
conscience
,
where
joy
springs
not
from
pride
or
self-praise
,
but
from
awareness
of
God’s
future
remission
of
sins
(Luther
1535
;
Calvin
1536)
.



The
contrast
between
the
Protestant
joyful
conscience
and
the
Catholic
conscience
burdened
by
negative
feelings
of
guilt
and
fear
was
emphasized
by
Luther
when
he
denounced
the
“terrorization
of
conscience”
by
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
.


According
to
Luther
,
with
this
terrorization
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
aimed
to
reinforce
its
authority
and
control
over
people’
conscience
.


In
fact
,
conscience
in
the
Catholic
tradition
can
only
be
relieved
from
its
burden
of
negative
feelings
through
the
confession
of
one’s
sins
to
a
priest
and
the
penitence
decided
by
that
priest
.

The
epistemic
function
of
conscience

Along
with
the
previous
,
non-epistemic
conception
of
conscience
,
we
can
also
understand
conscience
as
having
an
epistemic
function
.


In
this
sense
,
conscience
brings
us
some
form
of
moral
knowledge
or
moral
beliefs—either
in
an
absolute
sense
,
e
.

g
.


,
knowledge
of
divine
laws
,
or
in
a
relative
sense
,
e
.

g
.


,
knowledge
of
social
norms
in
one’s
culture
.



The
epistemic
role
of
conscience
does
not
necessarily
coincide
with
the
role
of
epistemic
faculties
or
functions
such
as
reason
,
intuitions
,
or
senses
.


In
particular
,
that
conscience
“brings”
us
moral
knowledge
or
beliefs
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
it
gives
us
direct
access
to
the
source
of
this
knowledge
or
of
these
beliefs
,
as
might
be
the
case
with
reason
,
intuitions
,
or
senses
.



The
knowledge
we
get
from
conscience
,
understood
as
possessing
an
epistemic
function
,
is
often
conceived
as
mediated
knowledge
.


This
is
not
surprising
,
since
,
as
we
have
seen
,
conscience
is
mostly
understood
as
inward
looking
,
which
presupposes
that
the
knowledge
to
which
it
gives
us
access
is
already
within
us
and
that
we
acquired
it
through
some
other
process
not
involving
conscience
.


In
fact
,
on
many
accounts
,
conscience
does
not
generate
its
own
moral
principles
.


For
example
,
the
moral
contents
we
discover
within
us
can
be
acquired
through
divine
intervention
,
as
is
the
case
with
the
laws
of
nature
which
,
according
to
Christians
,
God
infuses
in
our
heart
.


As
we
are
going
to
see
in
subsection
3
.

1
,
the
understanding
of
conscience
as
having
an
epistemic
function
and
as
the
recipient
of
mediated
knowledge
is
not
exclusive
to
religious
views
.



On
other
accounts
of
conscience
,
however
,
conscience
does
give
us
direct
access
to
moral
knowledge
,
for
example
as
an
intuition
about
what
is
good
and
what
is
bad
.



Let
us
examine
the
two
accounts
of
the
epistemic
role
of
conscience
in
more
detail
.

1
Conscience
as
a
faculty
for
indirect
moral
knowledge

In
the
Christian
tradition
,
starting
from
Paul
,
the
inward
looking
character
of
conscience
is
emphasized
by
the
metaphor
of
the
witness
(Romans
2
:
14–15)
.


Conscience
does
not
allow
us
to
acquire
the
knowledge
of
the
moral
law
directly
from
an
external
source
(God
in
this
case)
,
but
only
to
witness
the
presence
of
God’s
laws
within
us
.


Conscience
cannot
directly
contemplate
God
.


The
idea
of
a
faculty
that
gives
us
indirect
,
and
therefore
imperfect
knowledge
of
some
external
moral
authority
suits
religious
traditions
very
well
.


For
example
,
the
idea
that
through
conscience
we
discover
the
true
divine
laws
can
also
be
found
in
Islam
(Geaves
1999
:
164)
.



It
is
important
to
note
that
also
in
this
case
,
as
in
the
previous
understanding
of
conscience
as
self-awareness
and
self-assessment
,
conscience
can
be
conceived
as
fulfilling
an
introspective
function
,
i
.

e
.


,
as
being
directed
towards
the
self
and
towards
one’s
own
mental
states
.


Introspection
allows
one
to
gain
self-knowledge
(Schwitzgebel
2014)
,
but
since
the
self
which
is
observed
contains
the
moral
law
,
it
is
possible
to
say
that
the
law
itself
,
as
part
of
our
self
,
becomes
the
object
of
introspection
.


Thus
,
for
instance
,
in
his
theological
writings
before
his
papacy
,
Joseph
Ratzinger
said
that
“something
like
an
original
memory
of
the
good
and
the
true
(the
two
are
identical)
has
been
implanted
in
us”
,
and
conscience
is


so
to
speak
an
inner
sense
,
a
capacity
to
recall
,
so
that
the
one
whom

it
addresses
,
if
he
is
not
turned
in
on
himself
,
hears
its
echo
from

within
.


(Ratzinger
1991
[2010
:
535])

The
Catholic
Church
also
makes
reference
to
“the
voice
of
the
Lord
echoing
in
the
conscience
of
every
individual”
(John
Paul
II
1995
:
par
.


24)
.



On
this
account—since
conscience
is
only
a
witness
and
does
not
have
direct
epistemic
access
to
the
source
of
knowledge
,
i
.

e
.


,
to
God—conscience
is
considered
fallible
and
actually
often
erroneous
(1
Corinthians
4
:4
;
Aquinas
1265–1274
;
Butler
1726
:
sermon
3
(3))
.


In
particular
,
conscience
might
fail
to
correctly
interpret
the
divine
laws
when
applying
them
to
real
cases
.


According
to
some
13^(th)
Century
Catholic
theologians
,
such
as
Philip
the
Chancellor
,
Albert
the
Great
and
,
most
notably
,
Thomas
Aquinas
,
conscience
is
the
act
of
applying
universal
principles
(i
.

e
.


,
divine
laws)
to
real
situations
,
i
.

e
.


,
it
is
the
conclusion
of
the
practical
syllogism
whose
first
premise
is
a
universal
principle
provided
by
a
separate
faculty
called
“synderesis”
(Aquinas
,
Summa
Theologiae
,
1
q79
;
Langston
2000
and
2015
;
Sorabji
2014
:
62–66)
:
as
such
,
conscience
can
be
erroneous
in
deriving
moral
conclusions
from
first
principles
(Aquinas
,
On
Truth
,
q17
,
art
.


2
,
and
discussion
in
D’Arcy
1961
:
100–103)
.


However
,
other
Catholic
thinkers
have
emphasized
the
essential
role
of
conscience
in
humans
search
for
the
truth
.


Cardinal
John
Henry
Newman
,
for
instance
,
saw
conscience
as
the
moral
sense
that
can
lead
us
to
the
moral
truth
.


As
such
,
conscience
is
in
his
view
both
epistemic
and
action
guiding
,
but
the
two
aspects
are
not
distinguishable
,
to
the
extent
that
the
moral
truth
is
what
guides
our
actions
.


As
he
wrote
,
“The
feeling
of
conscience
…
is
twofold
:
it
is
a
moral
sense
,
and
a
sense
of
duty
;
a
judgment
of
the
reason
and
a
magisterial
dictate
.


Of
course
its
act
is
indivisible
;
still
it
has
these
two
aspects
,
distinct
from
each
other
,
and
admitting
of
a
separate
consideration”
(Newman
1870
,
101)

On
a
secular
account
,
the
external
source
of
moral
knowledge
that
instills
moral
principles
in
us
is
not
God
,
but
one’s
own
culture
or
upbringing
.


In
this
case
,
the
moral
knowledge
in
question
is
typically
understood
in
a
relativistic
sense
:
our
conscience
is
the
faculty
through
which
the
social
norms
of
our
culture
or
the
norms
of
our
upbringing
are
evoked
and
exert
their
influence
on
our
moral
psychology
.


These
norms
explain
our
moral
feelings
and
our
moral
choices
,
but
what
conscience
tells
us
in
this
case
is
the
product
of
social
and
cultural
dynamics
over
which
we
have
little
control
.


As
the
case
of
Huckleberry
Finn’s
conscience
demonstrates
,
hardly
can
conscience
so
understood
be
credited
any
moral
authority
,
since
our
educators
or
our
culture
might
be
highly
immoral
(for
example
our
conscience
might
end
up
drawing
on
racist
or
discriminatory
principles
,
such
as
the
ones
which
supported
slavery
in
Huck’s
social
environment)
.


And
in
fact
,
unsurprisingly
,
many
are
rather
skeptical
or
dismissive
of
the
moral
authority
of
conscience
,
since
they
see
it
as
mere
opinion
about
moral
principles
influenced
or
even
determined
by
one’s
own
culture
(Montaigne
1580
:
book
1
,
ch
.


22
;
Hobbes
1651
:
ch
.


7)
.


In
this
sense
,
conscience
is
a
merely
relativistic
notion
whose
content
changes
according
to
social
,
cultural
,
and
familial
circumstances
.

Conscience
as
a
faculty
for
direct
moral
knowledge

Contrary
to
what
Montaigne
and
Hobbes
had
claimed
,
Rousseau
argued
in
Emile
,
or
Education
that
good
education
can
free
conscience
from
the
corrupting
influences
of
societies
.


Actually
,
one
of
the
aims
of
education
is
to
render
the
young
autonomous
moral
thinkers
and
agents
by
teaching
them
how
to
critically
examine
and
,
if
necessary
,
replace
received
norms
(Rousseau
1762
;
see
Sorabji
2014
,
for
a
discussion)
.


The
idea
here
is
that
conscience
is
what
remains
of
our
innate
moral
sense
once
we
free
it
from
“childish
errors”
and
“prejudices
of
our
upbringing”
(Rousseau
1921
[1762]
:
253)
.


As
Rousseau
presents
it
,


There
is
therefore
at
the
bottom
of
our
hearts
an
innate
principle
of

justice
and
virtue
,
by
which
,
in
spite
of
our
maxims
,
we
judge
our
own

actions
or
those
of
others
to
be
good
or
evil
;
and
it
is
this

principle
that
I
call
conscience
.


(Rousseau
1921
[1762]
:
253)

According
to
Rousseau
,
then
,
conscience
has
a
natural
tendency
to
perceive
and
follow
the
right
order
of
nature
,
and
a
good
teacher
should
help
the
young’s
conscience
to
do
what
it
is
naturally
predisposed
to
do
.


In
Rousseau’s
words
:


Too
often
does
reason
deceive
us
;
we
have
only
too
good
a
right
to

doubt
her
;
but
conscience
never
deceives
us
;
she
is
the
true
guide
of

man
;
it
is
to
the
soul
what
instinct
is
to
the
body
;
he
who
obeys
his

conscience
is
following
nature
and
he
need
not
fear
that
he
will
go

astray…
Let
us
obey
the
call
of
nature
;
we
shall
see
that
her
yoke
is

easy
and
that
when
we
give
heed
to
her
voice
we
find
a
joy
in
the

answer
of
a
good
conscience
.


(Rousseau
1921
[1762]
:
252)

This
understanding
of
conscience
as
a
deeper
form
of
moral
knowledge
brings
us
to
the
second
sense
in
which
conscience
can
be
said
to
have
an
epistemic
role
.


As
well
as
merely
witnessing
received
opinions
or
divine
laws
,
conscience
can
also
be
conceived
as
a
moral
sense
giving
us
direct
access
to
moral
principles
.


Understood
in
this
way
,
conscience
is
typically
seen
as
intuitive
and
influenced
by
emotions
,
rather
than
a
reason-based
faculty
.


In
particular
,
18^(th)
Century
sentimentalist
philosophers
often
(e
.

g
.


,
Shaftesbury
(1711)
and
Hume
(1738–1740))
identified
conscience
with
a
moral
“sentiment”
or
moral
“sense”
.


According
to
Hume’s
psychological
theory
,
for
instance
,
“reason
is
wholly
inactive
and
can
never
be
the
source
of
so
active
a
principle
as
conscience
,
or
a
sense
of
morals”
(Hume
1738–1740
:
book
3
,
part
1
,
section
1)
.


Also
on
more
recent
accounts
of
conscience
and
of
private
morality
,
the
dictates
of
conscience
can
be
understood
as
expressions
of
our
moral
intuitions
.


According
to
Thagard
and
Finn
(2011)
,
for
instance
,
“conscience
is
a
kind
of
moral
intuition”
(p
.


168)
that
is
“both
cognitive
and
emotional”(p
.

156)
.



Once
again
,
there
are
reasons
to
doubt
the
epistemic
and
moral
authority
of
conscience
so
understood
.


A
lot
of
work
in
recent
moral
psychology
aimed
at
understanding
moral
disagreement
has
suggested
that
there
are
seemingly
irreconcilable
differences
in
fundamental
moral
intuitions
and
emotions
among
people
with
different
worldviews
(e
.

g
.


,
Haidt
2012
;
Greene
2013)
.


These
differences
in
fundamental
moral
intuitions
seem
to
undermine
the
epistemic
status
of
conscience
and
,
with
it
,
conscience’s
moral
authority
,
not
least
because
most
of
our
moral
intuitions
seem
,
according
to
these
recent
developments
in
moral
psychology
,
not
to
be
amenable
to
revision
in
light
of
new
evidence
or
new
good
reasons
.


Reasoning
,
on
any
plausible
account
,
should
be
an
important
part
of
morality
;
however
,
what
our
conscience
tells
us
may
have
little
to
do
with
reasons
and
evidence
.


Theoretical
work
in
moral
psychology
(e
.

g
.


,
Haidt
2012
;
Graham
et
al
.


2009
;
Haidt
2001)
,
supported
by
evidence
from
neuroscience
(Greene
2013)
,
suggests
that
our
most
fundamental
moral
beliefs
might
be
based
on
intuitions
and
emotions
over
which
our
rational
capacities
have
little
control
.


If
this
account
is
correct
,
then
we
have
reasons
to
be
skeptical
about
the
possibility
of
affecting
,
let
alone
changing
,
people’s
conscientious
beliefs
through
dialogue
,
public
discussion
and
reason
giving
.


Psychological
research
has
focused
particularly
on
the
differences
between
liberal
and
conservative
thinking
.


For
example
,
it
has
been
suggested
that
conservative
moral
and
political
views
are
often
founded
on
certain
specific
emotions
,
e
.

g
.


,
disgust
or
fears
,
and
specific
intuitions
,
e
.

g
.


,
intuitive
opposition
to
perceived
violations
of
purity
and
to
authority
subversion
,
whereas
liberal
views
are
often
driven
by
other
specific
emotions
,
e
.

g
.


,
anger
,
and
intuitions
,
e
.

g
.


,
intuitive
rejection
of
fairness
violations
or
liberty
infringements
(Haidt
2001
and
2012)
.


If
conscience
simply
is
the
expression
of
moral
intuition
,
and
if
individuals
have
significantly
different
and
irreconcilable
moral
intuitions
,
then
individuals
also
have
significantly
different
and
difficult-to-reconcile
conscientious
moral
consciences
.

Conscience
as
motivation
to
act
morally

Conscience
can
also
be
conceived
as
our
sense
of
duty
.


According
to
this
understanding
,
conscience
motivates
us
to
act
according
to
moral
principles
or
beliefs
we
already
possess
(e
.

g
.


,
D’Arcy
1963
;
Childress
1979
;
McGuire
1963
;
Fuss
1964)
.


Conscience
so
understood
“establishes
a
general
sense
of
moral
obligation
in
the
individual’s
consciousness”
(Fuss
1964
:
116)
.


The
subjective
character
of
conscience
implies
that
the
motivational
force
must
come
entirely
from
within
the
individual
,
as
opposed
to
sanctions
from
an
external
authority
.



A
powerful
motivational
source
is
represented
by
the
feelings
that
conscience
generates
in
its
self-assessment
function
.


As
we
said
at
the
beginning
,
the
different
understandings
of
conscience
presented
here
are
not
necessarily
mutually
exclusive
.


Conscience
as
self-assessment
and
conscience
as
motivation
to
act
morally
constitute
a
good
example
of
perspectives
on
conscience
which
are
not
only
consistent
with
one
another
,
but
which
actually
complete
one
another
.


In
Kant
,
for
example
,
the
theory
of
conscience
can
be
seen
as
“a
motivation
theory
set
in
the
context
of
a
reflection
theory”
(Wood
2008
:
183)
:
As
Wood
interprets
the
Kantian
notion
of
conscience
,
“conscience
is
a
feeling
of
pleasure
or
displeasure
associated
with
myself”
that
arises
when
I
comply
or
don’t
comply
with
moral
principles
and
that
motivates
me
to
act
in
one
sense
rather
than
the
other
when
the
feeling
accompanies
the
contemplation
of
a
certain
course
of
action
(Wood
2008
:
183–184)
.


Conscience
for
Kant
is
therefore
not
only
an
inner
court
,
but
also
a
source
of
motivation
to
act
morally
,
that
is
,
motivation
to
follow
our
sense
of
duty
as
determined
by
reason
(Kant
1797
[1991
:
161])
.



More
generally
,
as
we
have
seen
in
section
1
,
conscience’s
self-assessment
often
produces
remorse
or
other
negative
feelings
(guilt
,
shame
,
fear
,
and
so
on)
.


Our
desire
or
tendency
to
avoid
this
form
of
self-punishment
can
have
motivational
force
towards
acting
morally
.


Thus
,
for
instance
,
according
to
Childress
the
motive
for
acting
morally
that
defines
conscience
is
“in
part
,
avoidance
of
a
sanction
imposed
by
the
self
on
itself”
(Childress
1979
:
328)
.



Consistent
with
this
philosophical
view
are
studies
in
developmental
psychology
suggesting
that
the
emotion
of
guilt
,
which
is
typically
seen
as
one
of
the
products
of
conscience
as
self-assessment
,
is
“the
motivational
engine
that
infuses
misdeeds
with
negative
personal
valence”
(Kochanska
and
Aksan
2006
:
1589)
.


Transgression
generates
anxious
feelings
in
most
children
,
and
these
negative
feelings
help
children
suppress
future
wrongdoing
and
internalize
the
relative
moral
norms
(Damásio
1994
,
as
reported
in
Kochanska
and
Aksan
2006
:
1595)
.



However
,
at
the
same
time
,
the
negative
self-directed
feelings
must
themselves
be
generated
by
previous
experience
of
tension
between
our
action
and
a
pre-existing
sense
of
duty
.


Although
it
might
seem
that
we
are
stuck
in
an
infinite
regress
,
where
sense
of
duty
and
negative
self-directed
feelings
presuppose
one
another
,
this
need
not
be
the
case
.


It
is
possible
to
conceive
of
an
external
or
independent
source
of
that
most
fundamental
sense
of
duty
that
constitutes
our
conscience
,
such
as
for
example
our
moral
education
and
upbringing
(Mill
1861
:
ch
.


3)
.


But
the
sense
of
duty
that
identifies
a
conscientious
person
can
also
be
conceived
as
a
primitive
function
,
an
innate
disposition
which
is
not
explained
by
any
other
more
fundamental
mechanism
.


In
Kant
,
for
instance
,
“every
human
being
,
as
a
moral
being
,
has
a
conscience
within
him
originally”
(Kant
1797
[1991
:
160])
,
and
conscience
is
one
of
the
four
“natural
predispositions
of
the
mind
(…)
for
being
affected
by
concepts
of
duty”
,
the
other
three
being
moral
feeling
,
love
for
one’s
neighbors
,
and
respect
for
oneself
(Kant
1797
[1991
:
160])
.



Negative
feelings
and
sense
of
duty
are
not
always
successful
in
prompting
agents
to
do
what
their
moral
principles
require
.


But
the
“bites
of
conscience”
,
or
just
the
prospect
of
bites
of
conscience
,
act
as
motivational
force
towards
aligning
our
future
behavior
to
those
norms
.


Of
course
,
positive
feelings
associated
with
conscience
might
also
have
a
motivational
force
.


For
example
,
as
seen
above
,
Kant
associated
conscience
also
with
positive
feelings
about
oneself
when
the
agent
recognizes
he
has
acted
according
to
his
sense
of
duty
.


Rousseau
,
alongside
the
epistemic
account
of
conscience
presented
above
,
also
provides
in
Emile
a
motivational
account
of
conscience
based
on
positive
feelings
:
while
reason
gives
us
knowledge
of
the
good
,
it
is
conscience
,
through
a
sentiment
of
love
for
the
good
,
which
motivates
us
to
behave
morally
(Rousseau
1762)
.

Conscience
,
self-identifying
moral
commitments
,
and
moral
integrity

The
subjective
character
of
conscience
delimits
a
sphere
of
personal
morality
that
is
an
essential
part
of
our
sense
of
personal
identity
,
understood
as
our
sense
of
who
we
are
and
of
what
characterizes
qualitatively
our
individuality
(for
instance
,
our
character
,
our
psychological
traits
,
our
past
experience
,
etc
.

)
.


My
conscience
is
what
makes
me
this
particular
individual
in
a
social
and
cultural
context
that
I
want
to
keep
separate
from
me
.



This
private
space
in
which
the
individual
finds
her
own
sense
of
identity
often
grounds
the
political
use
of
the
notion
of
conscience
.


Thus
,
many
people
claim
the
right
to
stick
to
their
conscience—particularly
by
advancing
so
called
“conscientious
objection”—when
social
expectations
or
legal
obligations
would
demand
otherwise
.


These
political
appeals
to
conscience
are
usually
made
on
the
basis
of
two
principles
.


The
first
is
the
principle
of
respect
for
moral
integrity
,
which
finds
its
justification
in
the
close
relationship
between
the
notions
of
conscience
and
of
moral
integrity
on
one
side
(Childress
1979)
,
and
the
sense
of
personal
identity
on
the
other
.


The
second
principle
often
invoked
in
the
political
uses
of
“conscience”
is
the
principle
of
“freedom
of
conscience”
.


The
former
will
be
discussed
in
this
section
,
and
the
latter
in
the
next
section
.



The
concept
of
personal
identity
in
the
sense
in
which
the
notion
is
used
here—i
.

e
what
defines
me
as
this
particular
person
in
a
qualitative
sense—is
intimately
related
to
the
notions
of
conscience
(Wicclair
2011
;
Childress
1979)
and
of
moral
integrity
,
and
more
specifically
to
the
“identity
view
of
integrity”
(Cox
et
al
.


2013
;
Williams
1973
and
1981)
.


According
to
this
view
,
for
people
to
have
integrity
means
to
remain
faithful
to
“identity-conferring
commitments”
,
i
.

e
.


,
“commitments
that
people
identify
with
most
deeply
,
as
constituting
what
they
consider
their
life
is
fundamentally
about”
(Cox
et
al
.


2013)
.


This
identity-conferring
aspect
of
one’s
morality
is
exactly
what
some
people
call
“conscience”
.


According
to
Childress
,
for
example
,


[i]n
appealing
to
conscience
I
indicate
that
I
am
trying
to
preserve
a

sense
of
myself
,
my
wholeness
and
integrity
,
my
good
conscience
,
and

that
I
cannot
preserve
these
qualities
if
I
submit
to
certain

requirements
of
the
state
or
society
.


(Childress
1979
:
327)

Conscience
as
self-identifying
can
be
understood
in
two
ways
.


It
can
be
thought
of
either
as
a
set
of
core
and
self-identifying
moral
beliefs
that
are
“integral
to
an
agent’s
understanding
of
who
she
is
(i
.

e
.


,
her
self-conception
or
identity)”
(Wicclair
2011
:
4)
,
or
as
a
way
of
approaching
and
relating
to
such
moral
beliefs
,
i
.

e
.


,
a
“commitment
to
uphold
one’s
deepest
and
self-identifying
moral
beliefs”
(Sulmasy
2008
:
138)
and
“a
mode
of
consciousness
in
which
prospective
actions
are
viewed
in
relation
to
one’s
self
and
character”
(Bluestein
1993
:
294)
.



Conceived
in
either
way
,
conscience
is
an
essential
part
of
our
understanding
of
what
kind
of
person
we
are
,
and
this
is
taken
to
be
a
reason
for
warranting
protection
of
conscience
and
conscientious
objection
in
different
contexts
,
particularly
in
the
health
care
professions
(Wicclair
2011
:
25–26
;
Bluestein
1993
:
295)
.



We
have
seen
above
that
there
is
a
sense
in
which
,
according
to
some
,
psychopaths
can
be
said
to
lack
conscience
(Hare
1999)
:
psychopaths
are
not
capable
of
connecting
their
moral
knowledge
to
their
conduct
through
the
feelings
of
guilt
and
disapproval
which
conscience
,
on
some
accounts
,
produces
.


Interestingly
,
according
to
some
psychologists
,
psychopaths
are
also
less
likely
to
base
their
sense
of
personal
identity
on
moral
traits
than
normal
functioning
individuals
(Glenn
et
al
.


2010)
.


More
recent
psychological
studies
have
suggested
that
people
tend
to
link
the
identity
of
others
not
so
much
to
their
memories
,
as
traditionally
believed
,
but
to
their
morals
:
it
is
the
loss
of
one’s
moral
character
and
moral
beliefs
,
rather
than
of
one’s
memory
,
that
leads
us
to
say
that
a
certain
individual
is
not
the
same
person
anymore
(Strohminger
and
Nichols
2015)
.


These
findings
provide
empirical
support
to
the
idea
that
conscience
is
essential
to
one’s
sense
of
personal
identity
and
to
attributions
of
personal
identity

.


Freedom
of
conscience

Some
people
have
suggested
that
appeals
to
freedom
of
conscience
tend
to
be
more
vigorously
put
forward
and
more
effective
in
contexts
where
political
or
religious
structures
lose
power
or
moral
authority
.


Thus
,
for
instance
,
according
to
C
.

A
.


Pierce
:


conscience
only
came
into
its
own
in
the
Greek
world
after
the

collapse
of
the
city-state
.


The
close
integration
of
politics
with

ethics
,
with
the
former
predominant
,
was
no
longer
possible
:
there
was

no
sufficiently
close
authority
,
external
to
the
individual
,

effectively
to
direct
conduct
.


Consequently
,
as
a
pis
aller
,
men
fell

back
on
the
internal
chastisement
of
the
conscience
as
the
only

authority
.


(Pierce
1955
:
76)

The
same
can
be
said
for
17^(th)
Century
England
,
with
its
crisis
of
religious
authority
and
the
frequent
appeals
to
freedom
of
conscience
in
the
philosophical
and
political
literature
of
that
time
(Childress
1979
:
326)
.



There
are
three
main
arguments
that
can
be
used
to
defend
a
principle
of
freedom
of
conscience
.


Two
of
them
are
frequently
found
in
the
16^(th)
and
17^(th)
Century
philosophical
literature
:
they
are
the
“argument
from
ineffectiveness
or
hypocrisy”
and
the
“argument
from
ignorance”
(Sorabji
2014
:
139)
.


A
third
argument
,
which
might
be
called
“argument
from
legitimization”
,
was
put
forward
by
John
Stuart
Mill
.


Let
us
examine
them
in
order
.



a)
The
argument
from
ineffectiveness
or
hypocrisy
is
based
on
the
relevance
of
the
distinction
between
beliefs
and
acts
for
the
definition
of
conscience
.


According
to
this
argument
,
it
is
not
possible
to
compel
someone
to
believe
or
to
not
believe
something
,
i
.

e
.


,
to
change
one’s
conscientious
beliefs
.


All
we
can
do
is
compel
people
to
act
as
if
they
believed
something
,
which
would
be
a
hypocritical
behavior
.


Therefore
,
if
some
authority
aims
to
convert
people
or
to
change
people’s
moral
views
,
prohibiting
the
free
expression
,
through
actions
,
of
one’s
conscience
would
not
serve
this
purpose
.



This
line
of
argument
was
often
put
forward
by
early
Christians
,
most
notably
Christian
apologist
Tertullian
,
to
defend
their
freedom
to
practice
their
cult
in
a
time
where
they
were
persecuted
by
Roman
governors
:
their
claim
was
that
forcing
them
to
abandon
the
Christian
cults
would
have
no
effect
on
their
conscience
.


The
same
line
of
argument
can
also
be
found
in
Locke’s
works
on
toleration
,
the
Essay
Concerning
Toleration
of
1667
and
A
Letter
Concerning
Toleration
of
1689
.



However
,
Christians
did
not
seem
to
believe
in
the
force
of
this
argument
,
and
more
generally
in
the
principle
of
freedom
of
conscience
,
when
,
later
on
,
they
attempted
to
justify
the
violent
persecution
of
heretics
(those
who
revise
their
religious
dogmas)
and
apostates
(those
who
abandon
their
religion)
and
their
forced
conversion
(Clarke
2014
:
118–123)
.


Two
main
justifications
have
been
given
by
Christian
theologians
for
the
forced
conversion
of
heretics
and
apostates
.



One
can
be
found
,
among
others
,
in
Aquinas
and
Calvin
,
who
thought
that
violent
persecution
is
justified
because
heretics’
mistaken
views
would
exert
great
influence
on
many
ordinary
people
.


By
departing
from
the
Christian
doctrine
,
these
people
would
be
condemned
to
eternal
damnation
in
the
afterlife
,
and
Christians
have
a
duty
to
save
as
many
people
as
possible
from
eternal
damnation
(Clarke
2014
:
120–121)
.



A
second
type
of
argument
in
defense
of
violent
persecution
is
the
one
offered
by
Augustine
(5^(th)
Century)
.


He
argued
that
compelling
people
to
follow
the
true
religion—by
which
he
meant
persecuting
heretics—could
open
their
eyes
to
the
truth
(Sorabji
2014
:
49–50)
.


This
thesis
implies
that
sometimes
conscience
,
even
if
we
confine
it
to
matters
of
inward
conviction
and
not
to
behavior
,
can
be
influenced
by
some
external
imposition
.



This
latter
approach
based
on
the
idea
of
bringing
the
truth
to
conscience
by
“freeing”
conscience
from
error
is
consistent
with
the
Catholic
peculiar
understanding
of
the
notion
of
freedom
of
conscience
.


Philosophically
speaking
,
“freedom
of
conscience”
is
typically
understood
as
an
individualistic
concept
that
allows
for
a
plurality
of
moral
and
religious
views
(Strohm
2011
:
90)
.


For
the
Catholic
Church
,
however
,
authentic
freedom
is
inseparable
from
the
notion
of
truth
.


Inspired
by
the
works
of
the
English
theologian
and
cardinal
John
Henry
Newman
,
Joseph
Ratzinger
writes
that
in
the
Catholic
view
“truth”
is
the
middle
term
that
reconciles
authority
of
God
and
subjectivity
of
conscience
:
the
latter
,
when
authentically
free
,
cannot
but
reveal
the
truth
established
by
the
former
(Ratzinger
1991
[2010])
.


Since
,
as
we
have
seen
above
,
in
the
Catholic
view
reason
alone
can’t
create
its
own
values
,
which
are
instilled
by
God
into
humans’
hearts
,
“human
freedom
finds
its
authentic
and
complete
fulfillment
precisely
in
the
acceptance
of
that
law”
of
God
(John
Paul
II
1993
:
par
.


35)
.


So
when
practical
reason
is
free
to
exercise
its
“participation”
(John
Paul
II
1993
:
sec
.


40)
in
the
divine
law
,
then
“in
the
depths
of
his
conscience
,
man
detects
a
law
which
he
does
not
impose
upon
himself
,
but
which
holds
him
to
obedience”
(Paul
VI
1965
:
par
.


16)
.



In
any
case
,
it
is
not
necessary
to
dismiss
the
argument
from
ineffectiveness
in
order
to
justify
imposing
norms
and
practices
that
might
violate
individuals’
conscience
.


Actually
,
the
same
argument
from
ineffectiveness
can
be
used
to
support
the
imposition
of
policies
that
might
conflict
with
individuals’
consciences
.


On
the
basis
of
the
idea
that
conscience
is
merely
a
matter
of
private
beliefs
,
not
of
action
,
some
authors
have
argued
that
compelling
people
to
follow
certain
rules
even
against
their
conscience
would
not
constitute
a
violation
of
their
freedom
of
conscience
,
and
is
therefore
justifiable
.


This
was
the
line
of
argument
pursued
,
for
example
,
by
Thomas
Hobbes
(1651
:
chapter
40)
,
Baruch
Spinoza
(1670
:
chapter
20)
and
John
Locke
(1660)
,
who
argued
that
the
State
has
the
power
to
enforce
certain
practices
even
when
citizens
claim
that
it
would
violate
their
conscience
,
in
order
to
protect
social
order
.



b)
The
“argument
from
ignorance”
,
which
might
be
better
labeled
“argument
from
humility”
,
is
based
on
a
skeptical
approach
to
the
content
of
conscience
.


The
possibility
exists
that
what
we
conscientiously
believe
is
wrong
and
that
those
holding
conscientious
beliefs
opposite
to
ours
are
right
.


Therefore
,
there
is
a
reason
for
not
forcing
anyone
to
believe
in
something
or
to
engage
in
behaviors
that
might
turn
out
to
be
morally
wrong
.


The
argument
from
ignorance
or
humility
started
to
be
put
forward
quite
frequently
,
and
most
prominently
by
Pierre
Bayle
(1686–1688)
,
after
the
Catholic
Church
lost
a
significant
proportion
of
its
religious
and
moral
authority
following
the
Protestant
reform
in
16^(th)
and
17^(th)
Century—which
was
defined
by
Keith
Thomas
(1993)
as
“the
age
of
conscience”
.


It
was
at
that
time
that
we
assisted
to
the
“secularization
of
conscience”
in
the
modern
era
(Strohm
2011)
,
although
the
phenomenon
would
be
better
conceived
of
as
a
“re-secularization”
,
since
conscience
was
not
related
to
the
voice
or
the
authority
of
God
in
the
Greek
world
.



The
same
argument
from
ignorance
or
from
humility
is
also
put
forward
by
John
Locke
in
his
Second
Letter
Concerning
Toleration
.


Locke
had
to
rely
on
this
argument
as
an
alternative
strategy
to
defend
freedom
of
conscience
after
the
Anglican
priest
Jonas
Proast
pointed
out
that
compulsion
can
actually
change
personal
beliefs
(as
Augustine
had
argued)
,
and
that
therefore
the
argument
from
ineffectiveness
that
Locke
had
used
in
his
first
Letter
fails
(Sorabji
2014
:
151)
.



A
version
of
the
argument
from
ignorance
can
also
be
found
in
contemporary
defenses
of
conscientious
objection
in
an
age
where
pluralism
of
worldviews
is
acknowledged
and
actually
supported
.


For
example
,
Sulmasy
appeals
to
epistemic
humility
as
“true
basis
of
tolerance”
(Sulmasy
2008
:
144)
in
his
arguments
in
support
of
a
right
to
conscientious
objection
in
health
care
.



c)
Finally
,
the
third
argument
in
defense
of
freedom
of
conscience
is
what
I
have
called
above
the
“argument
from
legitimization”
.


John
Stuart
Mill
(1859)
defended
freedom
of
conscience
by
appealing
to
the
idea
that
allowing
the
free
expression
of
any
opinion
,
and
particularly
mistaken
opinions
,
would
allow
truth
to
emerge
more
clearly
and
would
provide
us
with
a
justification
for
acting
upon
our
own
beliefs
,
once
they
have
been
assessed
against
others’
opinions
.


As
put
by
Mill
,


[c]omplete
liberty
of
contradicting
and
disproving
our
opinion
,
is
the

very
condition
which
justifies
us
in
assuming
its
truth
for
purposes

of
action
;
and
on
no
other
terms
can
a
being
with
human
faculties
have

any
rational
assurance
of
being
right
.


(Mill
1859
:
ch

Freedom
of
conscience
and
conscientious
objection
today

Freedom
of
conscience
is
today
protected
by
the
United
Nations
Universal
Declaration
of
Human
Rights
,
which
reads
:
“Everyone
has
the
right
to
freedom
of
thought
,
conscience
and
religion”
(art
.


18)
.



According
to
Strohm
,
this
article
should
not
be
taken
to
imply
freedom
to
act
according
to
one’s
conscience
,
but
it
only
refers
to
“matters
of
inward
conviction”
(Strohm
2011
:
88)
.


If
this
interpretation
is
correct
,
article
18
does
not
seem
to
raise
any
interesting
philosophical
or
practical
problem
today
,
as
very
few
people
today
would
deny
freedom
in
matters
of
inward
conviction
.


More
problematic
is
the
moral
and
political
debate
about
the
freedom
to
act
,
or
to
refrain
from
acting
,
according
to
one’s
conscience
,
especially
where
there
are
professional
roles
or
legal
obligations
that
would
demand
otherwise
.


In
fact
,
appeals
to
conscience
and
freedom
of
conscience
are
often
deployed
to
claim
and
justify
“conscientious
objection”
to
certain
activities
that
someone
would
otherwise
be
required
to
perform
.



One
example
is
conscientious
objection
to
the
military
service
where
conscription
is
in
place
.


Although
originally
conscientious
objection
to
war
was
mainly
a
religious
issue
(the
Quakers
were
the
most
famous
group
of
conscientious
objectors
to
war)
,
in
more
recent
times
the
objection
to
war
has
been
put
forward
and
granted
without
explicit
reference
to
any
religious
justification
(Moskos
and
Chamber
1993)
.



As
most
States
have
now
abolished
conscription
,
appeals
to
freedom
of
conscience
and
to
conscientious
objection
today
can
be
found
mainly
in
debates
in
medical
ethics
with
regard
to
health
practitioners
who
conscientiously
object
to
performing
medical
procedures
they
morally
oppose
,
such
as
abortions
(for
overviews
of
the
debate
in
medical
ethics
,
see
Wicclair
2011
;
Wester
2015)
.



According
to
those
who
are
against
a
right
to
conscientious
objection
,
professional
obligations
trump
any
value
conscience
might
have
and
any
principle
that
might
justify
conscientious
objection
qua
conscientious
(e
.

g
.


,
Giubilini
,
Schuklenk
,
Minerva
,
and
Savulescu
2025
;
Savulescu
and
Schuklenk
2017)
;
according
to
defenders
of
conscientious
objection
,
professionals’
conscience
must
be
protected
to
the
largest
extent
possible
,
i
.

e
.


,
up
to
the
point
where
respecting
conscience
would
significantly
jeopardize
physical
or
psychological
health
of
patients
(e
.

g
.


,
Sulmasy
2008
;
Wicclair
2011)
,
a
compromise
that
,
depending
on
circumstances—for
example
a
too
high
percentage
of
objecting
practitioners
which
would
make
it
nearly
impossible
to
refer
patients
to
non-objecting
doctors—might
be
very
difficult
to
achieve
(Minerva
2015)
.


Between
these
two
stances
,
there
are
positions
that
are
neither
for
nor
against
conscientious
objection
in
principle
,
but
pose
tighter
restrictions
to
those
who
advance
conscientious
objection
(McLeod
2020)
,
for
example
the
requirement
to
provide
reasons
for
the
objection
,
and
to
submit
such
reasons
to
public
scrutiny
or
experts’
assessment
of
the
reasonability
of
one’s
objection
(Card
2007
,
Card
2020)
,
or
the
qualification
that
objection
can
only
be
justified
if
consistent
with
the
internal
values
of
the
profession
(Wicclair
2000
;
Deans
2013)
.



However
,
if
it
is
the
validity
or
the
soundness
of
the
reasons
provided
which
is
considered
relevant
for
the
justification
of
conscientious
objection
,
it
seems
that
the
value
of
conscience
and
the
principle
of
freedom
of
conscience
are
no
longer
at
stake
.


What
makes
an
objection
good
or
bad
,
acceptable
or
unacceptable
,
has
nothing
to
do
with
its
being
conscientious
,
unless
we
add
a
“genuineness
requirement”
(e
.

g
.


,
Meyers
and
Woods
1996)
to
an
assessment
of
the
legitimacy
of
a
conscientious
objection
,
whereby
professionals
need
to
demonstrate
that
the
moral
beliefs
at
stake
are
deeply
and
sincerity
held
.


The
interesting
question
in
this
case
would
be
whether
a
test
can
be
devised
that
can
reliably
track
genuine
conscientious
objections
.

Conclusion

There
is
no
such
a
thing
as
the
notion
of
conscience
,
both
in
a
philosophical
and
in
a
psychological
sense
.


As
we
have
seen
,
the
concept
of
conscience
has
been
given
different
interpretations
throughout
history
,
sometimes
on
the
basis
of
underlying
systematic
philosophical
theories
of
the
mind
and
of
morality
,
and
sometimes
serving
religious
or
political
purposes
.



This
lack
of
uniformity
is
not
only
a
problem
for
historians
and
theoretical
philosophers
.


Because
it
cannot
be
immediately
clear
what
we
are
talking
about
when
we
talk
of
conscience
,
of
freedom
of
conscience
,
or
of
conscientious
objection
,
it
is
important
that
clarity
is
made
every
time
conscience
is
appealed
to
in
different
branches
of
applied
philosophy
(particularly
medical
ethics)
and
in
public
debates
alike
.



This
entry
has
presented
a
conceptual
map
,
rather
than
a
historical
account
,
of
conscience
,
which
can
provide
some
guidance
for
those
engaged
in
this
clarificatory
task
.


One
of
the
benefits
of
clarifying
concepts
,
and
clarifying
them
in
the
different
circumstances
in
which
they
are
used
,
is
their
subsequent
demystification
.



Conscience
needs
to
be
demystified
,
since
it
is
one
of
those
concepts
that
tend
to
elicit
reverence
rather
than
questions
or
an
interest
in
further
inquiry
.


As
seen
above
,
appeals
to
conscience
often
replace
reason
giving
and
are
made
with
the
expectation
that
no
further
reason
for
one’s
decisions
and
positions
is
requested
.


This
attitude
is
also
displayed
in
many
legislative
approaches
dealing
with
the
notion
of
conscience
;
in
particular
,
legislations
about
conscientious
objection
in
health
care
typically
grant
doctors
a
right
to
object
to
performing
certain
professional
activities
(e
.

g
.


,
conscientious
objection
to
abortion)
without
requiring
them
to
provide
reasons
for
their
objection
,
let
alone
submitting
reasons
to
some
form
of
assessment
.



This
entry
has
distinguished
four
main
understandings
of
conscience
,
drawing
on
the
philosophical
tradition
of
the
concept
.


Whether
the
concept
is
to
be
understood
as
a
faculty
for
self-knowledge
and
self-assessment
,
or
as
having
an
epistemic
function
in
the
sphere
of
morality
,
or
as
a
motivational
force
,
or
again
as
a
set
of
self-identifying
moral
beliefs
,
or
a
combination
of
any
of
these
characterizations
,
it
is
important
to
have
clear
in
mind
what
exactly
we
are
talking
about
when
we
talk
of
conscience
and
of
freedom
of
conscience
in
each
circumstance
.



Far
from
being
a
conversation-stopper
,
conscience
can
only
find
its
proper
place
in
philosophical
and
in
public
discussion
if
its
philosophical
and
psychological
aspects
are
teased
out
,
defined
and
assessed
.


Appeals
to
conscience
can
only
be
part
of
philosophical
,
political
,
and
legal
discussion
if
they
are
seen
as
the
start
,
not
the
end
of
discussions
.

[Tumisu/Pixabay]

Tumisu/Pixabay

Few
novelists
have
captured
the
ultimate
ambiguity
of
conscience
better
than
Mark
Twain
did
in
Huckleberry
Finn
.


Jim
,
the
escaped
slave
who
accompanies
Huck
down
the
river
on
a
raft
,
is
on
a
journey
to
reunite
with
his
beloved
family
(whom
white
people
have
separated
from
him)
.


In
several
scenes
,
Huck
,
beset
with
guilt
for
not
handing
Jim
over
to
the
authorities
as
his
conscience
naggingly
instructs
him
to
,
anguishes
over
his
default
role
as
an
escapee
'
s
accomplice
.



Finally
,
subconsciously
recognizing
Jim
not
only
as
the
devoted
,
concerned
father
figure
he
never
had
but
in
many
ways
as
a
paragon
of
virtue
,
despite
the
color
of
his
skin
,
Huck
decides
to
disobey
his
conscience
.


In
doing
so
,
he
demonstrates
the
courage
many
literary
critics
have
cited
as
constituting
the
novel
'
s
moral
climax
:


I
was
a-trembling
,
because
I
'
d
got
to
decide
,
forever
,
betwixt
two

things
,
and
I
knowed
it
.


I
studied
a
minute
,
sort
of
holding
my

breath
,
and
then
says
to
myself
:
"Alright
then
,
I
'
ll
go
to
hell
.

"

In
addition
,
note
these
two
later
passages
,
which
also
explain
indirectly
why
Twain
would
have
readers
question
the
racist
messages
endemic
to
a
prejudicial
society
:


It
don
'
t
make
no
difference
whether
you
do
right
or
wrong
,
a
person
'
s

conscience
ain
'
t
got
no
sense
,
and
just
goes
for
him
anyway
.



But
because
Huck
isn
'
t
yet
mature
or
free-thinking
enough
to
triumph
over
the
cultural
bias
of
the
culture
that
'
s
"educated"
him
,
he
'
s
compelled
to
rationalize
his
decision
to
protect
Jim
through
some
curious
verbal
gymnastics
,
namely
:


I
knowed
he
[Jim]
was
white
inside
.



To
employ
Freud
'
s
terminology
,
Huck
is
coming
from
his
id
,
doing
what
by
nature
he
'
s
drawn
to
do
while
forcefully
resisting
the
strong
gravitational
pull
of
his
guilt-inducing
superego
.


But
when
these
brief
excerpts
are
explored
in
the
context
of
Twain
'
s
general
handling
of
whites
in
the
novel
,
it
'
s
obvious
that
(as
traditionally
understood)
Twain
has
interchanged
id
and
superego
.



Metaphorically
,
that
is
,
the
connotations
of
whiteness
are
quite
black—and
black
,
ironically
,
has
been
transposed
with
white
.


What
Twain
characterizes
is
that
a
slave
can
exemplify
all
that
'
s
most
admirable
in
humanity
while
the
(purportedly)
most
"lily-white"
individuals
may
indeed
illustrate
the
reverse
.



For
Huck
to
act
"conscientiously
,"
by
denying
Jim
his
personal
freedom—which
,
despite
tremendous
personal
risks
,
Jim
so
desperately
seeks
because
of
his
dedication
to
his
wife
and
children—would
be
to
mirror
his
society
'
s
corrupted
conscience
.


Huck
'
s
safeguarding
of
Jim
from
all
the
people
who
'
d
prefer
(primarily
for
ignoble
reasons)
to
return
him
to
slavery
can
be
comprehended
as
depicting
a
true
versus
an
artificial
,
culturally-derived
conscience
.



Ernest
Hemingway
,
deeply
influenced
by
Twain
'
s
plain-spoken
style
and
exemplifying
a
similar
interest
in
discovering
how
best
to
distinguish
between
virtuous
and
villainous
behavior
,
offers
this
reality-based
solution
in
Death
in
the
Afternoon
:


What
is
moral
is
what
you
feel
good
after
,
and
what
is
immoral
is
what

you
feel
bad
after
.



Here
,
too
,
we
'
re
presented
with
an
idealistically
pragmatic
perspective
deviating
from
the
far
more
conventional
morals
or
mores
of
society
.


Hemingway
'
s
position
is
that
deciding
how
to
evaluate
the
ethical
ramifications
of
behavior
ought
to
be
based
on
personal
,
reality-derived
sentiment
.


It
'
s
a
matter
of
trusting
one
'
s
authentic
feelings
rather
than
what
one
has
absorbed
unconsciously
,
both
from
how
their
family
raised
them
and
the
moral
consensus
of
their
culture
.

Struggles

Writers
worldwide
have
historically
questioned
popular
assumptions
about
the
fixed
nature
of
good
and
evil
.


So
these
two
authors
can
be
seen
as
representative
of
so
many
writers
who
came
to
regard
accepted
definitions
of
morality
as
simplistic—and
frequently
false
.



Defining
conscience
from
a
religious
perspective

Let
'
s
now
look
at
customary
definitions
of
conscience
to
illustrate
how
they
stop
short
of
accounting
for
the
many
ambiguities
so
often
found
in
reality
,
for
what
'
s
ideal
and
what
'
s
practically
possible
can
at
times
be
worlds
apart—as
can
the
gulf
between
what
people
aspire
to
and
what
they
'
re
actually
capable
of
.



The
literature
online
relating
particularly
to
the
oxymoronic
concept
of
an
evil
conscience
emanates
mostly
from
theology—and
we
'
ll
deal
with
this
orientation
first
.


The
approach
that
fundamentalist
religion
takes
toward
ethics
is
absolutist
,
placing
a
person
'
s
behavior
into
neat
,
generally
unqualified
categories
.


For
example
,
in
a
sermon
marshaling
all
of
its
supporting
evidence
from
Scriptures
,
Greg
Stuckey
defines
any
human
wrongdoing
as—purely
and
simply—evil
.


So
anyone
afflicted
with
such
a
presumed
immoral
conscience
will
experience
as
good
what
the
Bible
delineates
as
evil
,
and
vice
versa
.



Defining
such
people
as
sociopathic
(though
without
employing
this
secular
terminology)
,
Stuckey
posits
that
they
glory
in
and
brag
about
precisely
what
they
should
be
ashamed
of
.


Rather
than
feeling
troubled
by
hurting
others
,
they
perversely
take
joy
in
it
.


Looked
at
from
this
dogmatic
ecclesiastical
stance
,
an
evil
conscience
is
synonymous
with
sinning
against
God—and
it
requires
paying
penance
to
God
if
one
is
to
be
forgiven
.



In
my
next
post
,
I
'
ll
explore
this
seminal
topic
from
a
secular
point
of
view
and
also
explore
the
curious
moral
ambiguity
of
the
superego
.


And
my
final
post
on
this
subject
will
get
into
the
moral
rationalizations
people
offer
for
bad
behavior
which
they
can
'
t—or
won
'
t—own
up
to
.

A
conscience
is
a
cognitive
process
that
elicits
emotion
and
rational
associations
based
on
an
individual
'
s
moral
philosophy
or
value
system
.


Conscience
stands
in
contrast
to
elicited
emotion
or
thought
due
to
associations
based
on
immediate
sensory
perceptions
and
reflexive
responses
,
as
in
sympathetic
central
nervous
system
responses
.


In
common
terms
,
conscience
is
often
described
as
leading
to
feelings
of
remorse
when
a
person
commits
an
act
that
conflicts
with
their
moral
values
.


The
extent
to
which
conscience
informs
moral
judgment
before
an
action
and
whether
such
moral
judgments
are
or
should
be
based
on
reason
has
occasioned
debate
through
much
of
modern
history
between
theories
of
basics
in
ethic
of
human
life
in
juxtaposition
to
the
theories
of
romanticism
and
other
reactionary
movements
after
the
end
of
the
Middle
Ages
.



Religious
views
of
conscience
usually
see
it
as
linked
to
a
morality
inherent
in
all
humans
,
to
a
beneficent
universe
and/or
to
divinity
.


The
diverse
ritualistic
,
mythical
,
doctrinal
,
legal
,
institutional
and
material
features
of
religion
may
not
necessarily
cohere
with
experiential
,
emotive
,
spiritual
or
contemplative
considerations
about
the
origin
and
operation
of
conscience
.

^([1])
Common
secular
or
scientific
views
regard
the
capacity
for
conscience
as
probably
genetically
determined
,
with
its
subject
probably
learned
or
imprinted
as
part
of
a
culture
.

^([2])

Commonly
used
metaphors
for
conscience
include
the
"voice
within"
,
the
"inner
light"
,^([3])
or
even
Socrates
'

reliance
on
what
the
Greeks
called
his
"daimōnic
sign"
,
an
averting
(ἀποτρεπτικός
apotreptikos)
inner
voice
heard
only
when
he
was
about
to
make
a
mistake
.


Conscience
,
as
is
detailed
in
sections
below
,
is
a
concept
in
national
and
international
law
,^([4])
is
increasingly
conceived
of
as
applying
to
the
world
as
a
whole
,^([5])
has
motivated
numerous
notable
acts
for
the
public
good^([6])
and
been
the
subject
of
many
prominent
examples
of
literature
,
music
and
film
.

Seated
Buddha
,
Gandhara
,
2nd
century
CE
.


The
Buddha
linked
conscience
with
compassion
for
those
who
must
endure
cravings
and
suffering
in
the
world
until
right
conduct
culminates
in
right
mindfulness
and
right
contemplation
.



In
the
literary
traditions
of
the
Upanishads
,
Brahma
Sutras
and
the
Bhagavad
Gita
,
conscience
is
the
label
given
to
attributes
composing
knowledge
about
good
and
evil
,
that
a
soul
acquires
from
the
completion
of
acts
and
consequent
accretion
of
karma
over
many
lifetimes
.

^([9])
According
to
Adi
Shankara
in
his
Vivekachudamani
morally
right
action
(characterised
as
humbly
and
compassionately
performing
the
primary
duty
of
good
to
others
without
expectation
of
material
or
spiritual
reward)
,
helps
"purify
the
heart"
and
provide
mental
tranquility
but
it
alone
does
not
give
us
"direct
perception
of
the
Reality"
.

^([10])
This
knowledge
requires
discrimination
between
the
eternal
and
non-eternal
and
eventually
a
realization
in
contemplation
that
the
true
self
merges
in
a
universe
of
pure
consciousness
.

^([11])

In
the
Zoroastrian
faith
,
after
death
a
soul
must
face
judgment
at
the
Bridge
of
the
Separator
;
there
,
evil
people
are
tormented
by
prior
denial
of
their
own
higher
nature
,
or
conscience
,
and
"to
all
time
will
they
be
guests
for
the
House
of
the
Lie
.

"^([12])
The
Chinese
concept
of
Ren
,
indicates
that
conscience
,
along
with
social
etiquette
and
correct
relationships
,
assist
humans
to
follow
The
Way
(Tao)
a
mode
of
life
reflecting
the
implicit
human
capacity
for
goodness
and
harmony
.

Marcus
Aurelius
bronze
fragment

:
"To
move
from
one
unselfish
action
to
another
with
God
in

.


Only
there
,
delight
and
stillness
.

"

Conscience
also
features
prominently
in
Buddhism
.

^([14])
In
the
Pali
scriptures
,
for
example
,
Buddha
links
the
positive
aspect
of
conscience
to
a
pure
heart
and
a
calm
,
well-directed
mind
.


It
is
regarded
as
a
spiritual
power
,
and
one
of
the
"Guardians
of
the
World"
.


The
Buddha
also
associated
conscience
with
compassion
for
those
who
must
endure
cravings
and
suffering
in
the
world
until
right
conduct
culminates
in
right
mindfulness
and
right
contemplation
.

^([15])
Santideva
(685–763
CE)
wrote
in
the
Bodhicaryavatara
(which
he
composed
and
delivered
in
the
great
northern
Indian
Buddhist
university
of
Nalanda)
of
the
spiritual
importance
of
perfecting
virtues
such
as
generosity
,
forbearance
and
training
the
awareness
to
be
like
a
"block
of
wood"
when
attracted
by
vices
such
as
pride
or
lust
;
so
one
can
continue
advancing
towards
right
understanding
in
meditative
absorption
.

^([16])
Conscience
thus
manifests
in
Buddhism
as
unselfish
love
for
all
living
beings
which
gradually
intensifies
and
awakens
to
a
purer
awareness^([17])
where
the
mind
withdraws
from
sensory
interests
and
becomes
aware
of
itself
as
a
single
whole
.

^([18])

The
Roman
Emperor
Marcus
Aurelius
wrote
in
his
Meditations
that
conscience
was
the
human
capacity
to
live
by
rational
principles
that
were
congruent
with
the
true
,
tranquil
and
harmonious
nature
of
our
mind
and
thereby
that
of
the
Universe
:
"To
move
from
one
unselfish
action
to
another
with
God
in
mind
.


Only
there
,
delight
and
stillness 
.


.


.


the
only
rewards
of
our
existence
here
are
an
unstained
character
and
unselfish
acts
.

The
Islamic
concept
of
Taqwa
is
closely
related
to
conscience
.


In
the
Qur’ān
verses
2
:197
&
22
:37
Taqwa
refers
to
"right
conduct"
or
"piety"
,
"guarding
of
oneself"
or
"guarding
against
evil"
.

^([20])
Qur’ān
verse
47
:17
says
that
God
is
the
ultimate
source
of
the
believer
'
s
taqwā
which
is
not
simply
the
product
of
individual
will
but
requires
inspiration
from
God
.

^([21])
In
Qur’ān
verses
91
:7–8
,
God
the
Almighty
talks
about
how
He
has
perfected
the
soul
,
the
conscience
and
has
taught
it
the
wrong
(fujūr)
and
right
(taqwā)
.


Hence
,
the
awareness
of
vice
and
virtue
is
inherent
in
the
soul
,
allowing
it
to
be
tested
fairly
in
the
life
of
this
world
and
tried
,
held
accountable
on
the
day
of
judgment
for
responsibilities
to
God
and
all
humans
.

verse

states
:
"O
humankind

We
have
created
you
out
of

"
In
Islam
,
according
to
eminent
theologians
such
as
Al-Ghazali
,
although
events
are
ordained
(and
written
by
God
in
al-Lawh
al-Mahfūz
,
the
Preserved
Tablet)
,
humans
possess
free
will
to
choose
between
wrong
and
right
,
and
are
thus
responsible
for
their
actions
;
the
conscience
being
a
dynamic
personal
connection
to
God
enhanced
by
knowledge
and
practise
of
the
Five
Pillars
of
Islam
,
deeds
of
piety
,
repentance
,
self-discipline
and
prayer
;
and
disintegrated
and
metaphorically
covered
in
blackness
through
sinful
acts

The
Awakening
Conscience
,
Holman
Hunt
,
1853

In
the
Protestant
Christian
tradition
,
Martin
Luther
insisted
in
the
Diet
of
Worms
that
his
conscience
was
captive
to
the
Word
of
God
,
and
it
was
neither
safe
nor
right
to
go
against
conscience
.


To
Luther
,
conscience
falls
within
the
ethical
,
rather
than
the
religious
,
sphere
.

^([25])
John
Calvin
saw
conscience
as
a
battleground
:
"the
enemies
who
rise
up
in
our
conscience
against
his
Kingdom
and
hinder
his
decrees
prove
that
God
'
s
throne
is
not
firmly
established
therein"
.

^([26])
Many
Christians
regard
following
one
'
s
conscience
as
important
as
,
or
even
more
important
than
,
obeying
human
authority
.

^([27])
According
to
the
bible
,
written
in
Romans
2
:15
,
conscience
is
the
one
bearing
witness
,
accusing
or
excusing
one
another
,
so
we
would
know
when
we
break
the
law
written
in
our
hearts
;
the
guilt
we
feel
when
we
do
something
wrong
tells
us
that
we
need
to
repent
.

"^([28])
This
can
sometimes
(as
with
the
conflict
between
William
Tyndale
and
Thomas
More
over
the
translation
of
the
Bible
into
English)
lead
to
moral
quandaries
:
"Do
I
unreservedly
obey
my
Church/priest/military/political
leader
or
do
I
follow
my
own
inner
feeling
of
right
and
wrong
as
instructed
by
prayer
and
a
personal
reading
of
scripture
?

"^([29])
Some
contemporary
Christian
churches
and
religious
groups
hold
the
moral
teachings
of
the
Ten
Commandments
or
of
Jesus
as
the
highest
authority
in
any
situation
,
regardless
of
the
extent
to
which
it
involves
responsibilities
in
law
.

^([30])
In
the
Gospel
of
John
(7
:53–8
:11)
(King
James
Version)
Jesus
challenges
those
accusing
a
woman
of
adultery
stating
:
"
'
He
that
is
without
sin
among
you
,
let
him
first
cast
a
stone
at
her
.


'

And
again
he
stooped
down
,
and
wrote
on
the
ground
.


And
they
which
heard
it
,
being
convicted
by
their
own
conscience
,
went
out
one
by
one"
[However
the
word

'
conscience
'

is
not
in
the
original
New
Testament
Greek
,
and
is
not
in
the
vast
majority
of
Bible
versions
.

]
(see
Jesus
and
the
woman
taken
in
adultery)
.


In
the
Gospel
of
Luke
(10
:
25–37)
Jesus
tells
the
story
of
how
a
despised
and
heretical
Samaritan
(see
Parable
of
the
Good
Samaritan)
who
(out
of
compassion/pity
-
the
word

'
conscience
'

is
not
used)
helps
an
injured
stranger
beside
a
road
,
qualifies
better
for
eternal
life
by
loving
his
neighbor
,
than
a
priest
who
passes
by
on
the
other
side
.

of
the
dead
Polynices
(1865)
,

,

Gallery
of
Greece-Alexandros

Museum

This
dilemma
of
obedience
in
conscience
to
divine
or
state
law
,
was
demonstrated
dramatically
in
Antigone
'
s
defiance
of
King
Creon
'
s
order
against
burying
her
brother
an
alleged
traitor
,
appealing
to
the
"unwritten
law"
and
to
a
"longer
allegiance
to
the
dead
than
to
the
living"
.

^([32])

Catholic
theology
sees
conscience
as
the
last
practical
"judgment
of
reason
which
at
the
appropriate
moment
enjoins
[a
person]
to
do
good
and
to
avoid
evil"
.

^([33])
The
Second
Vatican
Council
(1962–65)
describes
:
"Deep
within
his
conscience
man
discovers
a
law
which
he
has
not
laid
upon
himself
but
which
he
must
obey
.


Its
voice
,
ever
calling
him
to
love
and
to
do
what
is
good
and
to
avoid
evil
,
tells
him
inwardly
at
the
right
movement
:
do
this
,
shun
that
.


For
man
has
in
his
heart
a
law
inscribed
by
God
.


His
dignity
lies
in
observing
this
law
,
and
by
it
he
will
be
judged
.


His
conscience
is
man’s
most
secret
core
,
and
his
sanctuary
.


There
he
is
alone
with
God
whose
voice
echoes
in
his
depths
.

"^([34])
Thus
,
conscience
is
not
like
the
will
,
nor
a
habit
like
prudence
,
but
"the
interior
space
in
which
we
can
listen
to
and
hear
the
truth
,
the
good
,
the
voice
of
God
.


It
is
the
inner
place
of
our
relationship
with
Him
,
who
speaks
to
our
heart
and
helps
us
to
discern
,
to
understand
the
path
we
ought
to
take
,
and
once
the
decision
is
made
,
to
move
forward
,
to
remain
faithful"^([35])
In
terms
of
logic
,
conscience
can
be
viewed
as
the
practical
conclusion
of
a
moral
syllogism
whose
major
premise
is
an
objective
norm
and
whose
minor
premise
is
a
particular
case
or
situation
to
which
the
norm
is
applied
.


Thus
,
Catholics
are
taught
to
carefully
educate
themselves
as
to
revealed
norms
and
norms
derived
therefrom
,
so
as
to
form
a
correct
conscience
.


Catholics
are
also
to
examine
their
conscience
daily
and
with
special
care
before
confession
.


Catholic
teaching
holds
that
,
"Man
has
the
right
to
act
according
to
his
conscience
and
in
freedom
so
as
personally
to
make
moral
decisions
.


He
must
not
be
forced
to
act
contrary
to
his
conscience
.


Nor
must
he
be
prevented
from
acting
according
to
his
conscience
,
especially
in
religious
matters"
.

^([36])
This
right
of
conscience
does
not
allow
one
to
arbitrarily
disagree
with
Church
teaching
and
claim
that
one
is
acting
in
accordance
with
conscience
.


A
sincere
conscience
presumes
one
is
diligently
seeking
moral
truth
from
authentic
sources
,
that
is
,
seeking
to
conform
oneself
to
that
moral
truth
by
listening
to
the
authority
established
by
Christ
to
teach
it
.


Nevertheless
,
despite
one
'
s
best
effort
,
"[i]t
can
happen
that
moral
conscience
remains
in
ignorance
and
makes
erroneous
judgments
about
acts
to
be
performed
or
already
committed 
.


.


.


This
ignorance
can
often
be
imputed
to
personal
responsibility 
.


.


.


In
such
cases
,
the
person
is
culpable
for
the
wrong
he
commits
.

"^([37])
Thus
,
if
one
realizes
one
may
have
made
a
mistaken
judgment
,
one
'
s
conscience
is
said
to
be
vincibly
erroneous
and
it
is
not
a
valid
norm
for
action
.


One
must
first
remove
the
source
of
error
and
do
one
'
s
best
to
achieve
a
correct
judgment
.


If
,
however
,
one
is
not
aware
of
one
'
s
error
or
if
,
despite
an
honest
and
diligent
effort
one
cannot
remove
the
error
by
study
or
seeking
advice
,
then
one
'
s
conscience
may
be
said
to
be
invincibly
erroneous
.


It
binds
since
one
has
subjective
certainty
that
one
is
correct
.


The
act
resulting
from
acting
on
the
invincibly
erroneous
conscience
is
not
good
in
itself
,
yet
this
deformed
act
or
material
sin
against
God
'
s
right
order
and
the
objective
norm
is
not
imputed
to
the
person
.


The
formal
obedience
given
to
such
a
judgment
of
conscience
is
good
.


Some
Catholics
appeal
to
conscience
in
order
to
justify
dissent
,
not
on
the
level
of
conscience
properly
understood
,
but
on
the
level
of
the
principles
and
norms
which
are
supposed
to
inform
conscience
.


For
example
,
some
priests
make
on
the
use
of
the
so-called
internal
forum
solution
(which
is
not
sanctioned
by
the
Magisterium)
to
justify
actions
or
lifestyles
incompatible
with
Church
teaching
,
such
as
Christ
'
s
prohibition
of
remarriage
after
divorce
or
sexual
activity
outside
marriage
.

be
at

An
example
of
someone
following
his
conscience
to
the
point
of
accepting
the
consequence
of
being
condemned
to
death
is
Sir
Thomas
More
(1478-1535)

A

the
distinction
between
the

'
sense
of
duty
'

and
the

'
moral
sense

,
as
two
aspects
of
conscience
,
and
who
saw
the
former
as
some
feeling
that
can
only
be
explained
by
a
divine
Lawgiver
,
was
John
Henry
Cardinal

^([40])
A
well
known
saying
of
him
is
that
he
would
first
toast

only
then

since
his

Judaism
arguably
does
not
require
uncompromising
obedience
to
religious
authority
;
the
case
has
been
made
that
throughout
Jewish
history
,
rabbis
have
circumvented
laws
they
found
unconscionable
,
such
as
capital
punishment
.

^([42])
Similarly
,
although
an
occupation
with
national
destiny
has
been
central
to
the
Jewish
faith
(see
Zionism)
many
scholars
(including
Moses
Mendelssohn)
stated
that
conscience
as
a
personal
revelation
of
scriptural
truth
was
an
important
adjunct
to
the
Talmudic
tradition
.

^([43][44])
The
concept
of
inner
light
in
the
Religious
Society
of
Friends
or
Quakers
is
associated
with
conscience
.

^([3])
Freemasonry
describes
itself
as
providing
an
adjunct
to
religion
and
key
symbols
found
in
a
Freemason
Lodge
are
the
square
and
compasses
explained
as
providing
lessons
that
Masons
should
"square
their

the
square
of
conscience"
,
learn
to
"circumscribe
their
desires
and
keep
their
passions
within
due
bounds
toward
all
mankind
.

"^([45])
The
historian
Manning
Clark
viewed
conscience
as
one
of
the
comforters
that
religion
placed
between
man
and
death
but
also
a
crucial
part
of
the
quest
for
grace
encouraged
by
the
Book
of
Job
and
the
Book
of
Ecclesiastes
,
leading
us
to
be
paradoxically
closest
to
the
truth
when
we
suspect
that
what
matters
most
in
life
("being
there
when
everyone
suddenly
understands
what
it
has
all
been
for")
can
never
happen
.

^([46])
Leo
Tolstoy
,
after
a
decade
studying
the
issue
(1877–1887)
,
held
that
the
only
power
capable
of
resisting
the
evil
associated
with
materialism
and
the
drive
for
social
power
of
religious
institutions
,
was
the
capacity
of
humans
to
reach
an
individual
spiritual
truth
through
reason
and
conscience
.

Charles
Darwin
thought
that
any
animal
endowed
with
well-marked
social
instincts
would
inevitably
acquire
a
moral
sense
or
conscience
,
as
its
intellectual
powers
approximated
man
'
s
.



The
secular
approach
to
conscience
includes
psychological
,
physiological
,
sociological
,
humanitarian
,
and
authoritarian
views
.

^([53])
Lawrence
Kohlberg
considered
critical
conscience
to
be
an
important
psychological
stage
in
the
proper
moral
development
of
humans
,
associated
with
the
capacity
to
rationally
weigh
principles
of
responsibility
,
being
best
encouraged
in
the
very
young
by
linkage
with
humorous
personifications
(such
as
Jiminy
Cricket)
and
later
in
adolescents
by
debates
about
individually
pertinent
moral
dilemmas
.

^([54])
Erik
Erikson
placed
the
development
of
conscience
in
the

'
pre-schooler
'

phase
of
his
eight
stages
of
normal
human
personality
development
.

^([55])
The
psychologist
Martha
Stout
terms
conscience
"an
intervening
sense
of
obligation
based
in
our
emotional
attachments
.

"^([56])
Thus
a
good
conscience
is
associated
with
feelings
of
integrity
,
psychological
wholeness
and
peacefulness
and
is
often
described
using
adjectives
such
as
"quiet"
,
"clear"
and
"easy"
.

^([57])

Sigmund
Freud
regarded
conscience
as
originating
psychologically
from
the
growth
of
civilisation
,
which
periodically
frustrated
the
external
expression
of
aggression
:
this
destructive
impulse
being
forced
to
seek
an
alternative
,
healthy
outlet
,
directed
its
energy
as
a
superego
against
the
person
'
s
own
"ego"
or
selfishness
(often
taking
its
cue
in
this
regard
from
parents
during
childhood)
.

^([58])
According
to
Freud
,
the
consequence
of
not
obeying
our
conscience
is
guilt
,
which
can
be
a
factor
in
the
development
of
neurosis
;
Freud
claimed
that
both
the
cultural
and
individual
super-ego
set
up
strict
ideal
demands
with
regard
to
the
moral
aspects
of
certain
decisions
,
disobedience
to
which
provokes
a

'
fear
of
conscience
'

.

^([59])

Antonio
Damasio
considers
conscience
an
aspect
of
extended
consciousness
beyond
survival-related
dispositions
and
incorporating
the
search
for
truth
and
desire
to
build
norms
and
ideals
for
behavior
.

Conscience
as
a
society-forming
instinct

[edit]

[]

Jeremy
Bentham
:
"Fanaticism
never
sleeps 
.


.


.


it
is
never
stopped
by
conscience
;
for
it
has
pressed
conscience
into
its
service
.

"

Michel
Glautier
argues
that
conscience
is
one
of
the
instincts
and
drives
which
enable
people
to
form
societies
:
groups
of
humans
without
these
drives
or
in
whom
they
are
insufficient
cannot
form
societies
and
do
not
reproduce
their
kind
as
successfully
as
those
that
do
.

^([61])

War
criminal
Adolf
Eichmann
in
passport
used
to
enter
Argentina
:
his
conscience
spoke
with
the
"respectable
voice"
of
the
indoctrinated
wartime
German
society
that
surrounded
him
.



Charles
Darwin
considered
that
conscience
evolved
in
humans
to
resolve
conflicts
between
competing
natural
impulses-some
about
self-preservation
but
others
about
safety
of
a
family
or
community
;
the
claim
of
conscience
to
moral
authority
emerged
from
the
"greater
duration
of
impression
of
social
instincts"
in
the
struggle
for
survival
.

^([62])
In
such
a
view
,
behavior
destructive
to
a
person
'
s
society
(either
to
its
structures
or
to
the
persons
it
comprises)
is
bad
or
"evil"
.

^([63])
Thus
,
conscience
can
be
viewed
as
an
outcome
of
those
biological
drives
that
prompt
humans
to
avoid
provoking
fear
or
contempt
in
others
;
being
experienced
as
guilt
and
shame
in
differing
ways
from
society
to
society
and
person
to
person
.

^([64])
A
requirement
of
conscience
in
this
view
is
the
capacity
to
see
ourselves
from
the
point
of
view
of
another
person
.

^([65])
Persons
unable
to
do
this
(psychopaths
,
sociopaths
,
narcissists)
therefore
often
act
in
ways
which
are
"evil"
.

^([66])

Fundamental
in
this
view
of
conscience
is
that
humans
consider
some
"other"
as
being
in
a
social
relationship
.


Thus
,
nationalism
is
invoked
in
conscience
to
quell
tribal
conflict
and
the
notion
of
a
Brotherhood
of
Man
is
invoked
to
quell
national
conflicts
.


Yet
such
crowd
drives
may
not
only
overwhelm
but
redefine
individual
conscience
.


Friedrich
Nietzsche
stated
:
"communal
solidarity
is
annihilated
by
the
highest
and
strongest
drives
that
,
when
they
break
out
passionately
,
whip
the
individual
far
past
the
average
low
level
of
the

'
herd-conscience
.


'
"^([67])
Jeremy
Bentham
noted
that
:
"fanaticism
never
sleeps 
.


.


.


it
is
never
stopped
by
conscience
;
for
it
has
pressed
conscience
into
its
service
.

"^([68])
Hannah
Arendt
in
her
study
of
the
trial
of
Adolf
Eichmann
in
Jerusalem
,
notes
that
the
accused
,
as
with
almost
all
his
fellow
Germans
,
had
lost
track
of
his
conscience
to
the
point
where
they
hardly
remembered
it
;
this
wasn
'
t
caused
by
familiarity
with
atrocities
or
by
psychologically
redirecting
any
resultant
natural
pity
to
themselves
for
having
to
bear
such
an
unpleasant
duty
,
so
much
as
by
the
fact
that
anyone
whose
conscience
did
develop
doubts
could
see
no
one
who
shared
them
:
"Eichmann
did
not
need
to
close
his
ears
to
the
voice
of
conscience 
.


.


.


not
because
he
had
none
,
but
because
his
conscience
spoke
with
a
"respectable
voice"
,
with
the
voice
of
the
respectable
society
around
him"
.

^([69])

Sir
Arthur
Keith
in
1948
developed
the
Amity-enmity
complex
.


We
evolved
as
tribal
groups
surrounded
by
enemies
;
thus
conscience
evolved
a
dual
role
;
the
duty
to
save
and
protect
members
of
the
in-group
,
and
the
duty
to
show
hatred
and
aggression
towards
any
out-group
.



An
interesting
area
of
research
in
this
context
concerns
the
similarities
between
our
relationships
and
those
of
animals
,
whether
animals
in
human
society
(pets
,
working
animals
,
even
animals
grown
for
food)
or
in
the
wild
.

^([70])
One
idea
is
that
as
people
or
animals
perceive
a
social
relationship
as
important
to
preserve
,
their
conscience
begins
to
respect
that
former
"other"
,
and
urge
actions
that
protect
it
.

^([71][72])
Similarly
,
in
complex
territorial
and
cooperative
breeding
bird
communities
(such
as
the
Australian
magpie)
that
have
a
high
degree
of
etiquettes
,
rules
,
hierarchies
,
play
,
songs
and
negotiations
,
rule-breaking
seems
tolerated
on
occasions
not
obviously
related
to
survival
of
the
individual
or
group
;
behaviour
often
appearing
to
exhibit
a
touching
gentleness
and
tenderness
.

^([73])

Evolutionary
biology

[edit]

Contemporary
scientists
in
evolutionary
biology
seek
to
explain
conscience
as
a
function
of
the
brain
that
evolved
to
facilitate
altruism
within
societies
.

^([74])
In
his
book
The
God
Delusion
,
Richard
Dawkins
states
that
he
agrees
with
Robert
Hinde
'
s
Why
Good
is
Good
,
Michael
Shermer
'
s
The
Science
of
Good
and
Evil
,
Robert
Buckman
'
s
Can
We
Be
Good
Without
God
?


and
Marc
Hauser
'
s
Moral
Minds
,
that
our
sense
of
right
and
wrong
can
be
derived
from
our
Darwinian
past
.


He
subsequently
reinforced
this
idea
through
the
lens
of
the
gene-centered
view
of
evolution
,
since
the
unit
of
natural
selection
is
neither
an
individual
organism
nor
a
group
,
but
rather
the
"selfish"
gene
,
and
these
genes
could
ensure
their
own
"selfish"
survival
by
,
inter
alia
,
pushing
individuals
to
act
altruistically
towards
its
kin
.

Neuroscience
and
artificial
conscience

[edit]

Numerous
case
studies
of
brain
damage
have
shown
that
damage
to
areas
of
the
brain
(such
as
the
anterior
prefrontal
cortex)
results
in
the
reduction
or
elimination
of
inhibitions
,
with
a
corresponding
radical
change
in
behaviour
.

^([76])
When
the
damage
occurs
to
adults
,
they
may
still
be
able
to
perform
moral
reasoning
;
but
when
it
occurs
to
children
,
they
may
never
develop
that
ability
.

^([77][78])

Attempts
have
been
made
by
neuroscientists
to
locate
the
free
will
necessary
for
what
is
termed
the

'
veto
'

of
conscience
over
unconscious
mental
processes
(see
Neuroscience
of
free
will
and
Benjamin
Libet)
in
a
scientifically
measurable
awareness
of
an
intention
to
carry
out
an
act
occurring
350–400
microseconds
after
the
electrical
discharge
known
as
the

'
readiness
potential
.


'
^([79][80][81])

Jacques
Pitrat
claims
that
some
kind
of
artificial
conscience
is
beneficial
in
artificial
intelligence
systems
to
improve
their
long-term
performance
and
direct
their
introspective
processing
.

The
word
"conscience"
derives
etymologically
from
the
Latin
conscientia
,
meaning
"privity
of
knowledge"^([83])
or
"with-knowledge"
.


The
English
word
implies
internal
awareness
of
a
moral
standard
in
the
mind
concerning
the
quality
of
one
'
s
motives
,
as
well
as
a
consciousness
of
our
own
actions
.

^([84])
Thus
conscience
considered
philosophically
may
be
first
,
and
perhaps
most
commonly
,
a
largely
unexamined
"gut
feeling"
or
"vague
sense
of
guilt"
about
what
ought
to
be
or
should
have
been
done
.

^([85])
Conscience
in
this
sense
is
not
necessarily
the
product
of
a
process
of
rational
consideration
of
the
moral
features
of
a
situation
(or
the
applicable
normative
principles
,
rules
or
laws)
and
can
arise
from
parental
,
peer
group
,
religious
,
state
or
corporate
indoctrination
,
which
may
or
may
not
be
presently
consciously
acceptable
to
the
person
("traditional
conscience")
.

^([86])
Conscience
may
be
defined
as
the
practical
reason
employed
when
applying
moral
convictions
to
a
situation
("critical
conscience")
.

^([87])
In
purportedly
morally
mature
mystical
people
who
have
developed
this
capacity
through
daily
contemplation
or
meditation
combined
with
selfless
service
to
others
,
critical
conscience
can
be
aided
by
a
"spark"
of
intuitive
insight
or
revelation
(called
marifa
in
Islamic
Sufi
philosophy
and
synderesis
in
medieval
Christian
scholastic
moral
philosophy)
.

^([88][89])
Conscience
is
accompanied
in
each
case
by
an
internal
awareness
of

'
inner
light
'

and
approbation
or

'
inner
darkness
'

and
condemnation
as
well
as
a
resulting
conviction
of
right

duty
either
followed
or
declined
.

Medieval

[edit]

The
medieval
Islamic
scholar
and
mystic
Al-Ghazali
divided
the
concept
of
Nafs
(soul
or
self
(spirituality))
into
three
categories^([48])
based
on
the
Qur’an
:

1
.


Nafs
Ammarah
(12
:53)
which
"exhorts
one
to
freely
indulge
in

gratifying
passions
and
instigates
to
do
evil"
2
.


Nafs
Lawammah
(75
:2)
which
is
"the
conscience
that
directs
man

towards
right
or
wrong"
3
.


Nafs
Mutmainnah
(89
:27)
which
is
"a
self
that
reaches
the
ultimate

peace"

The
medieval
Persian
philosopher
and
physician
Muhammad
ibn
Zakariya
al-Razi
believed
in
a
close
relationship
between
conscience
or
spiritual
integrity
and
physical
health
;
rather
than
being
self-indulgent
,
man
should
pursue
knowledge
,
use
his
intellect
and
apply
justice
in
his
life
.

^([91])
The
medieval
Islamic
philosopher
Avicenna

[]

The
Flemish
mystic
Jan
van
Ruysbroeck
viewed
a
pure
conscience
as
facilitating
"an
outflowing
losing
of
oneself
in
the
abyss
of
that
eternal
object
which
is
the
highest
and
chief
blessedness"
.



Some
medieval
Christian
scholastics
such
as
Bonaventure
made
a
distinction
between
conscience
as
a
rational
faculty
of
the
mind
(practical
reason)
and
inner
awareness
,
an
intuitive
"spark"
to
do
good
,
called
synderesis
arising
from
a
remnant
appreciation
of
absolute
good
and
when
consciously
denied
(for
example
to
perform
an
evil
act)
,
becoming
a
source
of
inner
torment
.

^([89])
Early
modern
theologians
such
as
William
Perkins
and
William
Ames
developed
a
syllogistic
understanding
of
the
conscience
,
where
God
'
s
law
made
the
first
term
,
the
act
to
be
judged
the
second
and
the
action
of
the
conscience
(as
a
rational
faculty)
produced
the
judgement
.


By
debating
test
cases
applying
such
understanding
conscience
was
trained
and
refined
(i

.

^([93])

[]

The
medieval
Persian
philosopher
Ibn
Sina
(Avicenna)
developed
a
sensory
deprivation
thought
experiment
to
explore
the
relationship
between
conscience
and
God
.



In
the
13th
century
,
St
.


Thomas
Aquinas
regarded
conscience
as
the
application
of
moral
knowledge
to
a
particular
case
(S
.

T
.


I
,
q
.


79
,
a
.

.


Thus
,
conscience
was
considered
an
act
or
judgment
of
practical
reason
that
began
with
synderesis
,
the
structured
development
of
our
innate
remnant
awareness
of
absolute
good
(which
he
categorised
as
involving
the
five
primary
precepts
proposed
in
his
theory
of
Natural
Law)
into
an
acquired
habit
of
applying
moral
principles
.

^([50])
According
to
Singer
,
Aquinas
held
that
conscience
,
or
conscientia
was
an
imperfect
process
of
judgment
applied
to
activity
because
knowledge
of
the
natural
law
(and
all
acts
of
natural
virtue
implicit
therein)
was
obscured
in
most
people
by
education
and
custom
that
promoted
selfishness
rather
than
fellow-feeling
(Summa
Theologiae
,
I–II
,
I)
.

^([94])
Aquinas
also
discussed
conscience
in
relation
to
the
virtue
of
prudence
to
explain
why
some
people
appear
to
be
less
"morally
enlightened"
than
others
,
their
weak
will
being
incapable
of
adequately
balancing
their
own
needs
with
those
of
others
.

^([95])

Aquinas
reasoned
that
acting
contrary
to
conscience
is
an
evil
action
but
an
errant
conscience
is
only
blameworthy
if
it
is
the
result
of
culpable
or
vincible
ignorance
of
factors
that
one
has
a
duty
to
have
knowledge
of
.

^([94])
Aquinas
also
argued
that
conscience
should
be
educated
to
act
towards
real
goods
(from
God)
which
encouraged
human
flourishing
,
rather
than
the
apparent
goods
of
sensory
pleasures
.

^([94])
In
his
Commentary
on
Aristotle
'
s
Nicomachean
Ethics
Aquinas
claimed
it
was
weak
will
that
allowed
a
non-virtuous
man
to
choose
a
principle
allowing
pleasure
ahead
of
one
requiring
moral
constraint
.

^([96])

Thomas
A
Kempis
in
the
medieval
contemplative
classic
The
Imitation
of
Christ
(ca
1418)
stated
that
the
glory
of
a
good
man
is
the
witness
of
a
good
conscience
.


"Preserve
a
quiet
conscience
and
you
will
always
have
joy
.


A
quiet
conscience
can
endure
much
,
and
remains
joyful
in
all
trouble
,
but
an
evil
conscience
is
always
fearful
and
uneasy
.

"^([97])
The
anonymous
medieval
author
of
the
Christian
mystical
work
The
Cloud
of
Unknowing
similarly
expressed
the
view
that
in
profound
and
prolonged
contemplation
a
soul
dries
up
the
"root
and
ground"
of
the
sin
that
is
always
there
,
even
after
one
'
s
confession
and
however
busy
one
is
in
holy
things
:
"therefore
,
whoever
would
work
at
becoming
a
contemplative
must
first
cleanse
his
[or
her]
conscience
.

"^([98])
The
medieval
Flemish
mystic
John
of
Ruysbroeck
likewise
held
that
true
conscience
has
four
aspects
that
are
necessary
to
render
a
man
just
in
the
active
and
contemplative
life
:
"a
free
spirit
,
attracting
itself
through
love"
;
"an
intellect
enlightened
by
grace"
,
"a
delight
yielding
propension
or
inclination"
and
"an
outflowing
losing
of
oneself
in
the
abyss
of 
.


.


.


that
eternal
object
which
is
the
highest
and
chief
blessedness 
.


.


.


those
lofty
amongst
men
,
are
absorbed
in
it
,
and
immersed
in
a
certain
boundless
thing
.

"^([99])

Modern

[edit]

[]

Schopenhauer
considered
that
the
good
conscience
we
experience
after
an
unselfish
act
verifies
that
our
true
self
exists
outside
our
physical
person
.



[]

Benedict
de
Spinoza
:
moral
problems
and
our
emotional
responses
to
them
should
be
reasoned
from
the
perspective
of
eternity
.



[]

Immanuel
Kant
:
the
moral
law
within
us
has
true
infinity
.



Benedict
de
Spinoza
in
his
Ethics
,
published
after
his
death
in
1677
,
argued
that
most
people
,
even
those
that
consider
themselves
to
exercise
free
will
,
make
moral
decisions
on
the
basis
of
imperfect
sensory
information
,
inadequate
understanding
of
their
mind
and
will
,
as
well
as
emotions
which
are
both
outcomes
of
their
contingent
physical
existence
and
forms
of
thought
defective
from
being
chiefly
impelled
by
self-preservation
.

^([100])
The
solution
,
according
to
Spinoza
,
was
to
gradually
increase
the
capacity
of
our
reason
to
change
the
forms
of
thought
produced
by
emotions
and
to
fall
in
love
with
viewing
problems
requiring
moral
decision
from
the
perspective
of
eternity
.

^([101])
Thus
,
living
a
life
of
peaceful
conscience
means
to
Spinoza
that
reason
is
used
to
generate
adequate
ideas
where
the
mind
increasingly
sees
the
world
and
its
conflicts
,
our
desires
and
passions
sub
specie
aeternitatis
,
that
is
without
reference
to
time
.

^([102])
Hegel
'
s
obscure
and
mystical
Philosophy
of
Mind
held
that
the
absolute
right
of
freedom
of
conscience
facilitates
human
understanding
of
an
all-embracing
unity
,
an
absolute
which
was
rational
,
real
and
true
.

^([103])
Nevertheless
,
Hegel
thought
that
a
functioning
State
would
always
be
tempted
not
to
recognize
conscience
in
its
form
of
subjective
knowledge
,
just
as
similar
non-objective
opinions
are
generally
rejected
in
science
.

^([104])
A
similar
idealist
notion
was
expressed
in
the
writings
of
Joseph
Butler
who
argued
that
conscience
is
God-given
,
should
always
be
obeyed
,
is
intuitive
,
and
should
be
considered
the
"constitutional
monarch"
and
the
"universal
moral
faculty"
:
"conscience
does
not
only
offer
itself
to
show
us
the
way
we
should
walk
in
,
but
it
likewise
carries
its
own
authority
with
it
.

"^([105])
Butler
advanced
ethical
speculation
by
referring
to
a
duality
of
regulative
principles
in
human
nature
:
first
,
"self-love"
(seeking
individual
happiness)
and
second
,
"benevolence"
(compassion
and
seeking
good
for
another)
in
conscience
(also
linked
to
the
agape
of
situational
ethics)
.

^([51])
Conscience
tended
to
be
more
authoritative
in
questions
of
moral
judgment
,
thought
Butler
,
because
it
was
more
likely
to
be
clear
and
certain
(whereas
calculations
of
self-interest
tended
to
probable
and
changing
conclusions)
.

^([106])
John
Selden
in
his
Table
Talk
expressed
the
view
that
an
awake
but
excessively
scrupulous
or
ill-trained
conscience
could
hinder
resolve
and
practical
action
;
it
being
"like
a
horse
that
is
not
well
wayed
,
he
starts
at
every
bird
that
flies
out
of
the
hedge"
.

^([107])

As
the
sacred
texts
of
ancient
Hindu
and
Buddhist
philosophy
became
available
in
German
translations
in
the
18th
and
19th
centuries
,
they
influenced
philosophers
such
as
Schopenhauer
to
hold
that
in
a
healthy
mind
only
deeds
oppress
our
conscience
,
not
wishes
and
thoughts
;
"for
it
is
only
our
deeds
that
hold
us
up
to
the
mirror
of
our
will"
;
the
good
conscience
,
thought
Schopenhauer
,
we
experience
after
every
disinterested
deed
arises
from
direct
recognition
of
our
own
inner
being
in
the
phenomenon
of
another
,
it
affords
us
the
verification
"that
our
true
self
exists
not
only
in
our
own
person
,
this
particular
manifestation
,
but
in
everything
that
lives
.


By
this
the
heart
feels
itself
enlarged
,
as
by
egotism
it
is
contracted
.

"^([108])

Immanuel
Kant
,
a
central
figure
of
the
Age
of
Enlightenment
,
likewise
claimed
that
two
things
filled
his
mind
with
ever
new
and
increasing
admiration
and
awe
,
the
oftener
and
more
steadily
they
were
reflected
on
:
"the
starry
heavens
above
me
and
the
moral
law
within
me 
.


.


.


the
latter
begins
from
my
invisible
self
,
my
personality
,
and
exhibits
me
in
a
world
which
has
true
infinity
but
which
I
recognise
myself
as
existing
in
a
universal
and
necessary
(and
not
only
,
as
in
the
first
case
,
contingent)
connection
.

"^([109])
The

'
universal
connection
'

referred
to
here
is
Kant
'
s
categorical
imperative
:
"act
only
according
to
that
maxim
by
which
you
can
at
the
same
time
will
that
it
should
become
a
universal
law
.

"^([110])
Kant
considered
critical
conscience
to
be
an
internal
court
in
which
our
thoughts
accuse
or
excuse
one
another
;
he
acknowledged
that
morally
mature
people
do
often
describe
contentment
or
peace
in
the
soul
after
following
conscience
to
perform
a
duty
,
but
argued
that
for
such
acts
to
produce
virtue
their
primary
motivation
should
simply
be
duty
,
not
expectation
of
any
such
bliss
.

^([111])
Rousseau
expressed
a
similar
view
that
conscience
somehow
connected
man
to
a
greater
metaphysical
unity
.


John
Plamenatz
in
his
critical
examination
of
Rousseau
'
s
work
considered
that
conscience
was
there
defined
as
the
feeling
that
urges
us
,
in
spite
of
contrary
passions
,
towards
two
harmonies
:
the
one
within
our
minds
and
between
our
passions
,
and
the
other
within
society
and
between
its
members
;
"the
weakest
can
appeal
to
it
in
the
strongest
,
and
the
appeal
,
though
often
unsuccessful
,
is
always
disturbing
.


However
,
corrupted
by
power
or
wealth
we
may
be
,
either
as
possessors
of
them
or
as
victims
,
there
is
something
in
us
serving
to
remind
us
that
this
corruption
is
against
nature
.

"^([112])

[]

John
Locke
viewed
the
widespread
social
fact
of
conscience
as
a
justification
for
natural
rights
.

Adam
Smith
:
conscience
shows
what
relates
to

[]

Samuel
Johnson
(1775)
stated
that
"No
man
'
s
conscience
can
tell
him
the
right
of
another
man
.

"

Other
philosophers
expressed
a
more
sceptical
and
pragmatic
view
of
the
operation
of
"conscience"
in
society
.

^([113])
John
Locke
in
his
Essays
on
the
Law
of
Nature
argued
that
the
widespread
fact
of
human
conscience
allowed
a
philosopher
to
infer
the
necessary
existence
of
objective
moral
laws
that
occasionally
might
contradict
those
of
the
state
.

^([114])
Locke
highlighted
the
metaethics
problem
of
whether
accepting
a
statement
like
"follow
your
conscience"
supports
subjectivist
or
objectivist
conceptions
of
conscience
as
a
guide
in
concrete
morality
,
or
as
a
spontaneous
revelation
of
eternal
and
immutable
principles
to
the
individual
:
"if
conscience
be
a
proof
of
innate
principles
,
contraries
may
be
innate
principles
;
since
some
men
with
the
same
bent
of
conscience
prosecute
what
others
avoid
.

"^([115])
Thomas
Hobbes
likewise
pragmatically
noted
that
opinions
formed
on
the
basis
of
conscience
with
full
and
honest
conviction
,
nevertheless
should
always
be
accepted
with
humility
as
potentially
erroneous
and
not
necessarily
indicating
absolute
knowledge
or
truth
.

^([116])
William
Godwin
expressed
the
view
that
conscience
was
a
memorable
consequence
of
the
"perception
by
men
of
every
creed
when
the
descend
into
the
scene
of
busy
life"
that
they
possess
free
will
.

^([117])
Adam
Smith
considered
that
it
was
only
by
developing
a
critical
conscience
that
we
can
ever
see
what
relates
to
ourselves
in
its
proper
shape
and
dimensions
;
or
that
we
can
ever
make
any
proper
comparison
between
our
own
interests
and
those
of
other
people
.

^([118])
John
Stuart
Mill
believed
that
idealism
about
the
role
of
conscience
in
government
should
be
tempered
with
a
practical
realisation
that
few
men
in
society
are
capable
of
directing
their
minds
or
purposes
towards
distant
or
unobvious
interests
,
of
disinterested
regard
for
others
,
and
especially
for
what
comes
after
them
,
for
the
idea
of
posterity
,
of
their
country
,
or
of
humanity
,
whether
grounded
on
sympathy
or
on
a
conscientious
feeling
.

^([119])
Mill
held
that
certain
amount
of
conscience
,
and
of
disinterested
public
spirit
,
may
fairly
be
calculated
on
in
the
citizens
of
any
community
ripe
for
representative
government
,
but
that
"it
would
be
ridiculous
to
expect
such
a
degree
of
it
,
combined
with
such
intellectual
discernment
,
as
would
be
proof
against
any
plausible
fallacy
tending
to
make
that
which
was
for
their
class
interest
appear
the
dictate
of
justice
and
of
the
general
good
.

"^([119])

Josiah
Royce
(1855–1916)
built
on
the
transcendental
idealism
view
of
conscience
,
viewing
it
as
the
ideal
of
life
which
constitutes
our
moral
personality
,
our
plan
of
being
ourself
,
of
making
common
sense
ethical
decisions
.


But
,
he
thought
,
this
was
only
true
insofar
as
our
conscience
also
required
loyalty
to
"a
mysterious
higher
or
deeper
self"
.

^([120])
In
the
modern
Christian
tradition
this
approach
achieved
expression
with
Dietrich
Bonhoeffer
who
stated
during
his
imprisonment
by
the
Nazis
in
World
War
II
that
conscience
for
him
was
more
than
practical
reason
,
indeed
it
came
from
a
"depth
which
lies
beyond
a
man
'
s
own
will
and
his
own
reason
and
it
makes
itself
heard
as
the
call
of
human
existence
to
unity
with
itself
.

"^([121])
For
Bonhoeffer
a
guilty
conscience
arose
as
an
indictment
of
the
loss
of
this
unity
and
as
a
warning
against
the
loss
of
one
'
s
self
;
primarily
,
he
thought
,
it
is
directed
not
towards
a
particular
kind
of
doing
but
towards
a
particular
mode
of
being
.


It
protests
against
a
doing
which
imperils
the
unity
of
this
being
with
itself
.

^([52])
Conscience
for
Bonhoeffer
did
not
,
like
shame
,
embrace
or
pass
judgment
on
the
morality
of
the
whole
of
its
owner
'
s
life
;
it
reacted
only
to
certain
definite
actions
:
"it
recalls
what
is
long
past
and
represents
this
disunion
as
something
which
is
already
accomplished
and
irreparable"
.

^([122])
The
man
with
a
conscience
,
he
believed
,
fights
a
lonely
battle
against
the
"overwhelming
forces
of
inescapable
situations"
which
demand
moral
decisions
despite
the
likelihood
of
adverse
consequences
.

^([122])
Simon
Soloveychik
has
similarly
claimed
that
the
truth
distributed
in
the
world
,
as
the
statement
about
human
dignity
,
as
the
affirmation
of
the
line
between
good
and
evil
,
lives
in
people
as
conscience
.

Dietrich
Bonhoeffer
(1932)

As
Hannah
Arendt
pointed
out
,
however
,
(following
the
utilitarian
John
Stuart
Mill
on
this

a
bad

does
not

signify

in

only
those
who
affirm
a

Representing
our
soul
or
true
self
by
analogy
as
our
house
,
Arendt
wrote
that
"conscience
is
the
anticipation
of
the
fellow
who
awaits
you
if
and
when
you
come
home
.

"^([126])
Arendt
believed
that
people
who
are
unfamiliar
with
the
process
of
silent
critical
reflection
about
what
they
say
and
do
will
not
mind
contradicting
themselves
by
an
immoral
act
or
crime
,
since
they
can
"count
on
its
being
forgotten
the
next
moment
;"
bad
people
are
not
full
of
regrets
.

^([126])
Arendt
also
wrote
eloquently
on
the
problem
of
languages
distinguishing
the
word
consciousness
from
conscience
.


One
reason
,
she
held
,
was
that
conscience
,
as
we
understand
it
in
moral
or
legal
matters
,
is
supposedly
always
present
within
us
,
just
like
consciousness
:
"and
this
conscience
is
also
supposed
to
tell
us
what
to
do
and
what
to
repent
;
before
it
became
the
lumen
naturale
or
Kant
'
s
practical
reason
,
it
was
the
voice
of
God
.

Albert
Einstein
associated
conscience
with
suprapersonal
thoughts
,
feelings
and
aspirations
.



Albert
Einstein
,
as
a
self-professed
adherent
of
humanism
and
rationalism
,
likewise
viewed
an
enlightened
religious
person
as
one
whose
conscience
reflects
that
he
"has
,
to
the
best
of
his
ability
,
liberated
himself
from
the
fetters
of
his
selfish
desires
and
is
preoccupied
with
thoughts
,
feelings
and
aspirations
to
which
he
clings
because
of
their
super-personal
value
.

"^([128])
Einstein
often
referred
to
the
"inner
voice"
as
a
source
of
both
moral
and
physical
knowledge
:
"Quantum
mechanics
is
very
impressive
.


But
an
inner
voice
tells
me
that
it
is
not
the
real
thing
.


The
theory
produces
a
good
deal
but
hardly
brings
one
closer
to
the
secrets
of
the
Old
One
.

am
at
all

convinced
that
He

"^([129])

Simone
Weil
who
fought
for
the
French
resistance
(the
Maquis)
argued
in
her
final
book
The
Need
for
Roots
:
Prelude
to
a
Declaration
of
Duties
Towards
Mankind
that
for
society
to
become
more
just
and
protective
of
liberty
,
obligations
should
take
precedence
over
rights
in
moral
and
political
philosophy
and
a
spiritual
awakening
should
occur
in
the
conscience
of
most
citizens
,
so
that
social
obligations
are
viewed
as
fundamentally
having
a
transcendent
origin
and
a
beneficent
impact
on
human
character
when
fulfilled
.

^([130][131])
Simone
Weil
also
in
that
work
provided
a
psychological
explanation
for
the
mental
peace
associated
with
a
good
conscience
:
"the
liberty
of
men
of
goodwill
,
though
limited
in
the
sphere
of
action
,
is
complete
in
that
of
conscience
.


For
,
having
incorporated
the
rules
into
their
own
being
,
the
prohibited
possibilities
no
longer
present
themselves
to
the
mind
,
and
have
not
to
be
rejected
.

"^([132])

Alternatives
to
such
metaphysical
and
idealist
opinions
about
conscience
arose
from
realist
and
materialist
perspectives
such
as
those
of
Charles
Darwin
.


Darwin
suggested
that
"any
animal
whatever
,
endowed
with
well-marked
social
instincts
,
the
parental
and
filial
affections
being
here
included
,
would
inevitably
acquire
a
moral
sense
or
conscience
,
as
soon
as
its
intellectual
powers
had
become
as
well
,
or
as
nearly
as
well
developed
,
as
in
man
.

"^([133])
Émile
Durkheim
held
that
the
soul
and
conscience
were
particular
forms
of
an
impersonal
principle
diffused
in
the
relevant
group
and
communicated
by
totemic
ceremonies
.

^([134])
A

J
.


Ayer
was
a
more
recent
realist
who
held
that
the
existence
of
conscience
was
an
empirical
question
to
be
answered
by
sociological
research
into
the
moral
habits
of
a
given
person
or
group
of
people
,
and
what
causes
them
to
have
precisely
those
habits
and
feelings
.


Such
an
inquiry
,
he
believed
,
fell
wholly
within
the
scope
of
the
existing
social
sciences
.

^([135])
George
Edward
Moore
bridged
the
idealistic
and
sociological
views
of

'
critical
'

and

'
traditional
'

conscience
in
stating
that
the
idea
of
abstract

'
rightness
'

and
the
various
degrees
of
the
specific
emotion
excited
by
it
are
what
constitute
,
for
many
persons
,
the
specifically

'
moral
sentiment
'

or
conscience
.


For
others
,
however
,
an
action
seems
to
be
properly
termed

'
internally
right
'

,
merely
because
they
have
previously
regarded
it
as
right
,
the
idea
of

'
rightness
'

being
present
in
some
way
to
his
or
her
mind
,
but
not
necessarily
among
his
or
her
deliberately
constructed
motives

The
French
philosopher
Simone
de
Beauvoir
in
A
Very
Easy
Death
(Une

très
douce
,
1964)
reflects
within
her
own
conscience
about
her
mother
'
s
attempts
to
develop
such
a
moral
sympathy
and
understanding
of
others
.

^([137])


"The
sight
of
her
tears
grieved
me
;
but
I
soon
realised
that
she
was

weeping
over
her
failure
,
without
caring
about
what
was
happening

inside
me 
.


.


.


We
might
still
have
come
to
an
understanding
if
,
instead

of
asking
everybody
to
pray
for
my
soul
,
she
had
given
me
a
little

confidence
and
sympathy
.


I
know
now
what
prevented
her
from
doing
so
:

she
had
too
much
to
pay
back
,
too
many
wounds
to
salve
,
to
put
herself

in
another
'
s
place
.


In
actual
doing
she
made
every
sacrifice
,
but
her

feelings
did
not
take
her
out
of
herself
.


Besides
,
how
could
she
have

tried
to
understand
me
since
she
avoided
looking
into
her
own
heart
?



As
for
discovering
an
attitude
that
would
not
have
set
us
apart
,

nothing
in
her
life
had
ever
prepared
her
for
such
a
thing
:
the

unexpected
sent
her
into
a
panic
,
because
she
had
been
taught
never
to

think
,
act
or
feel
except
in
a
ready-made
framework
.

Michael
Walzer
claimed
that
the
growth
of
religious
toleration
in
Western
nations
arose
amongst
other
things
,
from
the
general
recognition
that
private
conscience
signified
some
inner
divine
presence
regardless
of
the
religious
faith
professed
and
from
the
general
respectability
,
piety
,
self-limitation
,
and
sectarian
discipline
which
marked
most
of
the
men
who
claimed
the
rights
of
conscience
.

^([138])
Walzer
also
argued
that
attempts
by
courts
to
define
conscience
as
a
merely
personal
moral
code
or
as
sincere
belief
,
risked
encouraging
an
anarchy
of
moral
egotisms
,
unless
such
a
code
and
motive
was
necessarily
tempered
with
shared
moral
knowledge
:
derived
either
from
the
connection
of
the
individual
to
a
universal
spiritual
order
,
or
from
the
common
principles
and
mutual
engagements
of
unselfish
people
.

^([139])
Ronald
Dworkin
maintains
that
constitutional
protection
of
freedom
of
conscience
is
central
to
democracy
but
creates
personal
duties
to
live
up
to
it
:
"Freedom
of
conscience
presupposes
a
personal
responsibility
of
reflection
,
and
it
loses
much
of
its
meaning
when
that
responsibility
is
ignored
.


A
good
life
need
not
be
an
especially
reflective
one
;
most
of
the
best
lives
are
just
lived
rather
than
studied
.


But
there
are
moments
that
cry
out
for
self-assertion
,
when
a
passive
bowing
to
fate
or
a
mechanical
decision
out
of
deference
or
convenience
is
treachery
,
because
it
forfeits
dignity
for
ease
.

"^([140])
Edward
Conze
stated
it
is
important
for
individual
and
collective
moral
growth
that
we
recognise
the
illusion
of
our
conscience
being
wholly
located
in
our
body
;
indeed
both
our
conscience
and
wisdom
expand
when
we
act
in
an
unselfish
way
and
conversely
"repressed
compassion
results
in
an
unconscious
sense
of
guilt
.

Peter
Singer
:
distinguished
between
immature
"traditional"
and
highly
reasoned
"critical"
conscience

The
philosopher
Peter
Singer
considers
that
usually
when
we
describe
an
action
as
conscientious
in
the
critical
sense
we
do
so
in
order
to
deny
either
that
the
relevant
agent
was
motivated
by
selfish
desires
,
like
greed
or
ambition
,
or
that
he
acted
on
whim
or
impulse
.

^([142])

Moral
anti-realists
debate
whether
the
moral
facts
necessary
to
activate
conscience
supervene
on
natural
facts
with
a
posteriori
necessity
;
or
arise
a
priori
because
moral
facts
have
a
primary
intension
and
naturally
identical
worlds
may
be
presumed
morally
identical
.

^([143])
It
has
also
been
argued
that
there
is
a
measure
of
moral
luck
in
how
circumstances
create
the
obstacles
which
conscience
must
overcome
to
apply
moral
principles
or
human
rights
and
that
with
the
benefit
of
enforceable
property
rights
and
the
rule
of
law
,
access
to
universal
health
care
plus
the
absence
of
high
adult
and
infant
mortality
from
conditions
such
as
malaria
,
tuberculosis
,
HIV/AIDS
and
famine
,
people
in
relatively
prosperous
developed
countries
have
been
spared
pangs
of
conscience
associated
with
the
physical
necessity
to
steal
scraps
of
food
,
bribe
tax
inspectors

police
officers
,
and
commit
murder
in
guerrilla
wars

corrupt
government
forces

^([144])
Roger
Scruton
has
claimed
that
true
understanding
of
conscience
and
its
relationship
with
morality
has
been
hampered
by
an
"impetuous"
belief
that
philosophical
questions
are
solved
through
the
analysis
of
language
in
an
area
where
clarity
threatens

interests

Susan
Sontag
similarly
argued
that
it
was
a
symptom
of
psychological
immaturity
not
to
recognise
that
many
morally
immature
people
willingly
experience
a
form
of
delight
,
in
some
an
erotic
breaking
of
taboo
,
when
witnessing
violence

suffering

Jonathan
Glover
wrote
that
most
of
us
"do

our
conscience
is
likely
shaped
not
so
much
by
heroic
struggles
,
as
by
choice
of
partner

,
as
well

Garrett
Hardin
,
in

famous
article
called
"The
Tragedy

argues
that
any
instance
in
which
society
appeals
to
an
individual
exploiting
a
commons
to
restrain
himself
or
herself
for
the
general
good—by
means
of
his
or
her
conscience—merely
sets
up
a
system
which
,
by
selectively
diverting
societal
power
and
physical
resources
to
those
lacking
in
conscience
,
while
fostering
guilt
(including
anxiety
about
his
or

individual
contribution
to
over-population)
in

actually
works

the
elimination

:
consumers
risk

John
Ralston
Saul
expressed
the
view
in
The

developed
nations
many
people
have
acquiesced
in
turning
over
their
sense

experts

willingly
restricting

moral
freedom

to
limited
consumer
actions
ruled
by
the
ideology
of
the
free
market
,
while
citizen
participation
in

is
limited

turns

Some
argue
on
religious
or
philosophical
grounds
that
it
is
blameworthy
to
act
against
conscience
,
even
if
the
judgement
of
conscience
is
likely
to
be
erroneous
(say
because
it
is
inadequately
informed
about
the
facts

or
prevailing
moral
(humanist

norms)
.

^([151])
Failure
to
acknowledge
and
accept
that
conscientious
judgements
can
be
seriously
mistaken
,
may
only
promote
situations
where
one
'
s
conscience
is
manipulated
by
others
to
provide
unwarranted
justifications
for
non-virtuous
and
selfish
acts
;
indeed
,
insofar
as
it
is
appealed
to
as
glorifying
ideological
content
,
and
an
associated
extreme
level
of
devotion
,
without
adequate
constraint
of
external
,
altruistic
,
normative
justification
,
conscience
may
be
considered
morally
blind
and
dangerous
both
to
the
individual
concerned
and
humanity
as
a
whole
.

^([152])
Langston
argues
that
philosophers
of
virtue
ethics
have
unnecessarily
neglected
conscience
for
,
once
conscience
is
trained
so
that
the
principles
and
rules
it
applies
are
those
one
would
want
all
others
to
live
by
,
its
practise
cultivates
and
sustains
the
virtues
;
indeed
,
amongst
people
in
what
each
society
considers
to
be
the
highest
state
of
moral
development
there
is
little
disagreement
about
how
to
act
.

^([8])
Emmanuel
Levinas
viewed
conscience
as
a
revelatory
encountering
of
resistance
to
our
selfish
powers
,
developing
morality
by
calling
into
question
our
naive
sense
of
freedom
of
will
to
use
such
powers
arbitrarily
,
or
with
violence
,
this
process
being
more
severe
the
more
rigorously
the
goal
of
our
self
was
to
obtain
control
.

^([153])
In
other
words
,
the
welcoming
of
the
Other
,
to
Levinas
,
was
the
very
essence
of
conscience
properly
conceived
;
it
encouraged
our
ego
to
accept
the
fallibility
of
assuming
things
about
other
people
,
that
selfish
freedom
of
will
"does
not
have
the
last
word"
and
that
realising
this
has
a
transcendent
purpose
:
"I

John
Rawls
in
his
A
Theory
of
Justice
defines
a
conscientious
objector
as
an
individual
prepared
to
undertake
,
in
public
(and
often
despite
widespread
condemnation)
,
an
action
of
civil
disobedience
to
a
legal
rule
justifying
it
(also
in
public)
by
reference
to
contrary
foundational
social
virtues
(such
as
justice
as
liberty
or
fairness)
and
the
principles
of
morality
and
law
derived
from
them
.

^([160])
Rawls
considered
civil
disobedience
should
be
viewed
as
an
appeal
,
warning
or
admonishment
(showing
general
respect
and
fidelity
to
the
rule
of
law
by
the
non-violence
and
transparency
of
methods
adopted)
that
a
law
breaches
a
community
'
s
fundamental
virtue
of
justice
.

^([160])
Objections
to
Rawls
'

theory
include
first
,
its
inability
to
accommodate
conscientious
objections
to
the
society
'
s
basic
appreciation
of
justice
or
to
emerging
moral
or
ethical
principles
(such
as
respect
for
the
rights
of
the
natural
environment)
which
are
not
yet
part
of
it
and
second
,
the
difficulty
of
predictably
and
consistently
determining
that
a
majority
decision
is
just
or
unjust
.

^([161])
Conscientious
objection
(also
called
conscientious
refusal
or
evasion)
to
obeying
a
law
,
should
not
arise
from
unreasoning
,
naive
"traditional
conscience"
,
for
to
do
so
merely
encourages
infantile
abdication
of
responsibility
to
calibrate
the
law
against
moral
or
human
rights
norms
and
disrespect
for
democratic
institutions
.

^([162])
Instead
it
should
be
based
on
"critical
conscience
'

–
seriously
thought
out
,
conceptually
mature
,
personal
moral
or
religious
beliefs
held
to
be
fundamentally
incompatible
(that
is
,
not
merely
inconsistent
on
the
basis
of
selfish
desires
,
whim
or
impulse)
,
for
example
,
either
with
all
laws
requiring
conscription
for
military
service
,
or
legal
compulsion
to
fight
for
or
financially
support
the
State
in
a
particular
war
.

^([163])
A
famous
example
arose
when
Henry
David
Thoreau
the
author
of
Walden
was
willingly
jailed
for
refusing
to
pay
a
tax
because
he
profoundly
disagreed
with
a
government
policy
and
was
frustrated
by
the
corruption
and
injustice
of
the
democratic
machinery
of
the
state
.

^([164])
A
more
recent
case
concerned
Kimberly
Rivera
,
a
private
in
the
US
Army
and
mother
of
four
children
who
,
having
served
three
months
in
Iraq
War
decided
the
conflict
was
immoral
and
sought
refugee
status
in
Canada
in
2012
(see
List
of
Iraq
War
resisters)
,
but
was
deported
and
arrested
in

Henry

:
Must
the
citizen
ever
for

,
resign
his

"Unjust

shall

or
shall
we

because

it

that

should
do
something
wrong 
.


.


.


It
is
for
no

in

that
I
refuse
to

I

it

In
the
Second
World
War
,
Great
Britain
granted
conscientious-objection
status
not
just
to
complete
pacifists
,
but
to
those
who
objected
to
fighting
in
that
particular
war
;
this
was
done
partly
out
of
genuine
respect
,
but
also
to
avoid
the
disgraceful
and
futile
persecutions
of
conscientious
objectors
that
occurred
during
the
First
World
War
.

^([166])

Amnesty
International
organises
campaigns
to
protect
those
arrested
and
or
incarcerated
as
a
prisoner
of
conscience
because
of
their
conscientious
beliefs
,
particularly
concerning
intellectual
,
political
and
artistic
freedom
of
expression
and
association
.

^([167])
Aung
San
Suu
Kyi
of
Burma
,
was
the
winner
of
the
2009
Amnesty
International
Ambassador
of
Conscience
Award
.


In
legislation
,
a
conscience
clause
is
a
provision
in
a
statute
that
excuses
a
health
professional
from
complying
with
the
law
(for
example
legalising
surgical
or
pharmaceutical
abortion)
if
it
is
incompatible
with
religious
or
conscientious
beliefs
.

^([168])
Expressed
justifications
for
refusing
to
obey
laws
because
of
conscience
vary
.


Many
conscientious
objectors
are
so
for
religious
reasons—notably
,
members
of
the
historic
peace
churches
are
pacifist
by
doctrine
.


Other
objections
can
stem
from
a
deep
sense
of
responsibility
toward
humanity
as
a
whole
,
or
from
the
conviction
that
even
acceptance
of
work
under
military
orders
acknowledges
the
principle
of
conscription
that
should
be
everywhere
condemned
before
the
world
can
ever
become
safe
for
real
democracy
.

^([169])
A
conscientious
objector
,
however
,
does
not
have
a
primary
aim
of
changing
the
law
.

^([160])
John
Dewey
considered
that
conscientious
objectors
were
often
the
victims
of
"moral
innocency"
and
inexpertness
in
moral
training
:
"the
moving
force
of
events
is
always
too
much
for
conscience"
.

^([170])
The
remedy
was
not
to
deplore
the
wickedness
of
those
who
manipulate
world
power
,
but
to
connect
conscience
with
forces
moving
in
another
direction-
to
build
institutions
and
social
environments
predicated
on
the
rule
of
law
,
for
example
,
"then
will
conscience
itself
have
compulsive
power
instead
of
being
forever
the
martyred
and
the
coerced
.

"^([170])
As
an
example
,
Albert
Einstein
who
had
advocated
conscientious
objection
during
the
First
World
War
and
had
been
a
longterm
supporter
of
War
Resisters
'

International
reasoned
that
"radical
pacifism"
could
not
be
justified
in
the
face
of
Nazi
rearmament
and
advocated
a
world
federalist
organization
with
its
own
professional
army
.

^([171])
Samuel
Johnson
pointed
out
that
an
appeal
to
conscience
should
not
allow
the
law
to
bring
unjust
suffering
upon
another
.


Conscience
,
according
to
Johnson
,
was
nothing
more
than
a
conviction
felt
by
ourselves
of
something
to
be
done
or
something
to
be
avoided
;
in
questions
of
simple
unperplexed
morality
,
conscience
is
very
often
a
guide
that
may
be
trusted
.

^([172])
But
before
conscience
can
conclusively
determine
what
morally
should
be
done
,
he
thought
that
the
state
of
the
question
should
be
thoroughly
known
.

^([172])
"No
man
'
s
conscience"
,
said
Johnson
"can
tell
him
the
right
of
another
man 
.


.


.


it
is
a
conscience
very
ill
informed
that
violates
the
rights
of
one
man
,
for
the
convenience
of
another
.

Civil
disobedience
as
nonviolent
protest
or
civil
resistance
are
also
acts
of
conscience
,
but
are
designed
by
those
who
undertake
them
chiefly
to
change
,
by
appealing
to
the
majority
and
democratic
processes
,
laws
or
government
policies
perceived
to
be
incoherent
with

social
virtues
and
principles
(such
as

,
equality
or
respect

human
dignity)
.

^([173])
Civil
disobedience
,
in
a
properly
functioning
democracy
,
allows
a
minority
who
feel
strongly
that
a
law
infringes
their
sense
of
justice
(but
have
no
capacity
to
obtain
legislative
amendments

World
conscience

[edit]

Further
information
:
Comparative
religion
,
Universalism
,
World
government
,
Cosmopolitanism
,
and
Common
heritage
of
humanity

World
conscience
is
the
universalist
idea
that
with
ready
global
communication
,
all
people
on
earth
will
no
longer
be
morally
estranged
from
one
another
,
whether
it
be
culturally
,
ethnically
,
or
geographically
;
instead
they
will
conceive
ethics
from
the
utopian
point
of
view
of
the
universe
,
eternity
or
infinity
,
rather
than
have
their
duties
and
obligations
defined
by
forces
arising
solely
within
the
restrictive
boundaries
of
"blood
and
territory"
.

^([5])

Often
this
derives
from
a
spiritual
or
natural
law
perspective
,
that
for
world
peace
to
be
achieved
,
conscience
,
properly
understood
,
should
be
generally
considered
as
not
necessarily
linked
(often
destructively)
to
fundamentalist
religious
ideologies
,
but
as
an
aspect
of
universal
consciousness
,
access
to
which
is
the
common
heritage
of
humanity
.

^([192])
Thinking
predicated
on
the
development
of
world
conscience
is
common
to
members
of
the
Global
Ecovillage
Network
such
as
the
Findhorn
Foundation
,
international
conservation
organisations
like
Fauna
and
Flora
International
,

^([193])
Non-government
organizations
,
particularly
through
their
work
in
agenda-setting
,
policy-making
and
implementation
of
human
rights-related
policy
,
have
been
referred
to
as
the
conscience
of
the
world^([194])

Edward
O
Wilson
has
developed
the
idea
of
consilience
to
encourage
coherence
of
global
moral
and
scientific
knowledge
supporting
the
premise
that
"only
unified
learning
,
universally
shared
,
makes
accurate
foresight
and
wise
choice
possible"
.

^([195])
Thus
,
world
conscience
is
a
concept
that
overlaps
with
the
Gaia
hypothesis
in
advocating
a
balance
of
moral
,
legal
,
scientific
and
economic
solutions
to
modern
transnational
problems
such
as
global
poverty
and
global
warming
,
through
strategies
such
as
environmental
ethics
,
climate
ethics
,
natural
conservation
,
ecology
,
cosmopolitanism
,
sustainability
and
sustainable
development
,
biosequestration
and
legal
protection
of
the
biosphere
and
biodiversity
.

A
challenge
to

provided
by
an
influential
1968
article

analyzed
the
dilemma

multiple

rationally
consulting
self-interest
(and
,
he
claimed

the
apparently
low

'

actions)

Crime
and
Punishment

The
ancient
epic
of
the
Indian
subcontinent
,
the
Mahabharata
of
Vyasa
,
contains
two
pivotal
moments
of
conscience
.


The
first
occurs
when
the
warrior
Arjuna
being
overcome
with
compassion
against
killing
his
opposing
relatives
in
war
,
receives
counsel
(see
Bhagavad-Gita)
from
Krishna
about
his
spiritual
duty
("work
as
though
you
are
performing
a
sacrifice
for
the
general
good")
.

^([259])
The
second
,
at
the
end
of
the
saga
,
is
when
king
Yudhishthira
having
alone
survived
the
moral
tests
of
life
,
is
offered
eternal
bliss
,
only
to
refuse
it
because
a
faithful
dog
is
prevented
from
coming
with
him
by
purported
divine
rules

laws

The
French
author
Montaigne
(1533–1592)
in
one
of

celebrated
of

essays

experience")
expressed
the
benefits
of
living
with
a
clear
conscience
:
"Our
duty
is
to
compose
our
character
,
not
to
compose
books
,
to
win
not
battles
and
provinces
,
but
order
and
tranquillity
in
our
conduct
.


Our
great
and
glorious
masterpiece
is
to
live
properly"

Hamlet
and
Horatio
in

Graveyard
(1839

The
critic
A
.


C
.


Bradley
discusses
the
central
problem
of
Shakespeare
'
s
tragic
character
Hamlet
as
one
where
conscience
in
the
form
of
moral
scruples
deters
the
young
Prince
with
his
"great
anxiety
to
do
right"
from
obeying
his
father
'
s
hell-bound
ghost
and
murdering
the
usurping
King
("is
'
t
not
perfect
conscience
to
quit
him
with
this
arm
?

"
(v

.

^([264])

Bradley
develops
a
theory
about
Hamlet
'
s
moral
agony
relating
to
a
conflict
between
"traditional"
and
"critical"
conscience
:
"The
conventional
moral
ideas
of
his
time
,
which
he
shared
with
the
Ghost
,
told
him
plainly
that
he
ought
to
avenge
his
father
;
but
a
deeper
conscience
in
him
,
which
was
in
advance
of
his
time
,
contended
with
these
explicit
conventional
ideas
.


It
is
because
this
deeper
conscience
remains
below
the
surface
that
he
fails
to
recognise
it
,
and
fancies
he
is
hindered
by
cowardice
or
sloth
or
passion
or
what
not
;
but
it
emerges
into
light
in
that
speech
to
Horatio
.


And
it
is
just
because
he
has
this
nobler
moral
nature
in
him
that
we
admire
and
love
him"
.

Shakespeare

have
been
admired

Anton
Chekhov
in
his
plays
The
Seagull

Uncle
Vanya

Sisters
describes
the
tortured
emotional
states
of
doctors
who
at
some
point
in
their
careers
have
turned
their
back
on
conscience
.

^([268])
In
his
short
stories
,
Chekhov
also
explored
how
people
misunderstood
the
voice
of
a
tortured
conscience
.


A
promiscuous
student
,
for
example
,
in
The
Fit
describes
it
as
a
"dull
pain
,
indefinite
,
vague
;
it
was
like
anguish
and
the
most
acute
fear
and
despair 
.


.


.


in
his
breast
,
under
the
heart"
and
the
young
doctor
examining
the
misunderstood
agony
of
compassion
experienced
by
the
factory
owner
'
s
daughter
in
From
a
Case
Book
calls
it
an
"unknown
,
mysterious
power 
.


.


.


in
fact
close
at
hand
and
watching
him
.

"^([269])
Characteristically
,
Chekhov
'
s
own
conscience
drove
him
on
the
long
journey
to
Sakhalin
to
record
and
alleviate
the
harsh
conditions
of
the
prisoners
at
that
remote
outpost
.


As
Irina
Ratushinskaya
writes
in
the
introduction
to
that
work
:
"Abandoning
everything
,
he
travelled
to
the
distant
island
of
Sakhalin
,
the
most
feared
place
of
exile
and
forced
labour
in
Russia
at
that
time
.


One
cannot
help
but
wonder
why
?


Simply
,
because
the
lot
of
the
people
there
was
a
bitter
one
,
because
nobody
really
knew
about
the
lives
and
deaths
of
the
exiles
,
because
he
felt
that
they
stood
in
greater
need
of
help
that
anyone
else
.


A
strange
reason
,
maybe
,
but
not
for
a
writer
who
was
the
epitome
of
all
the
best
traditions
of
a
Russian
man
of
letters
.


Russian
literature
has
always
focused
on
questions
of
conscience
and
was
,
therefore
,
a
powerful
force
in
the
moulding
of
public
opinion

Types
of
Conscience

Text
:
1
Timothy
1
:5

One
of
the
goals
of
preaching/teaching
the
word
of
God
is
a
“good
conscience
.

”
Our
conscience
is
designed
to
help
guide
us
to
do
what
is
right
(“right”
depends
on
how
it
is
trained)
.


If
we
want
to
accomplish
this
goal
,
we
need
to
understand
more
about
the
conscience
.


There
are
at
least
six
different
types
of
conscience
addressed
in
the
New
Testament
.


We
will
consider
them
here
.



Good
Conscience

-
A good
conscience
is
one
which
is
free
from
guilt
–
we
are
doing

what
we
believe
to
be
right
;
used
two
different
ways
in
the
NT
(of

those
who
did
right
and
those
who
did
wrong)
-
Those
who
do
right
are
to
have
a good
conscience
(1
Timothy
1
:5)
–

keep
a
good
conscience
(1
Timothy
1
:19)
;
if
we
follow
God
,
we
can

have
confidence
,
not
fear
(1
John
3
:21
;
2
:28-29)
-
However
,
it
is
possible
to
do wrong
and
have
a good
conscience
(Acts

23
:1)
–
Paul
did
many
things
against
Christ
(Acts
26
:9-11
;
1
Timothy

1
:13-15)
;
he
believed
he
was
right
(Acts
24
:16)
-
Many
have
a good
conscience
because
they
do
what
“seems
right”
to

them
(Proverbs
14
:12)
–
but
this
is
not
enough

Defiled
Conscience

-
A defiled
conscience
is
one
which
causes
one
to
feel
guilt
for
doing

what
is
either
right
or
innocent
– right
is
something
required
by

God
(2
Timothy
3
:16-17)
; innocent
is
not
right
or
wrong
in
itself

(Romans
14
:2-3)
-
In
Corinth
,
some
had
a defiled
conscience
(1
Corinthians
8
:7)
–
much

of
the
meat
sold
in
the
markets
in
Corinth
had
been
used
previously

in
idol
worship
;
Paul
explained
that
buying/eating
it
did
not

constitute
participation
in
idolatry
(1
Corinthians
8
:4-6)
-
However
,
those
“accustomed
to
the
idol”
could
not
separate
the
idol

worship
from
eating
(1
Corinthians
8
:7)
–
for
them
,
to
eat
would

violate
their
conscience
and
embolden
them
to
sin
(1
Corinthians

8
:10-11
;
cf
.


Romans
14
:23)
-
If
one
has
a defiled
conscience
,
they
need
to
be
patiently
taught

the
truth
(Romans
14
:1
;
cf
.


Acts
18
:26)

Seared
Conscience

-
A seared
conscience
is
one
that
no
longer
feels
guilt
for
sin
–

whether
one
followed
the
right
or
wrong
standard
,
it
is
a
conscience

that
has
been
violated
so
many
times
that
it
no
longer
works
-
The
Spirit
warned
of
those
who
would
fall
away
due
to
a seared

conscience
(1
Timothy
4
:1-2)
–
when
one
sins
,
godly
sorrow
leads
him

to
repentance
(2
Corinthians
7
:10)
;
feels
guilty
,
wants
to
be
right
-
But
when
sin
becomes persistent
and
habitual
,
guilt
is
no
longer

there
(Genesis
6
:5
;
Jeremiah
6
:15)
-
A seared
conscience
is
prevented
by
laying
aside
sin
(Hebrews
12
:1)

rather
than
continuing
in
it
(2
Timothy
3
:13)
–
if
one
has
a seared

conscience
,
little
can
be
done
until
they
have
a
change
of
heart

(Hebrews
6
:4-6)

Weak
Conscience

-
A weak
conscience
is
one
that
has
simply
not
been
trained
in
what
is

right
–
lacks
knowledge
from
God
that
provides
the
right
standard
-
In
Corinth
,
a weak
conscience
led
to
a defiled
conscience
(1

Corinthians
8
:7)
–
lacked
knowledge
;
one
can
have
a weak
conscience

and
also
have
a good
conscience
(Acts
23
:1
;
1
Timothy
1
:13)
-
The
remedy
for
a
weak
conscience
is training
in
the
word
of
God

(Hebrews
5
:14)

Evil
Conscience

-
An evil
conscience
is
one
that
has
not
been
forgiven
of
sin
(Hebrews

10
:22)
-
All
have
had
an evil
conscience
at
some
point
(Romans
3
:23)
–

forgiveness
is
found
in
Christ
(Hebrews
9
:14
;
Ephesians
1
:7)
;
this

cleanses
the evil
conscience

Clear
(Pure)
Conscience

-
A clear
(pure
,
KJV)
conscience
is
one
that
has
been
forgiven
(1

Timothy
3
:9)
–
cleansed
by
Christ
;
this
is
the good
conscience
of

those
who
do
right
(1
Timothy
1
:5
,
19
;
1
Peter
3
:16)
-
We
cannot
purify
our
conscience
on
our
own
–
must
appeal
to
God
to

do
it
(1
Peter
3
:21)
-
God
cleanses
us
when
we
obey
the
gospel
(Romans
6
:3-4)
–
continues

to
as
we
obey
(1
John
1
:7)

Conclusion

-
The
goal
of
our
instruction
is
a
“good
conscience”
–
but
goodness
is

by
God’s
standard
,
not
man’s
-
It
is
not
enough
for
us
to
think
we
are
doing
what
is
right
–
we

must
actually
be
right
;
involves
knowledge
,
obedience
,
and

forgiveness
-
We
can
have
“our
hearts
sprinkled
clean
from
an
evil
conscience”

(Hebrews
10
:22)
–
done
in
baptism
;
appeal
for
a
good
conscience
(1

Peter
3
:21)
;
receive
forgiveness
(Acts
22
:16)

Conscience
–
An
Evil
Conscience
,
Part
4
–
Good
and
evil
are
the
only
two
forms
of
conscience
.



[Study
Aired
November
4
,
2023]

Our
inherent
nature
of
an
evil
conscience
knows
to
do
good
and
doesn’t
.


Such
a
one
rightly
divides
the
truth
from
error
and
is
bewitched
to
disobediently
choose
error
.




1Pe
3
:15 
But
sanctify
the
Lord
God
in
your
hearts
[where
conscience

resides]
:
and
be
ready
always
to
give
an
answer
to
every
man
that

asketh
you
a
reason
of
the
hope
that
is
in
you
with
meekness
and
fear

[prompted
by
a
good
conscience
.


How
?

]
:

1Pe
3
:16 
Having
a
good
conscience
;
that
,
whereas
they
speak
evil
of

you
,
as
of
evildoers
,
they
may
be
ashamed
that
falsely
accuse
your

good
conversation
in
Christ
.




Heb
10
:22
Let
us
draw
near
with
a
true
heart
in
full
assurance
of

faith
,
having
our
hearts
sprinkled
from
an
evil
conscience
,
and
our

bodies
washed
with
pure
water
.



Hebrews
10
:22
is
the
only
verse
in
the
Bible
that
directly
refers
to
an
“evil
conscience
.

”
However
,
as
previously
pointed
out
,
the
Bible
abounds
with
stark
nuances
of
both
forms
of
a
good
or
evil
conscience
.


It
is
impossible
to
speak
about
specific
evil
consciences
without
juxtaposing
them
with
their
corresponding
good
conscience
.



As
we
have
seen
in
the
preceding
studies
,
a
‘good
conscience’
is
dramatically
differentiated
by
Adam
and
Eve
partaking
of
the
Tree
of
the
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
.


Subsequently
,
a
pandora’s
box
of
evil
conscience
blooms
like
leavening
in
bread
dough
.



As
such
,
Mr
Barid’s
order
of
sixteen
headings
for
his
conscience
study
does
not
descend
in
order
of
authority
,
but
rather
it
is
in
order
of
scriptural
reference
.

An
Abandoned
Conscience

Our
study
today
is
on
an
“Evil
Conscience”
,
yet
when
we
review
the
above
headings
,
the
vast
majority
of
them
are
all
aspects
of
an
evil
conscience
.


Nonetheless
,
it
is
the
Saint’s
God-given
passion
to
study
every
detail
of
His
word
,
leaving
nothing
alive
that
breathes
of
misunderstanding
and
thus
our
continuation
of
the
sixteen
mostly
evil
versions
of
our
conscience
.



Clearly
,
Adam
and
Cain
within
us
initiated
the
many
forms
of
evil
consciences
,
yet
the
first
time
the
term
is
directly
used
is
in
Hebrews
10
:22
,
the
entire
Bible
bleeding
defiled
evil
consciences
from
the
beginning
to
near
the
end
.



Hebrews
10
admonishes
us
to
remain
faithful
to
the
New
Covenant
in
Christ
and
not
regress
to
the
Laws
of
Moses
so
etched
in
our
hearts
that
we
temporarily
battle
a
dual
of
tortured
consciences
as
Paul
did
regarding
circumcision
.




Heb
10
:19 
Having
therefore
,
brethren
,
boldness
to
enter
into
the

holiest
by
the
blood
of
Jesus
,

Heb
10
:20 
By
a
new
and
living
way
[one
that
literally
leads
to
life

eternal]
,
which
he
hath
consecrated
for
us
,
through
the
veil
,
that
is

to
say
,
his
flesh
[revealing
the
path
to
a
more
excellent
conscience]
;

Heb
10
:21 
And
having
an
high
priest
over
the
house
of
God
;

Heb
10
:22 
Let
us
draw
near
with
a
true
heart
in
full
assurance
of

faith
,
having
our
hearts
sprinkled
[a
sprinkle
(little
by
little)
is

the
beginning
of
a
storm
,
a
flood
of
truth]
from
an
evil
conscience
,

and
our
bodies
washed
with
pure
water
.



Heb
10
:23 
Let
us
hold
fast
the
[new]
profession
of
our
faith
without

wavering
;
(for
he
is
faithful
that
promised
;) 

Christ’s
mission
was
to
declare
the
Father
and
our
worship
of
Him
in
spirit
and
in
truth
.


Formally
,
Israel
worshiped
God
by
attempting
to
keep
His
laws
through
physical
washings
and
sacrifices
that
most
certainly
caused
His
people
a
good
conscience
via
those
laws
.


Yet
,
as
depicted
by
Saul
,
who
became
Paul
,
his
pricked
conscience
while
under
the
slavery
of
the
Old
Covenant
was
subliminally
aware
of
a
strange
new
conscience
opposing
most
turbulently
his
established
beliefs
.


Paul’s
boldness
became
dramatically
evident
through
his
earthquake
of
miraculous
blindness
as
he
whimpered
,
‘”Who
art
thou
,
Lord
?

”
And
the
Lord
said
,
I
am
Jesus
whom
thou
persecutest
:
it
is
hard
for
thee
to
kick
against
the
pricks
.

’
(Acts
9)

Paul’s
conscience
was
kicking
against
the
pricks
of
his
murderous
ways
and
imploring
eyes
staring
back
at
him
upon
his
many
stonings
as
he
demanded
the
church
of
the
day
adhere
to
Moses’s
laws
;
subliminally
,
he
couldn’t
identify
why
these
people
over
whom
he
lorded
authority
couldn’t
and
wouldn’t
remain
as
faithful
as
he
.


A
new
disconcerting
spirit
of
change
was
blowing
upon
his
mind
.



By
the
one
who
had
the
power
to
change
the
way
mankind
worshiped
God
,
Christ
cast
aside
the
physicality
of
the
Old
Covenant
to
create
in
man
a
worship
of
God
by
the
same
laws
,
only
by
spirit
and
not
by
sweat
.


It
was
a
shift
in
how
each
of
us
now
perceived
what
constituted
an
‘evil
conscience’
and
was
earth-shattering
.


That
seismic
shift
in
how
to
live
by
the
Law
was
quickly
realized
to
be
immensely
liberating
.


Its
overpowering
joy
eclipsed
martyrdom
,
as
Steven
exemplified
in
Acts
7
.




Heb
7
:11 
If
therefore
perfection
were
by
the
Levitical
priesthood
,

(for
under
it
the
people
received
the
law
,)
what
further
need
was

there
that
another
priest
should
rise
after
the
order
of
Melchisedec
,

and
not
be
called
after
the
order
of
Aaron
?

 

Heb
7
:12 
For
the
priesthood
being
changed
,
there
is
made
of
necessity

a
change
also
of
the
law
.

 

Heb
7
:13 
For
he
of
whom
these
things
are
spoken
pertaineth
to
another

tribe
,
of
which
no
man
gave
attendance
at
the
altar
.

 

Heb
7
:14 
For
it
is
evident
that
our
Lord
sprang
out
of
Juda
;
of
which

tribe
Moses
spake
nothing
concerning
priesthood
.



Unlike
Paul
,
Moses
wasn’t
given
or
ready
to
have
his
conscience
pricked
by
a
better
conscience
by
the
holy
spirit…


Heb
7
:15 
And
it
is
yet
far
more
evident
:
for
that
after
the

similitude
of
Melchisedec
there
ariseth
another
priest
, 

Heb
7
:16 
Who
is
made
,
not
after
the
law
of
a
carnal
commandment
,
but

after
the
power
of
an
endless
life
.

 

Heb
7
:17 
For
he
testifieth
,
Thou
art
a
priest
for
ever
after
the

order
of
Melchisedec
.

 

Heb
7
:18 
For
there
is
verily
a
disannulling
of
the
commandment
going

before
for
the
weakness
and
unprofitableness
thereof
.



Heb
7
:19 
For
the
law
made
nothing
perfect
,
but
the
bringing
in
of
a

better
hope
did
;
by
the
which
we
draw
nigh
unto
God
.

 

Heb
7
:20 
And
inasmuch
as
not
without
an
oath
he
was
made
priest
:

Heb
7
:21 
(For
those
priests
were
made
without
an
oath
;
but
this
with

an
oath
by
him
that
said
unto
him
,
The
Lord
sware
and
will
not
repent
,

Thou
art
a
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
Melchisedec
:) 

Heb
7
:22 
By
so
much
was
Jesus
made
a
surety
of
a
better
testament
.



Heb
7
:23 
And
they
truly
were
many
priests
,
because
they
were
not

suffered
to
continue
by
reason
of
death
: 

Heb
7
:24 
But
this
man
,
because
he
continueth
ever
,
hath
an

unchangeable
priesthood
.



…
governed
by
a
pure
conscience
.

 


Heb
7
:25 
Wherefore
he
is
able
also
to
save
them
to
the
uttermost
that

come
unto
God
by
him
,
seeing
he
ever
liveth
to
make
intercession
for

them
.



Heb
7
:26 
For
such
an
high
priest
became
us
,
who
is
holy
,
harmless
[a

pure
conscience
casts
out
all
fear]
,
undefiled
,
separate
from
sinners
,

and
made
higher
than
the
heavens
; 

Heb
7
:27 
Who
needeth
not
daily
,
as
those
high
priests
,
to
offer
up

sacrifice
,
first
for
his
own
sins
,
and
then
for
the
people’s
:
for
this

he
did
once
,
when
he
offered
up
himself
.

 

Heb
7
:28 
For
the
law
maketh
men
high
priests
which
have
infirmity
;

but
the
word
of
the
oath
,
which
was
since
the
law
,
maketh
the
Son
,
who

is
consecrated
for
evermore
.

 

Hebrews
7
highlights
the
most
profound
shift
of
a
good
conscience
to
a
means
to
attain
a
pure
conscience
through
Christ
,
our
High
Priest
.


Stephen
was
so
committed
to
the
spirit
of
a
‘good
conscience’
of
greater
purity
that
he
was
willing
to
be
martyred
.


Stephen
,
Christ
and
all
the
martyrs
of
old
,
all
died
having
acted
in
good
faith
in
accordance
with
their
consciences
defying
an
‘evil
conscience’
,
and
so
,
too
,
does
the
Bride
of
Christ
.


From
that
foundation
arises
the
focus
of
this
study
and
our
immovable
confidence…


Heb
10
:22 
Let
us
draw
near
with
a
true
heart
in
full
assurance
of

faith
,
having
our
hearts
sprinkled
from
an
evil
conscience
,
and
our

bodies
washed
with
pure
water
.



For
those
given
understanding
,
what
a
glorious
and
most
joyful
release
it
is
to
be
under
Christ’s
light
yoke
,
where
he
is
the
author
of
the
Temple
he
is
constructing
.



The
following
scriptures
annul
an
evil
conscience
.




1Jn
3
:18 
My
little
children
,
let
us
not
love
in
word
,
neither
in

tongue
;
but
in
deed
and
in
truth
.

 

1Jn
3
:19 
And
hereby
we
know
that
we
are
of
the
truth
,
and
shall

assure
our
hearts
before
him
.



There
in
the
above
scripture
lies
a
conscience
that
is
a
foundation
to
rightly
discern
the
truth
,
and
in
the
below
scripture
,
the
bisection
of
choosing
by
His
will
a
good
or
evil
conscience
.




1Jn
3
:20 
For
if
our
heart
condemn
us
,
God
is
greater
than
our
heart
,

and
knoweth
all
things
.



If
we
are
an
Elect
of
God
,
He
assures
us
that
our
heart
,
that
is
,
our
mind
,
will
know
the
difference
between
a
good
and
evil
conscience
,
and
our
Lord
will
provide
the
power
for
us
to
ultimately
learn
to
choose
righteously
.




1Jn
3
:21 
Beloved
,
if
our
heart
condemn
us
not
,
then
have
we

confidence
toward
God
.



1Jn
3
:22 
And
whatsoever
we
ask
,
we
receive
of
him
,
because
we
keep

his
commandments
,
and
do
those
things
that
are
pleasing
in
his
sight
.



How
easy
is
it
to
simply
ask
our
Lord
to
give
us
a
pure
conscience
in
all
that
we
think
.


If
we
thus
have
that
pure
conscience
,
we
are
keeping
all
the
commandments
of
Christ
,
and
our
hope
in
the
First
Resurrection
,
Lord
willing
,
will
be
assured
.




1Jn
3
:23 
And
this
is
his
commandment
,
That
we
should
believe
on
the

name
of
his
Son
Jesus
Christ
,
and
love
one
another
,
as
he
gave
us

commandment
.



1Jn
3
:24 
And
he
that
keepeth
his
commandments
dwelleth
in
him
,
and
he

in
him
.


And
hereby
we
know
that
he
abideth
in
us
,
by
the
spirit
which

he
hath
given
us
[in
practising
a
good
conscience]
.



We
have
seen
that
we
can’t
have
light
without
knowing
darkness
,
and
comparably
,
a
good
conscience
without
knowing
an
evil
conscience
.


Let’s
review
some
everyday
examples
of
us
being
assailed
by
an
evil
conscience
,
namely
the
seemingly
imperishable
lust
of
the
eyes
,
the
lust
of
the
flesh
and
the
pride
of
life
.



In
the
Old
Covenant
,
an
evil
conscience
was
somewhat
foreign
to
lust
yet
still
pricked
their
consciences
.




Mat
19
:8 
He
[Christ]
saith
unto
them
[the
Apostles]
,
Moses
because
of

the
hardness
of
your
hearts
suffered
you
to
put
away
your
wives
:
but

from
the
beginning
it
was
not
so
.



Mat
19
:9 
And
I
say
unto
you
,
Whosoever
shall
put
away
his
wife
,

except
it
be
for
fornication
,
and
shall
marry
another
,
committeth

adultery
:
and
whoso
marrieth
her
which
is
put
away
doth
commit

adultery
.

 

Wow
!


What
an
indictment
of
a
good
conscience
that
mankind
,
subliminally
from
the
beginning
,
as
did
Adam
,
Eve
and
Cain
at
heart
,
knew
by
their
subsequent
actions
of
hiding
,
revealed
an
evil
heart
against
what
constituted
a
good
conscience
.




Mat
5
:27 
Ye
have
heard
that
it
was
said
by
them
of
old
time
,
Thou

shalt
not
commit
adultery
: 

Mat
5
:28 
But
I
say
unto
you
,
That
whosoever
looketh
on
a
woman
to

lust
after
her
hath
committed
adultery
with
her
already
in
his
heart
.



In
Matthew
5
,
Christ
is
instituting
the
spirit
of
keeping
all
His
commandments
,
resulting
in
growing
a
perfect
conscience
as
He
and
the
Father
perpetually
exist
without
contrast
.



Yet
,
like
Cain
and
Paul
,
their
consciences
beheld
a
shadowy
dichotomy
of
a
pricked
conscience
suggesting
something
(spiritually)
awry
.


With
that
same
conscience
,
Solomon
,
who
is
who
we
are
before
knowing
Christ
,
withheld
from
himself
no
lust
,
as
seen
in
Ecclesiastes
2
:10
.


Solomon
and
everyone
under
the
Old
Covenant
were
blessed
materially
for
their
lawful
dedication
to
loving
God
.


Their
physical
wealth
denoted
their
love
for
God
in
a
shadowy
good
conscience
and
was
evidence
of
their
righteous
living
.




Deu
11
:26 
Behold
,
I
[The
Lord
before
Israel]
set
before
you
this
day

a
blessing
and
a
curse
;

Deu
11
:27 
A
blessing
,
if
ye
obey
the
commandments
of
the
LORD
your

God
,
which
I
command
you
this
day
[and
resulting
good
conscience]
:

Deu
11
:28 
And
a
curse
,
if
ye
will
not
obey
the
commandments
of
the

LORD
your
God
[and
resulting
evil
conscience]
,
but
turn
aside
out
of

the
way
which
I
command
you
this
day
,
to
go
after
other
gods
,
which
ye

have
not
known
[and
assuredly
a
resulting
evil
conscience]
.



As
earlier
expressed
,
much
later
Achan
,
under
those
commandments
,
 knew
by
his
evil
conscience
that
he
had
done
wrong
since
he
hid
his
treasure
in
the
ground
beneath
his
tent
.


The
spirit
of
keeping
the
Lord’s
commands
was
already
evident
by
the
conviction
of
their
Old
Covenant
hearts
.



Jesus
,
being
flesh
,
lived
in
perfectly
good
conscience
,
yet
He
knew
that
He
was
subject
to
an
evil
conscience
by
virtue
of
being
tempted
to
acquiesce
with
an
evil
conscience
in
submitting
to
the
Devil’s
wiles
~
evil
was
present
within
His
flesh
as
it
is
in
us
,
yet
he
didn’t
sin
,
but
we
do
.




Mar
10
:18 
And
Jesus
said
unto
him
,
Why
callest
thou
me
good
?


there
is

none
good
but
one
,
that
is
,
God
.



We
all
,
as
Solomon
,
if
given
to
honestly
study
our
consciences
,
would
conclude
that
our
lusts
are
vanity
,
a
vapour
of
joy
unable
to
be
retained
.


Solomon
came
close
to
understanding
the
misty
conclusion
of
his
polarised
conscience
,
confusing
him
while
he
did
his
best
to
live
by
the
Laws
of
Moses
,
and
yet
knew
some
unidentifiable
spirit
couldn’t
be
grasped
.


That
missing
something
was
the
unheard-of
holy
spirit
that
urges
a
pure
conscience
that
later
,
in
his
experiences
with
the
Shulamite
he
frustratingly
continued
to
see
blackness
.


Christ’s
love
isn’t
awakened
in
Solomon
and
the
world
until
He
pleases
in
the
Resurrection
to
Judgment
(Son
8
:4)
.


The
Lord’s
double
portion
of
love
in
the
brilliant
light
of
His
word
is
only
awakened
in
His
Bride
since
Christ
.




Ecc
1
:12 
I
the
Preacher
was
king
over
Israel
in
Jerusalem
.



Ecc
1
:13 
And
I
gave
my
heart
to
seek
and
search
out
by
wisdom

concerning
all
things
that
are
done
under
heaven
:
this
sore
travail

hath
God
given
to
the
sons
of
man
to
be
exercised
therewith
.



Life’s
experiences
only
produced
struggles
against
sin
to
be
always
faced
with
the
junction
of
choosing
,
by
our
Lord’s
hand
,
a
pathway
of
either
a
good
or
evil
conscience
.




Ecc
1
:14 
I
have
seen
all
the
works
that
are
done
under
the
sun
;
and
,

behold
,
all
is
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
.



Our
works
always
cause
us
to
constantly
be
vexed
by
having
to
choose
the
route
of
a
good
or
evil
conscience
.

 


Ecc
1
:15 
That
which
is
crooked
cannot
be
made
straight
:
and
that

which
is
wanting
cannot
be
numbered
.



We
are
constantly
besieged
by
the
choice
of
a
good
or
evil
pathway
of
conscience
.

 


Pro
21
:8 
The
way
of
him
that
is
laden
with
guilt
is
exceeding

crooked
;
But
as
for
the
pure
[conscience]
,
his
work
is
right
.




Ecc
1
:16 
I
communed
with
mine
own
heart
[my
conscience
!

]
,
saying
,
Lo
,

I
am
come
to
great
estate
,
and
have
gotten
more
wisdom
than
all
they

that
have
been
before
me
in
Jerusalem
:
yea
,
my
heart
had
great

experience
of
wisdom
and
knowledge
.



Ecc
1
:17 
And
I
gave
my
heart
to
know
wisdom
,
and
to
know
madness
and

folly
:
I
perceived
that
this
also
is
vexation
of
spirit
.



There
in
that
preceding
verse
is
Solomon’s
Shulamite-like
vexation
of
knowing
that
unidentifiable
something
we
know
as
the
holy
spirit
was
missing
from
his
vast
wisdom
.




Ecc
1
:18 
For
in
much
wisdom
is
much
grief
:
and
he
that
increaseth

knowledge
increaseth
sorrow
.

 

Without
the
holy
spirit
to
prick
our
consciences
,
when
in
Babylon
,
we
as
did
Solomon
,
experienced
an
indefinable
sorrow
where
immense
physical
prosperity
and
wives
(churches)
eluded
our
quest
for
peace
and
perfect
joy
,
always
searching
but
never
coming
to
the
truth
.


Our
dichotic
consciences
increased
sorrow
.




Ecc
2
:9 
So
I
was
great
,
and
increased
more
than
all
that
were
before

me
in
Jerusalem
:
also
my
wisdom
remained
with
me
.



Ecc
2
:10 
And
whatsoever
mine
eyes
desired
I
kept
not
from
them
,
I

withheld
not
my
heart
from
any
joy
;
for
my
heart
rejoiced
in
all
my

labour
:
and
this
was
my
portion
of
all
my
labour
.



There
is
some
truth
that
,
in
good
conscience
,
particularly
Solomon
in
his
time
,
and
remnants
of
us
in
Babylon
believe
that
it
is
our
right
to
pursue
any
joy
of
the
flesh
as
long
as
we
use
our
“wisdom”
to
not
directly
contravene
Christ’s
laws
.


The
major
snag
is
that
riches
afford
unrestrained
pursuit
of
pleasure
,
so
the
more
powerful
bias
is
to
love
them
more
than
our
Lord’s
greater
riches
of
His
commandments
.




Gal
5
:16 
This
I
say
then
,
Walk
in
the
Spirit
,
and
ye
shall
not
fulfil

the
lust
of
the
flesh
.

 

Gal
5
:17 
For
the
flesh
lusteth
against
the
Spirit
,
and
the
Spirit

against
the
flesh
:
and
these
are
contrary
the
one
to
the
other
:
so

that
ye
cannot
do
the
things
that
ye
would
.




Luk
14
:26 
If
any
man
come
to
me
,
and
hate
not
his
father
,
and
mother
,

and
wife
,
and
children
,
and
brethren
,
and
sisters
,
yea
,
and
his
own

life
also
,
he
cannot
be
my
disciple
.

 

Luk
14
:27 
And
whosoever
doth
not
bear
his
cross
,
and
come
after
me
,

cannot
be
my
disciple
.




Mat
19
:29 
And
every
one
that
hath
forsaken
houses
,
or
brethren
,
or

sisters
,
or
father
,
or
mother
,
or
wife
,
or
children
,
or
lands
,
for
my

name’s
sake
,
shall
receive
an
hundredfold
,
and
shall
inherit

everlasting
life
.



With
an
elusive
Shulamite-like
epiphany
,
Solomon
was
further
vexed
by
his
conscience
.


With
classic
introspection
,
he
says
, 


Ecc
2
:11 
Then
I
looked
on
all
the
works
that
my
hands
had
wrought
,

and
on
the
labour
that
I
had
laboured
to
do
:
and
,
behold
,
all
was

vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
,
and
there
was
no
profit
under
the
sun
.



How
utterly
frustrating
it
is
in
Babylon
when
a
mist
of
Christ’s
spirit
,
for
the
most
part
,
veils
our
conscience
.


When
given
a
Stephen-like
revelation
upon
keeping
all
the
commandments
of
God
,
a
good
conscience
hailstones
our
understanding
,
washing
away
the
multitude
of
lies
and
outshining
all
vexations
of
darkness
.



Probably
the
most
exceptional
lust
for
a
male
is
what
is
highlighted
in
being
taken
out
of
him
in
the
form
of
a
woman
.


If
the
majority
of
his
femininity
wasn’t
placed
in
front
of
him
in
the
form
of
Eve
to
see
himself
,
he
would
have
had
only
a
vague
Solomon-like
understanding
of
his
evil
nature
.


Being
face-to-face
with
his
own
flesh
is
highly
arousing
to
lust
for
all
kinds
of
spiritual
ethnicities
(as
did
Solomon
~
and
us
~
with
captivating
doctrines)
while
not
understanding
that
they
all
represent
the
same
ruling
deception
.


A
man’s
wife
mirrors
himself
as
having
a
heart
that
ensnares
his
conscience
with
evil
and
fetters
his
hands
to
‘excuse’
himself
and
hide
from
sin
(Ecc
7
:25-29)
.


She
is
the
reflection
of
his
narcissism
,
and
he
is
unwittingly
taken
by
his
own
beauty
,
having
ascended
to
heaven
unconsciously
to
presume
a
dethroning
of
God
.


While
pricked
by
a
good
conscience
,
he
is
so
easily
led
away
by
his
lust
and
conceit
to
be
god
;
flattering
himself
seems
the
more
,
at
least
,
temporal
joy
.


Like
Esau’s
fleeting
passion
to
satiate
his
famished
state
,
we
always
have
time
to
reflect
upon
our
choice
of
conscience
.


If
a
semblance
of
righteousness
resides
,
we
should
be
stabbed
through
our
liver
with
an
evil
conscience
for
not
fully
considering
the
Lord’s
commandments
.




Pro
6
:23 
For
the
commandment
is
a
lamp
;
and
the
law
is
light
;
and

reproofs
of
instruction
are

of
life
: [and
peace
through
a
good

conscience]

Pro

:24 
To
keep
thee
from
the
evil

,
from
the
flattery
of
the

tongue
of
a
strange

strange
woman
within
ruling
our

conscience]
.



Pro
6
:25 
Lust
not
after
her
beauty
in
thine
heart
;
neither
let
her

take
thee
with
her
eyelids
.

 

Pro
6
:26 
For
by
means
of
a
whorish
woman
a
man
is
brought
to
a
piece

of
bread
:
and
the
adulteress
will
hunt
for
the
precious
life [we
buy

our
own
lies
by
indulging
the
whore
within]
.



Pro
6
:27 
Can
a
man
take
fire
in
his
bosom
,
and
his
clothes
not
be

burned
?

 

Pro

Can
one
go
upon
hot
coals

and
his
feet

Pro

:29 
So
he
that
goeth
in
to
his
neighbour’s
wife
;
whosoever

toucheth
her
shall
not
be
innocent
.

 

Satan
went
into
Eve
,
Adam’s
wife
,
tempted
her
and
spiritually
impregnated
her
mind
with
his
lying
spirit
of
another
Jesus
~
insidiously
,
himself
.




Jas
1
:12 
Blessed
is
the
man
that
endureth
temptation
[In
this
case

choosing
a
good
or
evil
conscience]
:
for
when
he
is
tried
,
he
shall

receive
the
crown
of
life
,
which
the
Lord
hath
promised
to
them
that

love
him
.

 

Jas
1
:13 
Let
no
man
say
when
he
is
tempted
,
I
am
tempted
of
God
:
for

God
cannot
be
tempted
with
evil
,
neither
tempteth
he
any
man
:
[God

doesn’t
have
an
evil
conscience
to
tempt
anybody] 

Jas
1
:14 
But
every
man
is
tempted
,
when
he
is
drawn
away
of
his
own

lust
,
and
enticed
.

 […
with
his
bias
towards
an
evil
conscience]

Jas
1
:15 
Then
when
lust
hath
conceived
,
it
bringeth
forth
sin
[and

the
knowledge
of
an
evil
conscience
that
is
amplified
to
hide
the

sin]
:
and
sin
,
when
it
is
finished
,
bringeth
forth
death
.



The
famous
German
philosopher
Friedrich
Nietzsche
said
,
“A
bad
conscience
is
easier
to
cope
with
than
a
bad
reputation
.

” Why
?


Because
a
bad
conscience
is
mostly
contrived
in
secret
,
whereas
a
bad
reputation
is
humiliating
and
mostly
for
everyone
to
see
.


We
are
more
likely
to
fear
another’s
condemnation
rather
than
God’s
since
God
seems
far
off
and
not
in
our
faces
.


It
is
easier
in
the
short
term
to
hide
a
bad
reputation
,
even
with
having
to
live
with
the
amplification
of
an
evil
conscience
forever
.




Pro
9
:10 
The
fear
of
the
LORD
is
the
beginning
of
wisdom
:
and
the

knowledge
of
the
holy
is
understanding
.




Luk
2
:35 
(Yea
,
a
sword
shall
pierce
through
thy
own
soul
also
,)
that

the
thoughts
of
many
hearts
may
be
revealed
.



We
can
accuse
,
excuse
and
run
and
hide
all
we
like
from
an
evil
conscience
but
are
guaranteed
to
face
the
music
of
the
last
Trump
heralding
our
judgment
,
either
in
this
age
or
the
next
.



As
stated
in
the
previous
studies
in
this
series
,
by
being
made
from
the
outset
in
Adam
having
a
trace
of
our
Lord’s
spirit
,
we
know
,
as
Adam
proved
,
a
conscience
when
we
are
disobedient
to
God’s
laws
.


If
we
weren’t
by
default
disobedient
,
we
wouldn’t
have
known
a
good
conscience
.




Gen
3
:4 
And
the
serpent
said
unto
the
woman
,
Ye
shall
not
surely

die
: 

Gen
3
:5 
For
God
doth
know
that
in
the
day
ye
eat
thereof
,
then
your

eyes
shall
be
opened
,
and
ye
shall
be
as
gods
,
knowing
good
and
evil
.



God
gave
us
His
power
to
have
dominion
over
what
we
take
into
our
minds
as
spiritual
food
and
to
learn
not
to
believe
in
the
power
of
the
beast
within
to
pursue
every
‘foul’
spirit
of
doctrine
.


He
says
,


Gen
1
:26 
And
God
said
,
Let
us
make
man
in
our
image
,
after
our

likeness
:
and
let
them
have
dominion
over
the
fish
of
the
sea
,
and

over
the
fowl
of
the
air
,
and
over
the
cattle
,
and
over
all
the
earth
,

and
over
every
creeping
thing
that
creepeth
upon
the
earth
.



In
Gen
1
:26
,
our
Lord
says
parabolically
that
he
will
give
us
first
physical
power
and
later
his
power
,
his
spirit
,
prior
to
being
faced
with
a
fork
in
the
road
of
knowledge
and
thoughts
to
choose
good
or
evil
and
a
resulting
conscience
.



Conclusion

It
is
impossible
to
escape
the
God-given
choice
of
good
and
evil
and
the
corresponding
consciences
.



The
Bride
of
Christ
is
most
grateful
for
her
Lord
making
“all
things”
hers
to
experience
(1Co
3
:22)
,
the
good
equally
with
the
day
of
evil
,
to
cause
both
a
good
and
evil
conscience
to
be
astronomically
impactful
.


There
is
no
escaping
hiding
among
the
trees
and
passing
the
buck
when
discovered
,
only
to
vainly
excuse
ourselves
from
the
evil
that
we
are
since
our
thoughts
already
condemn
us
before
displaying
a
pair
of
bare
butts
bobbing
at
speed
through
the
brush
.




Gen
6
:5 
And
GOD
saw
that
the
wickedness
of
man
was
great
in
the

earth
,
and
that
every
imagination
of
the
thoughts
of
his
heart
was

only
evil
continually
.




Heb
4
:12 
For
the
word
of
God
is
quick
,
and
powerful
,
and
sharper
than

any
twoedged
sword
,
piercing
even
to
the
dividing
asunder
of
soul
and

spirit
,
and
of
the
joints
and
marrow
,
and
is
a
discerner
of
the

thoughts
and
intents
of
the
heart
.




Rev
22
:14 
Blessed
are
they
that
do
his
commandments
,
that
they
may

have
right
to
the
tree
of
life
,
and
may
enter
in
through
the
gates

into
the
city
.



Such
a
person
rightly
divides
the
truth
from
error
.


His
foundation
of
judgment
is
guided
by
the
holy
spirit
of
truth
and
,
with
a
good
conscience
,
condemns
his
warring
evil
conscience

l

If
we
love
lying
,
we
love
our
bias
for
an
evil
conscience
,
one
that
,
in
a
soon-coming
study
,
runs
the
grave
risk
of
a
“seared
conscience”
that
is
impervious
to
a
good
conscience
.




Rev
22
:15 
For
without
are
dogs
,
and
sorcerers
,
and
whoremongers
,
and

murderers
,
and
idolaters
,
and
whosoever
loveth
and
maketh
a
lie
.




Rev
2
:7 
He
that
hath
an
ear
,
let
him
hear
what
the
Spirit
saith
unto

the
churches
;
To
him
that
overcometh
will
I
give
to
eat
of
the
tree
of

life
,
which
is
in
the
midst
of
the
paradise
of
God

What
is
moral
conscience
?


|
|
|
|
Body
.


Discuss
the
role
of
moral
conscience
in
ethical
behaviour
.


|
|
|
|
Conclusion
.


Way
forward
.


|
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

 Moral
conscience is
a
part
of
the
cognitive
process
in
mind
that
tells
whether
an
act
is
morally
right
or
wrong
.


In
other
words
,
it
is
awareness
of
moral
principles
and
whether
act
done
is
in
accordance
with
these
principles
or
not
.


It
is
an
instrument
for
self-control
,
correction
and
regulation
.


The
proper
understanding
of
the
moral
conscience
is
basic
to
our
understanding
of
morality
and
to
an
ethical
conduct
.



Role
of
moral
conscience
in
ethical
behaviour
:

1
.


Right
choices
:
Human
actions
entail
free
decisions
concerning
ends

and
means
.


These
actions
have
an
ethical
dimension
because
they

concern
making
right
choices
based
on
the
analysis
of
the
nature
of

acts
and
the
intentions
and
circumstances
that
are
involved
.


Moral

conscience
help
guide
people
to
follow
the
right
means
to
a
right

end
.


2
.


Inner
guide
:
Moral
conscience
is
our
inner
guide
and
it
helps
you

figure
out
how
to
make
good
choices
.


As
we
grow
up
,
we
learn
right

from
wrong
.


Our
moral
conscience
is
the
thought
and
feeling
we
have

that
tells
us
whether
something
is
a
right
or
wrong
thing
to
do
or

say
.


Thus
it
is
a
consistent
guide
to
ethical
decision
making
.


3
.


Source
of
information
:
The
moral
conscience
is
considered
the

proximate
norm
of
conduct
because
it
is
the
immediate
source
of

information
guiding
human
actions
.


It
directs
human
actions
so
that

a
person
can
transcend
his
animal
instincts
and
human
inclinations
.



Moral
conscience
allows
man
to
exercise
reason
and
thus
allow
an

objective
decision
and
act
based
on
right
values
.


4
.


Decision
making
:
Without
moral
conscience
a
person
would
doubt
even

the
smallest
decisions
.

Since
the
judgment
of
moral
conscience
is
a

judgment
about
how
an
action
conforms
or
does
not
conform
to
natural

law
,
then
,
it
is
obligatory
to
act
according
to
one’s
conscience
.



Although
there
are
persons
who
have
a
doubtful
conscience
which

renders
them
unable
to
decide
upon
actions
easily
.


A
well-formed

moral
conscience
is
effective
because
it
makes
practical
judgments

with
relative
ease
or
after
seeking
necessary
advice
.


5
.


Resolving
ethical
dilemmas
:
A
human
being
always
comes
across

ethical
dilemmas
in
the
decision
making
process
.


Moral
Conscience

acts
as
the
guide
for
taking
correct
decisions
when
we
have
to

choose
between
competing
sets
of
principles
in
a
given
,
usually

undesirable
or
perplexing
,
situation
.


Example
: 
Helping
accident

victims
on
your
way
to
an
interview
.


6
.


Rational
decision
:
Through
our
individual
moral
conscience
,
one

becomes
aware
of
his
deeply
held
moral
principles
,
and
motivates

accordingly
to
act
upon
those
principles
removing
conflicts
.


As
we

assess
our
character
,
our
behaviour
and
ultimately
our
self
against

those
principles
,
conscience
leads
to
proper
analysis
of
good
and

bad
of
the
situation
and
proper
evaluation
of
various
options
.


7
.


Ethical
Awareness
:
This
is
our
ability
to
recognise
ethical
values

and
principles
.


The
moral
conscience
enables
the
human
mind
to

understand
the
world
in
moral
terms
.


This
enhances
our
ability
to

make
practical
decisions
in
light
of
ethical
values
and
principles
.


8
.


Conscientious
Objection
:
The
conscientious
objection
is
very

important
in
public
services
.


Tostay
impartial
,
it
is
important
that

public
servants
must
object
to
any
favours
and
corrupt
activities
.



Moral
conscience
helps
in
conscientious
objection
by
making
an

individual
aware
of
the
impact
of
his
decisions
on
larger
public
.



Limitation
of
moral
conscience
in
ethical
behaviour
:

1
.


Individuality
:
Moral
conscience
is
highly
personal
and
varies
with

individuals
.


For
example
,
a
person
might
think
killing
muslim
as

moral
in
order
to
take
revenge
.


In
his
conscience
it
is
moral
to

kill
muslim
and
help
Hindu
cause
.


2
.


Social
norms
:
Moral
conscience
is
guided
by
the
social
norms
in

general
.


It
can
impact
the
ethical
thinking
of
an
individual
leading

to
unethical
behaviour
.


For
example
,
in
Islamic
countries
many
are

misguided
in
name
of
jihad
and
act
of
terrorism
is
held
moral
and
as

an
act
of
sacrifice
for
the
cause
of
religion
.


3
.


Courage
:
Despite
being
morally
conscience
about
what
is
right
,
an

individual
might
lack
courage
to
act
ethically
.


For
example
,
a
civil

servant
might
know
that
his
colleague
is
taking
bribes
,
he
may
not

act
consciously
due
to
fear
of
political
links
that
his
colleague

has
.


4
.


Other
factors
:
Many
other
factors
like
honesty
,
values
,
education

etc
.


define
an
individual’s
morals
.


Thus
,
one
might
not
know
what
he

is
doing
is
immoral
.


For
example
,
a
person
might
beat
his
wife
as
in

his
conscience
mind
it
is
not
immoral
,
due
to
patriarchal
mindset
.



Thus
the
moral
conscience
plays
an
important
role
in
making
moral
decisions
and
actions
.


The
reason
behind
conscience
as
the
ultimate
,
highest
determiner
of
moral
action
and
its
authority
is
the
idea
that
when
conscience
and
all
other
principles
are
properly
understood
,
they
promote
and
motivate
us
to
act
that
are
in
accordance
with
our
nature
.

Few
novelists
have
captured
the
ultimate
ambiguity
of
conscience
better
than
Mark
Twain
did
in
Huckleberry
Finn
.


Jim
,
the
escaped
slave
who
accompanies
Huck
down
the
river
on
a
raft
,
is
on
a
journey
to
reunite
with
his
beloved
family
(whom
white
people
have
separated
from
him)
.


In
several
scenes
,
Huck
,
beset
with
guilt
for
not
handing
Jim
over
to
the
authorities
as
his
conscience
naggingly
instructs
him
to
,
anguishes
over
his
default
role
as
an
escapee
'
s
accomplice
.



Finally
,
subconsciously
recognizing
Jim
not
only
as
the
devoted
,
concerned
father
figure
he
never
had
but
in
many
ways
as
a
paragon
of
virtue
,
despite
the
color
of
his
skin
,
Huck
decides
to
disobey
his
conscience
.


In
doing
so
,
he
demonstrates
the
courage
many
literary
critics
have
cited
as
constituting
the
novel
'
s
moral
climax
:


I
was
a-trembling
,
because
I
'
d
got
to
decide
,
forever
,
betwixt
two

things
,
and
I
knowed
it
.


I
studied
a
minute
,
sort
of
holding
my

breath
,
and
then
says
to
myself
:
"Alright
then
,
I
'
ll
go
to
hell
.

"

In
addition
,
note
these
two
later
passages
,
which
also
explain
indirectly
why
Twain
would
have
readers
question
the
racist
messages
endemic
to
a
prejudicial
society
:


It
don
'
t
make
no
difference
whether
you
do
right
or
wrong
,
a
person
'
s

conscience
ain
'
t
got
no
sense
,
and
just
goes
for
him
anyway
.



But
because
Huck
isn
'
t
yet
mature
or
free-thinking
enough
to
triumph
over
the
cultural
bias
of
the
culture
that
'
s
"educated"
him
,
he
'
s
compelled
to
rationalize
his
decision
to
protect
Jim
through
some
curious
verbal
gymnastics
,
namely
:


I
knowed
he
[Jim]
was
white
inside
.



To
employ
Freud
'
s
terminology
,
Huck
is
coming
from
his
id
,
doing
what
by
nature
he
'
s
drawn
to
do
while
forcefully
resisting
the
strong
gravitational
pull
of
his
guilt-inducing
superego
.


But
when
these
brief
excerpts
are
explored
in
the
context
of
Twain
'
s
general
handling
of
whites
in
the
novel
,
it
'
s
obvious
that
(as
traditionally
understood)
Twain
has
interchanged
id
and
superego
.



Metaphorically
,
that
is
,
the
connotations
of
whiteness
are
quite
black—and
black
,
ironically
,
has
been
transposed
with
white
.


What
Twain
characterizes
is
that
a
slave
can
exemplify
all
that
'
s
most
admirable
in
humanity
while
the
(purportedly)
most
"lily-white"
individuals
may
indeed
illustrate
the
reverse
.



For
Huck
to
act
"conscientiously
,"
by
denying
Jim
his
personal
freedom—which
,
despite
tremendous
personal
risks
,
Jim
so
desperately
seeks
because
of
his
dedication
to
his
wife
and
children—would
be
to
mirror
his
society
'
s
corrupted
conscience
.


Huck
'
s
safeguarding
of
Jim
from
all
the
people
who
'
d
prefer
(primarily
for
ignoble
reasons)
to
return
him
to
slavery
can
be
comprehended
as
depicting
a
true
versus
an
artificial
,
culturally-derived
conscience
.



Ernest
Hemingway
,
deeply
influenced
by
Twain
'
s
plain-spoken
style
and
exemplifying
a
similar
interest
in
discovering
how
best
to
distinguish
between
virtuous
and
villainous
behavior
,
offers
this
reality-based
solution
in
Death
in
the
Afternoon
:


What
is
moral
is
what
you
feel
good
after
,
and
what
is
immoral
is
what

you
feel
bad
after
.



Here
,
too
,
we
'
re
presented
with
an
idealistically
pragmatic
perspective
deviating
from
the
far
more
conventional
morals
or
mores
of
society
.


Hemingway
'
s
position
is
that
deciding
how
to
evaluate
the
ethical
ramifications
of
behavior
ought
to
be
based
on
personal
,
reality-derived
sentiment
.


It
'
s
a
matter
of
trusting
one
'
s
authentic
feelings
rather
than
what
one
has
absorbed
unconsciously
,
both
from
how
their
family
raised
them
and
the
moral
consensus
of
their
culture
.

Writers
worldwide
have
historically
questioned
popular
assumptions
about
the
fixed
nature
of
good
and
evil
.


So
these
two
authors
can
be
seen
as
representative
of
so
many
writers
who
came
to
regard
accepted
definitions
of
morality
as
simplistic—and
frequently
false
.



Defining
conscience
from
a
religious
perspective

Let
'
s
now
look
at
customary
definitions
of
conscience
to
illustrate
how
they
stop
short
of
accounting
for
the
many
ambiguities
so
often
found
in
reality
,
for
what
'
s
ideal
and
what
'
s
practically
possible
can
at
times
be
worlds
apart—as
can
the
gulf
between
what
people
aspire
to
and
what
they
'
re
actually
capable
of
.



The
literature
online
relating
particularly
to
the
oxymoronic
concept
of
an
evil
conscience
emanates
mostly
from
theology—and
we
'
ll
deal
with
this
orientation
first
.


The
approach
that
fundamentalist
religion
takes
toward
ethics
is
absolutist
,
placing
a
person
'
s
behavior
into
neat
,
generally
unqualified
categories
.


For
example
,
in
a
sermon
marshaling
all
of
its
supporting
evidence
from
Scriptures
,
Greg
Stuckey
defines
any
human
wrongdoing
as—purely
and
simply—evil
.


So
anyone
afflicted
with
such
a
presumed
immoral
conscience
will
experience
as
good
what
the
Bible
delineates
as
evil
,
and
vice
versa
.



Defining
such
people
as
sociopathic
(though
without
employing
this
secular
terminology)
,
Stuckey
posits
that
they
glory
in
and
brag
about
precisely
what
they
should
be
ashamed
of
.


Rather
than
feeling
troubled
by
hurting
others
,
they
perversely
take
joy
in
it
.


Looked
at
from
this
dogmatic
ecclesiastical
stance
,
an
evil
conscience
is
synonymous
with
sinning
against
God—and
it
requires
paying
penance
to
God
if
one
is
to
be
forgiven
.



In
my
next
post
,
I
'
ll
explore
this
seminal
topic
from
a
secular
point
of
view
and
also
explore
the
curious
moral
ambiguity
of
the
superego
.


And
my
final
post
on
this
subject
will
get
into
the
moral
rationalizations
people
offer
for
bad
behavior
which
they
can
'
t—or
won
'
t—own
up
to
.

The
Evil
Conscience


“Let
us
draw
near
with
a
sincere
heart
in
full
assurance
of
faith
,

having
our
hearts
sprinkled
clean
from
an
evil
conscience
and
our

bodies
washed
with
pure
water
.

”


Hebrews
10
:22

How
could
this
be
?


A
conscience
that
is
evil
?


The
traditionalists
are
going
to
faint
when
they
hear
about
this
!


Could
it
be
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
conscience
that
directs
man
to
do
what
is
evil
instead
of
what
is
good
?


Absolutely
.


Just
as
it
is
possible
to
have
a
broken
compass
that
points
east
instead
of
north
.



The
Old
Testament
talks
about
men
whose
hearts
desired
nothing
but
evil
continually
(Genesis
6
:5)
.


These
men
were
later
annihilated
by
the
flood
.


Think
about
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
:
do
you
think
those
guys
were
interested
in
doing
what
was
right
based
on
their
conscience
?


They
were
only
interested
in
sex
with
any
man
or
woman
they
could
find
.


Don’t
be
surprised
,
this
is
what
the
heart
,
mind
and
conscience
of
man
can
degenerate
into
.

 

The
conscience
of
man
can
be
such
that
instead
of
leading
you
to
do
what
is
right
,
it
leads
you
to
do
what
is
evil
.


Again
,
like
the
Seared
Conscience
,
you
can
either
develop
an
evil
conscience
or
be
born
with
it
.


The
difference
between
the
seared
and
evil
conscience
is
that
a
seared
conscience
is
devoid
of
guilt
or
without
regret
from
doing
what
is
wrong
,
or
the
conscience
itself
is
silent
;
an
evil
conscience
,
however
,
directs
the
heart
of
man
towards
evil
instead
of
good
,
doing
the
opposite
of
what
a
normal
,
functioning
conscience
would
do
.

 

In
theory
:
A
good
conscience
keeps
us
from
doing
wrong
because
it
is
a
voice
within
that
directs
us
towards
the
right
action
.



An
evil
conscience
desires
for
us
to
do
what
is
wrong
constantly
,
and
because
of
this
desire
,
there
is
no
guilt
associated
with
committing
whatever
evil
deed
your
heart
desires
.

 

You
would
be
surprised
to
hear
that
such
a
conscience
is
actually
quite
prevalent
in
the
Church
.


Because
it
is
easy
to
do
evil
and
still
walk
into
the
assembly
like
there
is
nothing
wrong
.


This
is
popular
at
highly
liberal
churches
,
which
I
tend
to
call
“Adulterer’s
Haven”
churches
,
because
many
of
them
ignore
the
teachings
of
Christ
on
divorce
and
remarriage
and
allow
anyone
with
an
unscriptural
marriage
to
enter
their
assembly
.

 

An
evil
conscience
will
keep
you
sinning
and
give
you
no
reason
to
change
.


All
the
popular 
tools
of
change
endorsed
by
the
Church
(Guilt/Shame/Conscience/Fear)
have
been
taken
out
of
your
toolbelt
.


According
to
them
,
you
will
not
be
able
to
progress
.


Without
an
overwhelming
sense
of
guilt
,
how
will
you
change
?

 

This
statement
gives
you
a
bird’s
eye
view
into
their
ignorance
of
the
subject
.


No
emotion
is
necessary
for
change
to
occur
,
even
though
emotions
can
help
on
the
path
of
change
.


However
,
guilt
is
uncommon
for
men
,
as
it
tends
to
be
primarily
a
female
emotion
or
one
experienced
by
weak
beta-males
.

 

Men
,
you
must
grow
,
train
,
progress
and
improve
with
or
without
emotional
help
.



Few
modern
men
know
this
.


You
aren’t
going
to
feel
like
going
to
work
every
day
,
no
one
does
,
but
you
go
anyway
.


No
one
is
going
to
feel
like
working
out
every
day
,
but
you
do
it
anyways
.


No
man
is
going

to
and
loving
their
wife
every
day
,
but
they
do
it
.



Men
take
action
regardless
of
how
they
feel
at
the
time
.


Regardless
of
all
emotion
,
men
must
press
on
and
do
what
is
right
.


They
must
work
,
improve
,
train
and
move
towards
being
the
fully
formed
and
functional
men
they
need
to
be
.


Reject
the
weak
man’s
idea
of
conscience
,
embrace
the
rigid
strength
of
discipline
unaltered
by
feeling
.



Mantra

Reject
conscience
,
embrace
action
.

 

[evil
conscience]

Application

If
you
have
an
evil
conscience
,
you
must
do
the
opposite
of
what
your
conscience
tells
you
to
do
.


It
is
as
simple
as
that
.


If
your
conscience
is
evil
,
it
is
pulling
you
towards
evil
action
,
so
you
must
resist
your
conscience
and
oppose
it
in
order
to
do
what
is
right
.


Again
,
it
does
not
matter
if
you
feel
like
doing
what
is
right
,
or
if
you
want
to
,
or
what
your
motivation
is
,
it
only
matters
if
you
do
what
is
right
or
not
.


What
are
your
actions
?


They
can
be
good
or
evil
regardless
of
what
kind
of
conscience
you
have
.

 

Again
,
and
at
risk
of
being
overly
redundant
,
reject
the
idea
of
the
necessity
of
conscience
.

 

Conscience
is
a
tool
to
be
used
for
change
,
but
change
is
possible
without
this
tool
.


This
is
a
principle
fact
of
life
.


You
must
do
what
is
right
regardless
of
emotional
states
,
including
the
emotional
state
of
a
conscience
.


You
must
focus
and
take
action
.


Do
what
is
right
.


Be
a
Man
.



Conduct
Yourselves
Like
Men
.

GUILTY
CONSCIENCE/BAD
CONSCIENCE

[]

[]

Guilt
or
guilty
conscience
is
one
of
the
most
common
negative
or
sad
emotions
that
people
experience
almost
every
day
.


If
not
addressed
properly
,
a
guilty
conscience
can
destroy
your
relationship
,
steal
your
joy
,
your
happiness
,
and
even
your
future
.


Yet
,
the
majority
of
us
don
'
t
know
how
to
deal
with
it
in
a
healthy
way
.


According
to
the
German
philosopher
,
Friedrich
Nietzsche
(1844
-
1900)
.


A
guilty
conscience
can
push
a
person
to
become
very
cruel
and
do
horrible
things
as
a
result
.


Horrible
things
like
killing
,
committing
suicide
,
etc
.


Yet
,
just
like
any
other
emotions
,
there
'
s
not
a
clear
definition
for
a
"guilty
conscience"
.


So
to
better
understand
what
it
is
,
one
has
to
explore
the
concept
of
right
and
wrong
within
society
.



In
psychology
,
for
Sigmund
Freud
guilt
resides
under
the
surface
veneer
of
a
person
'
s
behavior
(1856
-
1939)
.


With
that
says
,
guilt
is
a
self-conscious
emotion
that
signals
a
person
when
his/her
actions
or
behaviors
may
have
caused
or
will
cause
harm
to
others
either
physically
,
emotionally
or
both
.


So
to
feel
guilty
is
to
feel
painful
regret
for
something
wrong
one
thinks
he/she
might
have
done
.



Why
Feeling
Guilty
is
important
?



Last
week
I
wrote
about
Psychological
Deflection
and
the
major
role
our
ego
plays
in
it
.


In
that
article
,
I
said
that
our
ego
builds
a
self-defense
system
designed
to
protect
us
from
feeling
guilty
or
remorseful
for
our
bad
behaviors
or
actions
in
order
to
keep
our
self-esteem
,
self-worth
,
etc
intact
.


.


.

I
further
said
that
over
time
,
that
same
self-defense
system
will
start
having
negative
effects
on
our
self-image
and
the
way
we
view
the
world
.


This
means
no
one
can
buy
himself/herself
a
"get-out-jail-free
card"
in
this
universe
.


To
maintain
emotional
and
psychological
balance
,
it
is
necessary
to
experience
guilt
for
our
bad
behavior
or
actions
.


Besides
,
a
guilty
conscience
is
like
having
a
snooze
alarm
in
your
head
that
won
'
t
shut
off
until
it
is
addressed
and
it
has
to
be
addressed
in
a
healthy
way
.



If
not
addressed
properly
,
a
guilty
conscience
will
make
it
very
hard
for
you
to
think
straight
and
make
the
right
decisions
when
necessary
,
a
guilty
conscience
can
also
trigger
shame
,
anger
,
emptiness
,
and
in
many
cases
,
sabotage
your
entire
life
and
your
relationship
with
others
.



A
guilty
conscience
that
is
not
addressed
properly
will
also
make
you
become
very
paranoid
and
delusional
.


For
example
;
a
guilty
conscience
may
make
you
feel
that
everything
people
say
or
write
in
their
social
media
pages
is
about
you
and
then
consider
it
as
a
personal
attack
against
,
therefore
,
you
feel
the
urgency
to
respond
to
them
defensively
.


Such
behavior
will
eventually
throw
you
off
balance
emotionally
and
psychologically
and
make
you
a
good
candidate
for
anxiety
,
depression
,
or
much
worse
.


A
guilty
conscience
can
also
make
you
hate
and
punish
yourself
,
avoid
hearing
nor
seeing
the
person
that
you
'
ve
wronged
,
it
will
also
push
you
to
talk
negatively
about
that
person
in
order
to
justify
your
bad
behavior
or
actions
,
and
in
many
cases
,
it
can
even
make
you
feel
resentful
towards
him/her
because
every
time
you
hear
or
see
him/her
it
reminds
you
what
you
have
done
.



Guilt
can
also
make
you
hate
that
person
you
'
ve
wronged
and
try
to
do
more
harm
to
him/her
should
you
get
the
opportunity
.



How
to
Effectively
Deal
with
a
Guilty
Conscience
?



1)
The
first
step
in
dealing
with
a
guilty
conscience
is
always
to
surrender
to
the
truth
(Repentance)
.


This
means
to
stop
fighting
or
denying
your
guilt
because
the
more
you
deny
it
the
more
intense
the
pain
will
become
.


Never
deny
your
guilt
nor
try
to
blame
it
on
someone
else
because
,
as
I
'
ve
said
before
,
no
one
can
buy
himself/herself
a
get-out-jail-free
card
in
this
universe
.


This
means
denying
your
guilt
will
have
other
effects
.


2)
The
second
step
is
to
stop
punishing
yourself
.


Understand
that
no
one
is
perfect
including
you
,
which
leaves
the
avenue
of
life
wide
open
before
you
to
make
plenty
of
mistakes
.


So
own
your
mistakes
and
learn
from
them
.


If
you
'
re
in
an
environment
where
you
feel
like
you
'
re
constantly
being
judged
,
remove
yourself
from
that
environment
as
soon
as
you
can
.



3)
The
third
step
in
dealing
with
a
guilty
conscience
is
to
keep
your
emotions
and
behavior
in
check
at
all
time
.


There
'
s
nothing
more
embarrassing
for
a
person
than
not
being
unable
to
control
his/her
emotions
or
behavior
.


Such
a
person
can
easily
snap
at
others
for
no
justifiable
reason
(s)
and
it
does
not
look
good
at
all
.


4)
The
fourth
step
is
forgiveness
and
this
is
very
,
very
important
.


Through
my
personal
and
professional
experience
,
I
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
hardest
part
of
forgiveness
is
not
forgiving
someone
who
'
ve
wronged
you
,
it
is
forgiving
ourselves
,
in
other
words
,
self-forgiveness
.


But
here
'
s
the
thing
,
to
take
that
pressure
off
your
back
,
to
enjoy
life
once
again
,
to
build
high
self-esteem
and
confidence
in
oneself
,
self-forgiveness
is
vital
.


So
seek
forgiveness
from
the
person
you
'
ve
wronged
,
forgive
yourself
,
and
then
let
it
go
.



5)
The
fifth
step
is
to
focus
on
the
"now"
,
rather
than
the
past
.


I
often
hear
people
said
to
others
that
they
can
'
t
live
in
the
past
or
repeat
the
past
.


Whenever
I
hear
that
I
smile
because
it
'
s
easier
said
than
done
.


In
fact
,
the
majority
of
us
are
actually
living
in
the
past
emotionally
and
psychologically
.


And
the
sad
thing
is
,
they
'
re
not
even
aware
of
it
.


If
you
don
'
t
own
your
past
,
in
other
words
,
take
responsibility
and
be
mindful
about
it
,
I
can
tell
you
right
now
that
your
life
is
on
a
repeat
mode
and
there
'
s
not
much
difference
between
your
past
and
your
current
situation
.


This
means
,
your
past
keeps
repeating
itself
in
your
present
and
if
you
don
'
t
change
your
way
of
doing
things
it
will
repeat
itself
in
your
future
also
.


6)
The
sixth
and
final
step
is
to
always
seek
professional
help
(psychologist)
if
feel
like
you
'
re
overwhelmed
by
a
guilty
conscience
because
it
can
lead
to
more
severe
emotional
or
psychological
situations
,
even
suicide
.

Class
consciousness
is
a
term
used
in
political
theory
,
particularly
Marxism
,
to
refer
to
the
beliefs
that
a
person
holds
regarding
their
social
class
or
economic
rank
in
society
,
the
structure
of
their
class
,
and
their
class
interests
.


It
is
an
awareness
that
is
key
to
sparking
a
revolution
that
would
,
"create
a
dictatorship
of
the
proletariat
,
transforming
it
from
a
wage-earning
,
property-less
mass
into
the
ruling
class"
according
to
Karl
Marx
.

Marxist
theory

While
German
theorist
Karl
Marx
rarely
used
the
term
"class
consciousness"
,
he
did
make
the
distinction
between
"class
in
itself"
,
which
is
defined
as
a
category
of
people
having
a
common
relation
to
the
means
of
production
,
and
a
"class
for
itself"
,
which
is
defined
as
a
stratum
organized
in
active
pursuit
of
its
own
interests
.



Defining
a
person
'
s
social
class
can
be
a
determinant
for
their
awareness
of
it
.


Marxists
define
classes
on
the
basis
of
their
relation
to
the
means
of
production
–
especially
on
whether
they
own
capital
.


Non-Marxist
social
scientists
distinguish
various
social
strata
on
the
basis
of
income
,
occupation
,
or
status
.



Early
in
the
nineteenth
century
,
the
labels
"working
classes"
and
"middle
classes"
were
already
coming
into
common
usage
.


"The
old
hereditary
aristocracy
,
reinforced
by
the
new
gentry
who
owed
their
success
to
commerce
,
industry
,
and
the
professions
,
evolved
into
an
"upper
class"
.


Its
consciousness
was
formed
in
part
by
public
schools
(in
the
British
sense)
and
Universities
.


The
upper
class
tenaciously
maintained
control
over
the
political
system
,
depriving
not
only
the
working
classes
but
the
middle
classes
of
a
voice
in
the
political
process
.

Georg
Lukács
'

History
and
Class
Consciousness
(1923)

Class
consciousness
,
as
described
by
Georg
Lukács
'
s
famous
History
and
Class
Consciousness
(1923)
,
is
opposed
to
any
psychological
conception
of
consciousness
,
which
forms
the
basis
of
individual
or
mass
psychology
(see
Freud
or
,
before
him
,
Gustave
Le
Bon)
.


According
to
Lukács
,
each
social
class
has
a
determined
class
consciousness
which
it
can
achieve
.


In
effect
,
as
opposed
to
the
liberal
conception
of
consciousness
as
the
basis
of
individual
freedom
and
of
the
social
contract
,
Marxist
class
consciousness
is
not
an
origin
,
but
an
achievement
(i
.

e
.


it
must
be
"earned"
or
won)
.


Hence
,
it
is
never
assured
:
the
proletariat
'
s
class
consciousness
is
the
result
of
a
permanent
struggle
to
understand
the
"concrete
totality"
of
the
historical
process
.



According
to
Lukács
,
the
proletariat
was
the
first
class
in
history
that
may
achieve
true
class
consciousness
,
because
of
its
specific
position
highlighted
in
the
Communist
Manifesto
as
the
"living
negation"
of
capitalism
.


All
others
classes
,
including
the
bourgeoisie
,
are
limited
to
a
"false
consciousness"
which
impedes
them
from
understanding
the
totality
of
history
:
instead
of
understanding
each
specific
moment
as
a
portion
of
a
supposedly
deterministic
historical
process
,
they
universalize
it
and
believe
it
is
everlasting
.


Hence
,
capitalism
is
not
thought
as
a
specific
phase
of
history
,
but
is
naturalized
and
thought
of
as
an
eternal
solidified
part
of
history
.


Says
Lukács
,
this
"false
consciousness"
,
which
forms
ideology
itself
,
is
not
a
simple
error
as
in
classical
philosophy
,
but
an
illusion
which
cannot
be
dispelled
.



Marx
described
it
in
his
theory
of
commodity
fetishism
,
which
Lukács
completed
with
his
concept
of
reification
:
alienation
is
what
follows
the
worker
'
s
estrangement
to
the
world
following
the
new
life
acquired
by
the
product
of
his
work
.


The
dominant
bourgeois
ideology
thus
leads
the
individual
to
see
the
achievement
of
his
labour
take
a
life
of
its
own
.


Furthermore
,
specialization
is
also
seen
as
a
characteristic
of
the
ideology
of
modern
rationalism
,
which
creates
specific
and
independent
domains
(art
,
politics
,
science
,
etc
.

)
.


Only
a
global
perspective
can
point
out
how
all
these
different
domains
interact
,
argues
Lukács
.


He
also
points
out
how
Kant
brought
to
its
limit
the
classical
opposition
between
the
abstract
form
and
the
concrete
,
historical
content
,
which
is
abstractly
conceived
as
irrational
and
contingent
.


Thus
,
with
Kant
'
s
rational
system
,
history
becomes
totally
contingent
and
is
thus
ignored
.


Only
with
Hegel
'
s
dialectic
can
a
mediation
be
found
between
the
abstract
form
and
the
abstract
notion
of
a
concrete
content
.



Even
if
the
bourgeois
loses
his
individual
point
of
view
in
an
attempt
to
grasp
the
reality
of
the
totality
of
society
and
of
the
historical
process
,
he
is
condemned
to
a
form
of
false
consciousness
.


As
an
individual
,
he
will
always
see
the
collective
result
of
individual
actions
as
a
form
of
"objective
law"
to
which
he
must
submit
himself
(liberalism
has
gone
so
far
as
seeing
an
invisible
hand
in
this
collective
results
,
making
capitalism
the
best
of
all
possible
worlds)
.


By
contrast
,
the
proletariat
would
be
,
according
to
Lukács
,
the
first
class
in
history
with
the
possibility
to
achieve
a
true
form
of
class
consciousness
,
granting
it
knowledge
of
the
totality
of
the
historical
process
.



The
proletariat
takes
the
place
of
Hegel
'
s
Weltgeist
("World
Spirit")
,
which
achieves
history
through
Volksgeist
("the
spirit
of
the
people")
:
the
idealist
conception
of
an
abstract
Spirit
making
history
,
which
ends
in
the
realm
of
Reason
,
is
replaced
by
a
materialist
conception
based
not
on
mythical
Spirits
,
but
on
a
concrete
"identical
subject-object
of
history"
:
the
proletariat
.


The
proletariat
is
both
the
"object"
of
history
,
created
by
the
capitalist
social
formation
;
but
it
is
also
the
"subject"
of
history
,
as
it
is
its
labour
that
shapes
the
world
,
and
thus
,
knowledge
of
itself
is
also
,
necessarily
,
knowledge
of
the
reality
and
of
the
totality
of
the
historical
process
.


The
proletariat
'
s
class
consciousness
is
not
immediate
;
class
consciousness
must
not
be
mistaken
either
with
the
consciousness
of
one
'
s
future
and
collective
interests
,
opposed
to
personal
immediate
interests
.



The
possibility
of
class
consciousness
is
given
by
the
objective
process
of
history
,
which
transforms
the
proletariat
into
a
commodity
,
hence
objectifying
it
.


Class
consciousness
is
thus
not
a
simple
subjective
act
:
"as
consciousness
here
is
not
the
consciousness
of
an
object
opposed
to
itself
,
but
the
object
'
s
consciousness
,
the
act
of
being
conscious
of
oneself
disrupts
the
objectivity
form
of
its
object"
(in
"Reification
and
the
Proletariat
'
s
Consciousness"
§3
,
III
"The
proletariat
'
s
point
of
view")
.


In
other
words
,
instead
of
the
bourgeois
subject
and
its
corresponding
ideological
concept
of
individual
free
will
,
the
proletariat
has
been
transformed
into
an
object
(a
commodity)
which
,
when
it
takes
consciousness
of
itself
,
transforms
the
very
structure
of
objectivity
,
that
is
of
reality
.



This
specific
role
of
the
proletariat
is
a
consequence
of
its
specific
position
;
thus
,
for
the
first
time
,
consciousness
of
itself
(class
consciousness)
is
also
consciousness
of
the
totality
(knowledge
of
the
entire
social
and
historical
process)
.


Through
dialectical
materialism
,
the
proletariat
understands
that
what
the
individual
bourgeois
conceived
as
"laws"
akin
to
the
laws
of
nature
,
which
may
be
only
manipulated
,
as
in
Descartes
'
s
dream
,
but
not
changed
,
is
in
fact
the
result
of
a
social
and
historical
process
,
which
can
be
controlled
.


Furthermore
,
only
dialectical
materialism
links
together
all
specialized
domains
,
which
modern
rationalism
can
only
think
as
separate
instead
of
as
forming
a
totality
.



Only
the
proletariat
can
understand
that
the
so-called
"eternal
laws
of
economics"
are
in
fact
nothing
more
than
the
historical
form
taken
by
the
social
and
economical
process
in
a
capitalist
society
.


Since
these
"laws"
are
the
result
of
the
collective
actions
of
individuals
,
and
are
thus
created
by
society
,
Marx
and
Lukács
reasoned
that
this
necessarily
meant
that
they
could
be
changed
.


Any
attempt
in
transforming
the
so-called
"laws"
governing
capitalism
into
universal
principles
,
valid
in
all
times
and
places
,
are
criticized
by
Lukács
as
a
form
of
false
consciousness
.



As
the
"expression
of
the
revolutionary
process
itself"
,
dialectical
materialism
,
which
is
the
only
theory
with
an
understanding
of
the
totality
of
the
historical
process
,
is
the
theory
which
may
help
the
proletariat
in
its
"struggle
for
class
consciousness"
.


Although
Lukács
does
not
contest
the
Marxist
primacy
of
the
economic
base
on
the
ideological
superstructure
(not
to
be
mistaken
with
vulgar
economic
determinism)
,
he
considers
that
there
is
a
place
for
autonomous
struggle
for
class
consciousness
.



In
order
to
achieve
a
unity
of
theory
and
praxis
,
theory
must
not
only
tend
toward
reality
in
an
attempt
to
change
it
;
reality
must
also
tend
towards
theory
.


Otherwise
,
the
historical
process
leads
a
life
of
its
own
,
while
theorists
make
their
own
little
theories
,
desperately
waiting
for
some
kind
of
possible
influence
over
the
historical
process
.


Henceforth
,
reality
itself
must
tend
toward
the
theory
,
making
it
the
"expression
of
the
revolutionary
process
itself"
.


In
turn
,
a
theory
which
has
as
its
goal
helping
the
proletariat
achieve
class
consciousness
must
first
be
an
"objective
theory
of
class
consciousness"
.


However
,
theory
in
itself
is
insufficient
,
and
ultimately
relies
on
the
struggle
of
humankind
and
of
the
proletariat
for
consciousness
:
the
"objective
theory
of
class
consciousness
is
only
the
theory
of
its
objective
possibility"
.



[edit]

Criticism

Economist
Ludwig
Von
Mises
argued
that
"Marx
confus[ed]
the
notions
of
caste
and
class"
.


Mises
allowed
that
class
consciousness
,
and
the
associated
class
struggle
,
were
valid
concepts
in
some
circumstances
where
rigid
social
castes
exist
;
e
.

g
.


,
when
slavery
is
legal
,
and
slaves
thus
share
a
common
motive
for
ending
their
disadvantaged
status
relative
to
other
castes
.


"But
no
such
conflicts
are
present
in
a
society
in
which
all
citizens
are
equal
before
the
law
,"
according
to
Mises
.


"No
logical
objection
can
be
advanced
against
distinguishing
various
classes
among
the
members
of
such
a
society
.


Any
classification
is
logically
permissible
,
however
arbitrarily
the
mark
of
distinction
may
be
chosen
.


But
it
is
nonsensical
to
classify
the
members
of
a
capitalistic
society
according
to
their
position
in
the
framework
of
the
social
division
of
labor
and
then
to
identify
these
classes
with
the
castes
of
a
status
society
.

"

Philosopher
Leszek
Kołakowski
argued
that
the
"theory
of
class
consciousness
is
false"
and
that
attempts
by
Marxist–Leninists
to
advance
the
concept
of
class
consciousness
necessarily
led
to
totalitarianism
.



Sociologist
Ernest
van
den
Haag
has
argued
:

One
way
is
to
say
that
"objectively"
people
have
common
class
interests
and
should
act
according
to
the
class
struggle
pattern
—
but
that
they
are
not
always
"class
conscious"
.


They
suffer
from
"false
consciousness"
.


But
this
is
(a)
not
true
;
nor
would
it
(b)
help
much
if
it
were
.



a)
There
often
are
conflicts
among
objective
economic
interests
within
a
Marxian
class
—
e
.

g
.


among
workers
.


Conflicts
occur
over
migration
,
international
trade
,
religion
or
race
.


And
workers
often
have
objective
interests
in
common
with
capitalists
and
in
conflict
with
the
interests
of
other
groups
of
workers
.


Class
membership
is
no
more
and
possibly
less
decisive
than
say
race
membership
in
determining
one
'
s
political
views
.


If
you
insist
on
the
importance
of
race
,
you
may
persuade
people
to
act
according
to
their
"racial
interests"
for
a
while
—
as
the
Nazis
did
.


If
you
convince
people
that
they
should
act
according
to
what
you
tell
them
are
your
class
interests
,
they
might
.


The
prophecy
becomes
self-fulfilling
.


But
the
action
comes
from
race
or
class
propaganda
—
not
from
race
or
class
as
objective
facts
.



b)
Further
if
we
assume
that
classes
are
as
important
as
Marx
thought
but
that
people
do
not
act
accordingly
,
because
not
having
read
Marx
,
they
are
not
class
conscious
–
if
"class
consciousness"
becomes
independent
of
class
membership
—
and
if
class
membership
is
neither
sufficient
nor
necessary
to
bring
the
expected
class
behaviour
,
then
social
classes
become
one
of
many
groups
that
influence
man
'
s
action
on
some
occasions
.


This
would
be
a
correct
theory
.


But
the
distinctive
point
of
Marxian
theory
is
that
class
membership
is
decisive
in
determining
most
and
particularly
political
actions
.


This
is
patently
wrong
.

Ethics
Explainer
:
Conscience

ExplainerRelationships

BY
The
Ethics
Centre
17
NOV
2017

Conscience
describes
two
things
–
what
a
person
believes
is
right
and
how
a
person
decides
what
is
right
.


More
than
just
‘gut
instinct’
,
our
conscience
is
a
‘moral
muscle’
.



By
informing
us
of
our values
and
principles
,
it
becomes
the
standard
we
use
to
judge
whether
or
not
our
actions
are
ethical
.



We
can
call
these
two
roles
ethical
awareness
and
ethical
decision
making
.



Ethical
Awareness

This
is
our
ability
to
recognise
ethical
values
and
principles
.



The
medieval
philosopher Thomas
Aquinas believed
our
conscience
emerged
from synderesis
:
the
‘spark
of
conscience’
.


He
literally
meant
the
human
mind’s
ability
to
understand
the
world
in
moral
terms
.


Conscience
was
the
process
by
which
a
person
brought
the
principles
of synderesis into
a
practical
situation
through
our
decisions
.



Ethical
Decision
Making

This
is
our
ability
to
make
practical
decisions
informed
by
ethical
values
and
principles
.



In
his
writings
,
Aristotle
described phronesis
:
the
goodness
of
practical
reason
.


This
was
the
ability
to
evaluate
a
situation
clearly
so
we
would
know
how
to
act
virtuously
under
the
circumstances
.



A
conscience
which
is
both
well
formed
(shaped
by
education
and
experience)
and
well
informed
(aware
of
facts
,
evidence
and
so
on)
enables
us
to
know
ourselves
and
our
world
and
act
accordingly
.



Seeing
conscience
in
this
way
is
important
because
it
teaches
us
ethics
is
not
innate
.


By
continuously
working
to
understand
our
surroundings
,
we
strengthen
our
moral
muscle
.



Conscientious
Objection

In
politics
,
much
of
the
debate
around
conscience
concerns
the “right
to conscientious
objection”
.



-
Should
pro-life
doctors
be
required
to
perform
abortions
or
refer

patients
to
doctors
who
will
?


-
Must
priests
break
the
confessional
seal
and
report
sex
offenders

who
confess
to
them
?


-
Can
pacifists
be
excused
from
conscription
because
of
their

opposition
to
war
?



For
a
long
time
,
Western
nations
,
informed
by
the
Catholic
intellectual
tradition
,
believed
in
the
“primacy
of
conscience”
–
the
idea
that
a
person
should
never
be
forced
to
do
something
they
believe
is
against
their
most
deeply
held
values
and
principles
.



In
recent
times
,
particularly
in
medicine
,
this
has
come
to
be
questioned
.


Australian
bioethicist Julian
Savulescu believes
doctors
working
in
the
public
system
should
be banned
from
objecting to
procedures
because
it
compromises
patient
care
.



This
debate
sees
a
clash
between
two
worldviews
–
one
where
people’s
foremost
responsibility
is
to
their
own
personal
beliefs
about
what
is
good
and
right
and
another
where
this
duty
is
balanced
against
the
needs
of
the
common
good
.



Philosopher Michael
Walzer believes
there
are
situations
where
you
have
a
duty
to
“get
your
hands
dirty”
–
even
if
the
price
is
your
own
sense
of
goodness
.


In
response
,
Aristotle
might
have
said
,
“no
person
wishes
to
possess
the
world
if
they
must
first
become
someone
else”
.


That
is
,
we
can’t
change
who
we
are
or
what
we
believe
in
for
any
price
.

Ethics

Religious
views
on
conscience

Aquinas’
Natural
moral
law

Aquinas
developed
Natural
law
as
a
form
of
religious
ethics
.


Natural
law
is
the
theory
that
God
has
designed
a
moral
law
into
human
nature
such
that
we
are
naturally
inclined
to
certain
moral
behaviours
.


Ethics
is
therefore
about
using
reason
to
discover
the
natural
law
within
our
nature
so
that
we
can
conform
our
actions
to
it
in
order
to
fulfil
our
purpose
(telos)
of
glorifying
God
,
by
following
his
law
.



The
Primary
Precepts
&
Synderesis

Aquinas
claims
that
reason
is
a
power
of
the
human
soul
and
synderesis
is
the
habit
or
ability
of
reason
to
discover
foundational
‘first
principles’
of
God’s
natural
moral
law
which
gives
us
insight
into
God’s
intentions
for
human
life
and
thus
our
telos
.



“the
first
practical
principles
…
[belong
to]
a
special
natural
habit
…
which
we
call
“synderesis”
…
is
said
to
incite
to
good
,
and
to
murmur
at
evil
,
inasmuch
as
through
first
principles
we
proceed
to
discover
,
and
judge
of
what
we
have
discovered
.

”

The
first
principle
synderesis
tells
us
is
called
the
synderesis
rule
:
that
the
good
is
what
all
things
seek
as
their
end/goal
(telos)
.


This
means
that
human
nature
has
an
innate
orientation
to
the
good
.



“This
therefore
is
the
principle
of
law
:
that
good
must
be
done
and
evil
avoided
.

”

In
addition
to
this
,
synderesis
tells
us
the
primary
precepts
:
worship
God
,
live
in
an
orderly
society
,
reproduce
,
educate
,
protect
and
preserve
human
life
and
defend
the
innocent
.


These
primary
precepts
are
the
articulation
of
the
orientations
in
our
nature
toward
the
good
;
the
natural
inclinations
of
our
God-designed
human
nature
,
put
into
the
form
of
ethical
principles
by
human
reason
.



Secondary
precepts
&
conscientia

The
primary
precepts
are
applied
to
situations
or
types
of
actions
–
a
process
called
conscientia
.


The
judgement
we
then
acquire
is
a
secondary
precept
.


E
.

g
euthanasia
:
the
primary
precepts
don’t
say
anything
about
euthanasia
exactly
,
but
we
can
use
our
reason
to
apply
the
primary
precepts
to
euthanasia
,
and
realise
that
it
goes
against
the
primary
precept
of
protecting
and
preserving
human
life
.


Arguably
it
even
disrupts
the
functioning
of
society
too
.


Therefore
,
we
can
conclude
the
secondary
precept
that
euthanasia
is
wrong
.



Aquinas’
view
of
the
conscience

Natural
law
is
Aquinas’
theory
on
how
God
is
the
grounding
and
source
of
morality
.


Conscience
is
about
the
human
psychology
involved
in
understanding
and
applying
natural
moral
law
.


Conscience
is
ratio
(reason)
used
to
understand
and
apply
God’s
natural
law
.



Aquinas
claims
that
the
classic
features
of
conscience
follow
from
the
application
of
our
knowledge
of
the
natural
moral
law
to
our
moral
actions
,
in
three
ways
:

1
.


Witness
–
by
knowing
whether
we
have
done
or
not
done
something
.


2
.


Bind
&
incite
–
“through
the
conscience
we
judge
that
something

should
be
done
or
not
done”
3
.


Accuse
,
torment
&
rebuke
–
“by
conscience
we
judge
that
something

done
is
well
done
or
ill
done”

This
is
how
the
conscience
causes
guilt
.


Conscience
is
our
ability
to
know
whether
we
have
done
something
,
whether
we
should
have
done
it
,
and
whether
it
was
done
well
.


If
we
have
done
something
wrong
,
our
conscience
will
accuse
,
torment
and
rebuke
us
–
causing
feelings
of
guilt
.



Because
human
reason
is
fallible
,
the
conscience
thereby
becomes
fallible
.


We
could
be
mistaken
for
example
when
we
don’t know
how
a
general
rule
applies
to
a
certain
situation
(mistake
in
conscientia)
.


Aquinas
claims
that
the
synderesis
rule
and
the
primary
precepts
cannot
be
mistaken
or
lost
from
the
human
mind
.


However
,
mistakes
can
be
made
in
conscientia
–
the
application
of
the
primary
precepts
to
moral
situations
or
actions
to
derive
secondary
precepts
.


These
mistakes
can
result
from
original
sin
,
unvirtuous
habits
and
corrupt
culture
.



“As
to
those
general
principles
,
the
natural
law
,
in
the
abstract
,
can
nowise
be
blotted
out
from
men’s
hearts
.


[…]
But
as
to
[…]
the
secondary
precepts
,
the
natural
law
can
be
blotted
out
from
the
human
heart
,
either
by
evil
persuasions
,
just
as
in
speculative
matters
errors
occur
in
respect
of
necessary
conclusions
;
or
by
vicious
customs
and
corrupt
habits”

Real
vs
apparent
goods
.


We
might
reason
that
something
is
in
accord
with
our
nature’s
goal
and
is
thus
good
,
when
really
is
not
.


Such
actions
are
called
apparent
goods
because
they
only
appear
good
to
someone
engaged
in
faulty
reasoning
.


They
are
not
real
goods
.


Despite
this
potential
for
our
conscience
judging
something
bad
to
be
good
,
Aquinas
still
insists
we
must
follow
it
:

“Every
judgment
of
conscience
,
be
it
right
or
wrong
…
is
obligatory
…
he
who
acts
against
his
conscience
always
sins”

This
is
because
if
you
choose
to
act
against
your
conscience
,
then
you
are
choosing
to
do
something
you
believe
to
be
evil
.


Conscience
is
thus
always
‘binding’
.



Vincible
vs
invincible
ignorance

Whether
errors
in
conscience
that
lead
to
sinful
acts
will
be
forgiven
or
pardoned
depends
on
the
type
of
ignorance
that
caused
the
error
.



Invincible
ignorance
involves
circumstances
where
a
person
could
not
have
known
better
and
so
are
not
to
blame
for
their
action
.


For
example
if
someone
drunkenly
jumps
in
front
of
your
car
and
there
was
nothing
you
could
have
done
,
you
would
not
be
held
responsible
for
hitting
them
.


Actions
that
go
against
the
natural
law
but
are
done
due
to
invincible
ignorance
are
technically
not
voluntary
and
thus
not
sin
.



“It
is
not
imputed
as
a
sin
to
man
,
if
he
fails
to
know
what
he
is
unable
to
know
.


Consequently
ignorance
of
such
like
things
is
called
‘invincible’”

Vincible
ignorance
involves
circumstances
where
a
person
could
have
known
better
and
so
are
to
blame
for
their
action
.


It
typically
involves
some
kind
of
negligence
or
ignorance
of
which
moral
principle
is
relevant
to
a
situation
.


For
example
,
if
a
fire
breaks
out
in
a
building
because
it
wasn’t
looked
after
properly
,
then
the
person
in
charge
of
that
is
to
blame
for
their
action
.


They
were
ignorant
that
the
fire
would
happen
,
but
they
should
have
known
better
.


Actions
that
go
against
the
natural
law
done
out
of
vincible
ignorance
are
sins
because
we
should
have
known
better
.



“[invincible
ignorance]
not
being
voluntary
,
since
it
is
not
in
our
power
to
be
rid
of
it
,
is
not
a
sin
…
On
the
other
hand
,
vincible
ignorance
is
a
sin
,
if
it
be
about
matters
one
is
bound
to
know
.

”

Arguably
Aquinas
is
too
optimistic
about
human
nature
.


If
you
consider
the
terrible
things
that
humans
have
done
and
that
entire
cultures
have
embraced
,
e
.

g
.


slavery
and
Nazism
,
it
starts
to
look
like
human
nature
is
not
as
positive
as
Aquinas
thought
.


If
we
really
had
an
orientation
towards
the
good
and
the
primary
precepts
accurately
described
our
nature’s
orientation
,
then
we
should
not
expect
to
find
the
extent
of
human
evil
we
do
.



However
,
Aquinas’
claim
is
merely
that
human
nature
contains
an
orientation
towards
the
good
,
it
doesn’t
involve
a
commitment
to
humans
actually
doing
more
good
than
evil
,
nor
to
incredibly
evil
acts
or
cultures
occurring
infrequently
.


Aquinas
acknowledges
that
there
are
many
reasons
we
might
fail
to
do
good
despite
having
an
orientation
towards
it
.


These
include
original
sin
,
mistakes
in
conscientia
,
lacking
virtue
and
a
corrupt
culture
.



The
fact
that
humanity
could
sink
so
low
as
to
produce
Nazism
and
the
holocaust
is
strong
evidence
against
the
human
nature
having
an
orientation
toward
the
good
.



Descriptive
moral
relativism

Aquinas
was
not
as
aware
of
different
cultures
as
we
are
today
.


As
we
now
know
thanks
to
modern
anthropology
,
there
are
vastly
different
moral
beliefs
across
cultures
;
this
is
called
descriptive
moral
relativism
.


Fletcher
made
the
argument
that
this
could
be
taken
as
evidence
that
there
is
not
an
innate
God-given
ability
of
reason
to
discover
the
natural
law
,
since
then
we
should
expect
more
moral
agreement
.


Freud
would
argue
that
it
is
society
which
conditions
our
moral
views
.


There
either
is
no
natural
moral
law
or
human
reason
is
unable
to
discover
it
.


So
,
what
Aquinas
thought
was
human
nature
was
really
just
his
culture
.



However
,
there
do
seem
to
be
some
core
similarities
between
the
moralities
of
different
cultures
such
as
not
killing
for
no
reason
and
rules
about
stealing
.


Reproduction
and
education
are
also
universal
.


Moral
thinkers
from
different
cultures
came
up
with
similar
moral
prescriptions
such
as
the
golden
rule
;
to
treat
others
as
you
would
like
to
be
treated
,
which
can
be
found
in
ancient
Chinese
Philosophy
,
Hinduism
,
Judaism
and
Christianity
.


This
could
be
taken
to
show
that
moral
views
are
determined
by
a
universal
human
moral
nature
.



Alternative
explanation
:
These
cross-cultural
similarities
in
moral
codes
might
have
resulted
from
a
biologically
evolved
morality
rather
than
one
designed
by
a
God
,
however
,
which
would
mean
it
is
not
related
to
a
telos
designed
by
God
.



Alternatively
,
cross-cultural
morality
might
result
merely
from
the
basic
requirement
of
a
society
to
function
.


If
anyone
could
kill
or
steal
from
anyone
else
for
no
reason
whenever
they
wanted
,
it’s
hard
to
see
how
a
society
could
exist
.


That
might
create
an
existential
pressure
which
influences
the
moral
thinkers
of
a
society
,
yielding
prescriptions
such
as
the
golden
rule
.


Cross-cultural
ethics
therefore
has
a
practical
reality
as
its
basis
,
not
God
and
not
or
not
only
evolution
.



Aquinas’
Natural
Theology

Aquinas
believed
that
human
reason
could
never
know
or
understand
God
.


However
,
Aquinas
is
a
proponent
of
natural
theology
through
reason
which
he
claimed
could
support
faith
in
God
.


Human
reason
can
gain
knowledge
of
God’s
natural
moral
law
through
the
ability
of
human
reason
to
know
the
synderesis
rule
and
primary
precepts
.



Karl
Barth
argued
that
Aquinas’
natural
law
theory
was
a
false
natural
theology
which
placed
a
dangerous
overreliance
on
human
reason
.


Barth
argued
that
if
humans
were
able
to
know
God
or
God’s
morality
through
their
own
efforts
,
then
revelation
would
be
unnecessary
.


Yet
,
God
clearly
thought
revelation
necessary
as
he
sent
Jesus
.



Barth
also
argued
that
“the
finite
has
no
capacity
for
the
infinite”
;
our
finite
minds
cannot
grasp
God’s
infinite
being
.


Whatever
humans
discover
through
reason
is
therefore
not
divine
so
to
think
it
is
must
then
amount
to
idolatry
–
the
worship
of
earthly
things
.


Barth
argued
idolatry
can
lead
to
worship
of
nations
and
then
even
to
movements
like
the
Nazis
.


It
follows
for
Barth
that
after
the
corruption
of
the
fall
,
human
reason
cannot
reach
God
or
figure
out
right
and
wrong
by
itself
.


Only
faith
in
God’s
revelation
in
the
bible
is
valid
.



In
defence
of
Aquinas
,
he
is
not
suggesting
that
our
finite
minds
can
understand
God’s
nature
or
goodness
(eternal
law)
.


Aquinas
is
only
suggesting
that
reason
can
understand
the
natural
law
God
created
within
our
nature
.


If
reason
only
has
this
goal
of
supporting
faith
in
such
ways
,
then
it
cannot
make
revealed
theology
unnecessary
.



 Tillich
defends
Aquinas
to
a
degree
,
arguing
that
Barth
was
too
negative
in
denying
the
possibility
of
reason
discovering
anything
whatsoever
of
the
natural
law
.



“there
is
self-deception
in
every
denial
of
the
natural
moral
law
…
The
very
statement
that
man
is
estranged
from
his
created
nature
presupposes
an
experience
of
the
abyss
between
what
he
essentially
is
and
what
is
existentially
is
.


Even
a
weak
or
misled
conscience
is
still
a
conscience
,
namely
,
the
silent
voice
of
man’s
own
essential
nature
,
judging
his
actual
being”
–
Tillich
.



To
deny
that
our
conscience
can
discover
the
natural
law
is
to
claim
that
there
is
a
gap
between
what
we
currently
are
and
what
we
could
be
.


Yet
,
to
have
an
awareness
of
that
gap
is
to
have
a
conscience
that
is
aware
of
its
fallen
state
.


So
it
is
contradictory
to
deny
the
natural
law
.


Even
it
now
involves
a
weakened
conscience
,
that
still
tells
us
at
least
something
of
the
direction
we
have
fallen
in
and
the
direction
back
towards
righteousness
.



However
,
whatever
a
weak
and
misled
conscience
discovers
is
surely
not
God’s
morality
.


Humanity
believing
it
has
the
ability
to
know
anything
of
God
is
the
same
arrogance
that
caused
Adam
and
Eve
to
disobey
God
.


Humanity
believing
that
it
has
the
power
to
figure
out
right
and
wrong
is
what
led
to
the
arrogant
certainty
of
the
Nazis
in
their
own
superiority
.


The
arrogance
of
natural
theology
is
evidence
of
a
human
inability
to
be
humble
enough
to
simply
have
faith
.



Psychological
views
on
the
conscience

Sigmund
Freud

Freud
thought
the
conscience
was
just
the
result
of
psychological
forces
that
science
could
understand
.


Freud
believed
the
mind
was
divided
into
the
Id
(our
unconscious
animalistic
desires)
,
Ego
(Our
conscious
decision-making
self)
and
the
Super
Ego
(the
part
of
us
that
“stores”
the
values
we
introjected
((unconsciously
adopted))
from
authority
figures
during
childhood
and
is
the
source
of
our
moral
feelings)
.


When
a
desire
bubbles
up
from
the
unconscious
Id
into
our
conscious
Ego
,
we
become
aware
of
wanting
to
act
on
it
,
but
our
Super
Ego
then
tells
us
whether
the
values
of
our
society
allow
it
.


If
so
,
we
can
act
on
it
.


If
not
,
we
have
been
conditioned
to
repress
that
desire
,
which
Freud
thought
responsible
for
many
mental
problems
.



The
ethical
implications
is
that
conscience
is
not
the
voice
of
God
in
us
,
it
is
just
what
our
society
wants
from
us
.


Our
society
might
be
good
or
bad
,
therefore
our
conscience
is
not
the
best
guide
if
Freud
is
right
.


Furthermore
there
might
not
even
be
a
‘good
or
bad’
,
if
morality
is
merely
the
conditioning
of
societies
on
its
members
.



Freud
was
influenced
by
Nietzsche
who
argued
that
human
conscious
mind
(what
Freud
called
the
ego)
developed
by
necessity
when
humans
underwent
the
radical
change
from
hunter-gatherer
to
farmer
.


Our
natural
animalistic
instincts
(What
Freud
called
the
Id)
were
of
less
use
to
us
in
the
new
environment
of
society
,
in
fact
they
were
a
hinderance
as
they
called
on
us
to
behave
in
ways
that
would
make
society
fall
apart
.


Consciousness
emerged
as
the
space
in-between
our
instincts
and
the
outside
world
as
a
mediator
which
had
to
decide
which
instincts
to
act
on
and
which
not
to
.



Freud’s
theory
of
psychosexual
development
relates
to
his
theory
of
the
id
,
ego
and
superego
.


Freud
thought
that
the
process
of
being
socialised
–
being
inducted
into
society
–
required
children
to
learn
to
control
their
Id
.


This
process
of
learning
was
developmental
in
that
it
comes
in
stages
.


If
self-control
is
not
learned
at
a
particular
stage
,
it
can
lead
to
issues
later
in
life
.



Oral
stage
:
Between
birth
and
1
.

5
years
old
.


Babies
breastfeed
,
and
explore
the
world
by
putting
things
in
their
mouth
.


Failure
to
develop
properly
during
this
stage
can
lead
to
smoking
or
overeating
.



Anal
stage
:
1
.

5
–
3
years
old
.


The
ego
develops
at
this
time
and
pleasure
is
gained
through
exercising
self-control
over
going
to
the
toilet
.


Those
who
overly-control
become
a
control
freak
,
those
who
do
not
learn
to
control
enough
become
messy
.



Phallic
stage
:
3-6
years
old
.


Children
become
aware
of
their
genitals
and
their
gender
.


Oedipus
and
Electra
complex
develops
–
jealousy
of
the
parent
of
the
same
sex
for
the
time
and
attention
they
take
from
the
parent
of
opposite
same
sex
.


Problems
moving
through
this
stage
cause
intimacy
issues
later
in
life
.



Latency
stage
:
6-puberty
.


Sexual
desire
develops
and
is
repressed
.


Gender
roles
are
learned
.



Mature
genital
stage
:
lasts
until
death
.


Controlled
sexual
desires
result
in
a
desire
for
love
and
marriage
.


A
person
now
has
a
fully
developed
conscience
where
the
ego
controls
the
Id
with
reference
to
the
superego
.



Freud
has
been
criticised
by
contemporary
psychologists
for
not
being
empirical
enough
.


Karl
Popper
criticised
Freud’s
theory
for
being
‘unfalsifiable’
as
it
could
not
say
what
would
prove
it
wrong
.


This
means
it
is
not
true
empiricism
.


Freud
studied
a
small
sample
size
of
patients
,
a
poor
cross-section
of
society
and
did
not
do
proper
experiments
,
so
he
is
unscientific
.


However
,
Popper
was
clear
that
he
wasn’t
saying
there
was
absolutely
nothing
of
value
in
Freud’s
ideas
–
just
that
they
needed
to
be
subjected
to
proper
scientific
experiment
and
testing
.



Piaget
was
a
contemporary
psychologist
who
developed
better
empirical
methods
of
experiment
than
Freud
but
came
to
similar
conclusions
,
so
can
thus
be
seen
to
defend
Freud
to
some
degree
from
the
accusation
of
being
unscientific
.


He
studied
the
development
of
children
and
argued
that
there
occurs
a
fundamental
shift
in
the
nature
of
‘conscience’
.


Before
the
age
of
11
children
have
what
he
called
heteronomous
morality
.


This
means
they
merely
associate
actions
as
bad
because
of
the
influence
of
their
authority
figures
like
parents
.


For
example
,
an
8
year
old
child
dangerously
runs
into
a
road
and
their
parent
yells
at
them
.


The
child
will
learn
not
to
do
that
again
,
but
not
because
they
have
cognitively
understood
that
running
into
the
road
will
cause
them
injury
or
death
which
would
be
a
bad
thing
,
but
because
they
merely
associate
the
action
of
running
into
the
road
with
the
loud
scary
noise
of
their
parents
shouting
occurring
.


After
11
year
old
however
,
Piaget
argued
that
the
autonomous
morality
develops
in
children
,
where
they
can
begin
to
have
abstract
cognitive
moral
beliefs
about
how
one
ought
to
act
and
why
.



Freud’s
critique
of
religion’s
approach
to
developing
the
conscience

Maintaining
social
order
depends
on
people
repressing
their
anti-social
instincts
(e
.

g
.


for
sex
and
violence)
.


Religion
encourages
repression
and
for
that
Freud
thought
it
had
done
“great
services
for
human
civilization”
in
the
“taming
of
the
asocial
instincts”
.


Nonetheless
,
Freud
thought
that
the
Christian
belief
system
had
long
passed
its
usefulness
because
a
secular
society
would
be
far
superior
at
enabling
self-control
.


So
,
society
would
be
better
off
outgrowing
religion
.



Freud
evaluates
religion
and
its
doctrines
not
as
claims
about
reality
but
as
strategies
for
controlling
instincts
.


For
example
,
for
Freud
,
belief
in
and
propagation
of
the
idea
that
human
nature
is
corrupted
by
original
sin
is
really
just
a
method
of
dealing
with
our
natural
instincts
,
but
a
primitive
and
childish
method
that
actually
causes
as
much
immorality
and
unhappiness
as
it
prevents
.


Viewing
humanity
as
inherently
sinful
and
only
God
as
good
,
who
easily
forgives
sins
,
does
not
provide
the
proper
motivation
for
following
religious
social
rules
,
causing
frequent
“backslidings
into
sin”
and
seeking
of
penance
.



After
millennia
of
religious
rule
,
too
many
people
are
still
unhappy
being
controlled
by
social
rules
.


Freud
claims
this
is
because
the
religious
approach
to
conscience
is
external
imposition
by
authority
,
similar
to
how
children
are
treated
,
the
result
being
comparable
to
a
‘childhood
neurosis’
.


Although
rules
are
in
place
to
reduce
suffering
,
they
also
cause
suffering
through
repression
and
thus
inspire
unconscious
resentment
against
civilisation
.



Freud
argues
that
the
better
approach
for
society
would
be
autonomy
.


People
can
rationally
understand
that
repressing
their
instincts
is
for
the
good
of
social
order
,
making
them
capable
of
choosing
autonomously
to
follow
social
rules
.


This
makes
them
more
likely
to
happily
accept
and
follow
them
.


Furthermore
,
this
would
also
introduce
flexibility
into
the
rules
.


If
it
were
accepted
that
the
social
rules
of
human
origin
with
the
intention
of
improving
society
,
then
they
could
be
continually
improved
,
further
encouraging
adherence
to
them
.



Ultimately
,
the
effectiveness
of
religious
rules
as
tools
for
social
order
depends
on
the
notion
that
a
God
has
decreed
them
,
which
inexorably
burdens
religious
social
order
with
the
psychology
of
external
imposition
and
the
inflexibility
of
eternal
unchanging
‘laws
of
God’
.


Freud
concludes
that
society
would
be
much
better
off
if
it
could
admit
that
the
purpose
of
its
social
rules
is
the
maintenance
of
social
order
,
rather
than
their
“pretended
sanctity”
.



Aquinas’
natural
law
ethics
arguably
gets
around
Freud’s
critique
,
because
Aquinas
thought
that
following
of
the
natural
law
did
involve
the
engagement
of
a
person’s
rationality
with
God’s
eternal
law
in
a
way
that
enabled
their
virtue
and
flourishing
.


It’s
not
simply
externally
imposed
and
there
is
a
degree
of
flexibility
in
the
application
of
the
primary
precepts
and
use
of
the
double
effect
.



Perhaps
Freud’s
critique
only
really
works
against
approaches
to
the
conscience
like
Augustine’s
where
it
simply
involves
an
external
imposition
of
God’s
law
.

Conscience

I
.


Definition

Conscience
is
a
faculty
of
the
mind
that
motivates
us
to
act
morally—or
at
least
according
to
our
most
deeply
held
values
.

 
Most
say
it
is
a
form
of
intuition
and
uses
emotion
,
although
others
have
argued
that
it
should
be
shaped
by
reason
.

 
It
is
a
private
experience
,
and
a
form
of
self-knowledge
;
from
one’s
conscience
one
can
learn
one’s
own
values
and
morals
.

 
This
is
the
root
of
the
word
,
from
the
latin
con-scientia
,
perhaps
translatable
as
“together-with-knowing”
–
to
be
together
with
one’s
knowledge
(of
morality)
.



Yet
,
conscience
has
been
thought
by
many
to
be
informed
by
an
objective
morality
,
with
divine
,
transcendental
,
or
natural
sources
.

 
Even
in
our
society
,
where
we
ostensibly
recognize
the
cultural
and
personal
relativity
of
morality
,
conscience
is
granted
a
special
status
,
with
laws
protecting
the
rights
of
doctors
and
others
not
to
violate
their
consciences
.

 
So
,
conscience
is
private
,
subjective
,
and
culturally
relative
,
but
carries
legal
and
political
weight
.



There
are
many
different
ideas
about
conscience—religious
,
philosophical
,
scientific
,
legal
,
and
popular
:

-
Religious
:
in
most
religions
,
the
morality
that
informs
conscience

does
or
should
come
from
either
God
,
or
an
enlightened
mind
.



Religions
differ
as
to
whether
conscience
is
thought
of
mainly
as
a

punisher
(e
.

g
.


Catholic)
or
as
a
virtue
to
be
cultivated
(e
.

g
.



Protestant
,
Buddhist)
.


-
Philosophical
:
many
philosophers
have
written
that
a
truly
moral

conscience
requires
the
exercise
of
reason
;
others
have
claimed
that

it
is
an
intuition
of
objective
moral
truth
.


Pre-modern
philosophers

tended
to
believe
in
a
natural
and
objective
morality
informing

conscience—something
like
a
truly
moral
instinct
.

 
Modern

philosophers
tend
to
recognize
the
cultural
and
individual

relativity
of
morality
,
and
many
present
arguments
based
on

scientific
theories
about
mind
,
evolution
,
and
society
.


-
Scientific
:
such
as
theories
in
evolutionary
psychology
,
cognitive

science
,
and
sociology
.


-
Legal
:
Our
society
seems
to
recognize
“freedom
of
conscience”
–
that

we
should
be
free
to
obey
our
consciences
–
within
limits
.



Considering
that
we
don’t
have
a
clear
or
unified
philosophy
of

conscience
,
this
raises
legal
,
political
,
and
social
issues
.


-
Popular
:
Our
everyday
notions
of
conscience
are
philosophically

interesting
.


Consider
that
conscience
is
a
part
of
us
opposing

actions
that
we
ourselves
apparently
already
consider
immoral
,
but

are
in
danger
of
doing
anyway
.

 
It
seems
a
little
paradoxical
.

 
Why

do
we
need
a
conscience
?


Evolutionary
theory
most
likely
has
the

answer
(see
“History”
section)

Thought
about
conscience
is
so
diverse
and
complex
that
a
comprehensive
treatment
is
not
possible
.


This
seems
another
paradox
about
conscience
;
we
know
it
most
intimately
in
ourselves
,
but
there
is
no
consensus
about
where
it
comes
from
,
or
how
much
it
should
be
respected
.

Controversies
about
Conscience

Freedom
of
conscience
is
part
of
the
United
Nations’
Declaration
of
Human
Rights
,
and
the
laws
of
many
nations
.

 
Yet
we
have
reason
to
question
the
idea
.

 
Former
Nazi
generals
have
told
interviewers
that
they
acted
with
a
clear
conscience
,
because
their
actions
were
sanctioned
by
their
leadership
and
society
.

 
This
would
be
consistent
with
ideas
about
conscience
as
a
social
instinct
,
but
not
necessarily
an
altruistic
one
as
Darwin
thought—perhaps
conscience
merely
urges
us
to
conform
with
the
mores
of
our
society
or
belief-systems
.



Freedom
of
conscience
is
problematic
because
it’s
perfectly
possible
for
people’s
consciences
to
insist
on
actions
that
most
of
consider
harmful
to
other
human
beings—such
as
refusing
to
vaccinate
their
children
.



There
are
several
traditional
arguments
in
favor
of
freedom
of
conscience
:

-
The
argument
from
hypocrisy
or
ineffectiveness
:
Most
people
agree

that
it
is
impossible
to
change
a
person’s
conscience
from
the

outside
;
therefore
,
not
granting
freedom
of
conscience
means

requiring
people
to
act
contrary
to
their
beliefs
,
which
seems

wrong
.


This
was
a
reason
to
consider
persecuting
heretics

ineffective
from
the
medieval
Catholic
point
of
view
;
but
Aquinas

and
others
then
justified
it
for
other
reasons
.



However
,
the
argument
from
hypocrisy
can
be
turned
around
;
if
you
can’t
change
a
person’s
conscience
,
then
they
still
have
freedom
of
conscience
,
even
if
you
force
them
to
behave
in
a
certain
way
.



-
The
argument
from
ignorance
:
This
is
based
on
the
recognition
of

relativism
and
subjectivism
.


If
our
consciences
don’t
give
us

objective
moral
guidance
,
then
you
can’t
assume
that
yours
is
right

and
another’s
wrong
,
therefore
you
don’t
have
a
right
to
deny
them

freedom
of
conscience
.


-
The
argument
from
legitimization
:
John
Stuart
Mill
argued
that
it
is

best
for
society
if
all
people
express
their
convictions
freely
,
for

that
will
make
it
possible
,
through
comparison
and
debate
,
to
better

approach
truth
.



However
,
none
of
these
arguments
completely
addresses
the
conflicts
between
freedom
of
conscience
and
public
well-being
.

 
Some
might
say
that
a
doctor
who
refuses
to
perform
a
life-saving
operation
out
of
conscience
should
be
charged
with
negligence
or
even
manslaughter
.

 
While
others
might
feel
that
performing
the
operation
is
murder
.


The
precise
limits
of
freedom
of
conscience
are
still
an
open
debate
with
profound
consequences
.

This
quote
seems
to
represent
the
way
most
of
us
naturally
think
of
conscience—assuming
that
conscience
is
always
right
,
as
if
it’s
a
direct
line
to
God
or
some
other
source
of
objective
moral
knowledge
.

 
This
also
implies
that
it
is
right
to
obey
conscience
even
if
opposes
one’s
social
and
legal
environment
.

 
One
the
one
hand
,
these
could
be
incorrect

on
the
other
,
we
could
never
change

Types
of
Conscience

There
are
no
‘types
of
conscience’
recognized
by
philosophers
except
‘critical
conscience’
which
means
the
application
of
critical
reasoning
to
ethical
decisions
.

 
Many
religious
web-pages
list
their
own
types
of
conscience
,
in
light
of
their
beliefs
.



Conscience
versus
Sociopathy

Sociopaths
are
,
arguably
,
individuals
with
no
conscience
.

 
They
are
also
defined
as
incapable
of
feeling
empathy
,
guilt
,
fear
,
or
shame
at
hurting
others
or
violating
any
notion
of
morality
.

 
Interestingly
,
psychologists
say
that
sociopaths
understand
morality
and
may
even
agree
with
the
moral
values
of
their
society
.

 
They
lack
only
the
brain
connection
between
those
values
and
the
emotions
that
would
prevent
them
from
hurting
others
,
enabling
them
to
act
without
remorse
.

 
Most
experts
claim
that
it
is
an
incurable
condition
and
neuroscientific
research
shows
concrete
differences
between
normal
and
sociopathic
brains
.

 
Ironically
,
then
sociopaths
seem
to
be
evidence
that
a
capacity
for
conscience
is
innate
in
normal
humans
.

History
of
Conscience

Before
cultural
relativity
and
subjectivism
came
into
vogue
during
the
20^(th)
century
,
conscience
was
considered
a
source
of
objective
moral
knowledge
by
almost
everyone
,
however
in
different
senses
in
different
cultures
.

 
In
ancient
Hinduism
,
Buddhism
,
and
Taoism
,
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
was
thought
to
be
the
natural
long-term
result
of
practicing
moral
action
and
correct
contemplation–in
Hindu
thought
,
through
the
accumulation
of
good
karma
,
in
Buddhist
and
Taoist
thought
,
through
purification
of
the
heart
and
mind
.


Moral
knowledge
in
these
belief-systems
was
an
aspect
of
enlightened
mind—true
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
self
and
reality
.


Ironically
though
,
each
belief
system
had
different
ideas
about
the
content
of
this
truth
,
and
morality
.

 
In
Hinduism
,
it
was
primarily
about
self-sacrifice
,
in
Buddhism
compassion
,
and
in
Taoism
,
harmony
with
society
and
nature
.



Judaism
,
Christianity
,
and
Islam
represented
a
very
different
conception
,
arguably
.

 
All
three
religions
are
supposed
to
accept
the
story
of
Genesis
which
says
that
man’s
acquisition
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
was
a
fall
from
grace
,
‘original
sin
.

’ 
Therefore
,
according
to
some
interpretations
,
following
one’s
own
intuitions
is
more
likely
a
source
of
sin
than
morality
.

 
Instead
,
obedience
to
God’s
law
is
thought
the
only
true
morality
.

 
This
would
mean
that
true
conscience
is
knowledge
of
God’s
law
,
whether
that
comes
directly
from
God
,
or
through
obedience
to
scripture
or
clergy
;
all
these
possibilities—direct
revelation
,
scripture
,
and
obedience
to
authorities–have
been
claimed
as
the
source
of
moral
knowledge
in
these
religions
.

 
However
,
in
practice
,
these
religions
also
teach
purification
of
the
mind
to
attain
true
conscience
;
where
Eastern
religions
teach
that
a
pure
mind
allows
the
truth
to
emerge
from
within
one’s
own
consciousness
,
most
versions
of
the
Abrahamic
religions
see
a
pure
mind
as
a
prerequisite
for
receiving
God’s
truth
.



Greek
and
Roman
thought
emphasized
reason
and
knowledge
in
making
moral
decisions
,
a
tradition
beginning
with
Aristotle’s
ideas
about
the
development
of
virtuous
character
and
wisdom
through
reason
and
practice
.

 
This
is
also
true
of
Judaism
,
known
for
its
Talmud
,
a
body
of
writing
devoted
to
interpreting
scripture
and
applying
it
to
ethical
issues
through
rational
analysis
and
debate
.



Despite
the
emphasis
on
blind
obedience
in
Christianity
,
medieval
Christian
philosophers
developed
a
theory
of
conscience
with
a
strong
role
for
both
intuition
and
reasoning
.

 
St
.


Bonaventure
and
St
.


Aquinas
wrote
of
synderesis
–
a
divine
spark
of
moral
knowledge
–
which
could
only
come
to
a
mind
which
had
been
cultivated
by
reason
and
contemplation
to
overcome
the
distortions
and
corruption
of
social
conditioning
.



In
the
17^(th)
century
,
Spinoza
similarly
wrote
that
it
was
necessary
to
practice
and
develop
reason
to
transcend
socially
conditioned
emotions
and
perceptions
.

 
However
instead
of
positing
a
diving
spark
as
the
source
of
moral
truth
,
Spinoza
said
that
if
you
view
problems
from
the
perspective
of
eternity
,
with
a
peaceful
mind
,
you
will
perceive
moral
truth
.

  
Kant
also
regarded
critical
reasoning
as
an
important
element
of
conscience
,
believing
that
moral
truth
could
be
evaluated
objectively
in
light
of
his
‘categorical
imperative
.

’ 
Other
18^(th)
century
philosophers
believed
that
conscience
was
purely
intuitive
,
excluding
reason
,
but
like
Kant
,
many
of
them
also
believed
in
the
objectivity
of
the
moral
truth
informing
conscience
.



From
the
18^(th)
century
on
,
increasing
numbers
of
philosophers
spoke
for
pragmatic
and
relativistic
ideas
about
conscience
.

 
John
Locke
wrote
about
how
a
moral
conscience
might
oppose
the
laws
of
the
state
,
and
Thomas
Hobbes
insisted
that
opinions
based
on
conscience
could
easily
be
wrong
or
in
contradiction
to
other
people’s
consciences
.

 
So
,
these
and
other
philosophers
also
advocated
for
a
‘critical
conscience’–and
some
skepticism
about
the
dictates
of
conscience
in
general
.



In
the
19^(th)
century
,
Darwin
hypothesized
that
conscience
evolved
to
resolve
conflicts
between
instincts
,
such
as
between
instincts
for
self-preservation
and
instincts
to
protect
and
cooperate
with
other
human
beings
.



In
the
20^(th)
century
,
Freud
analyzed
conscience
as
an
effect
of
the
super-ego
;
as
we
grow
up
,
natural
instincts
such
as
aggression
and
sexual
desire
must
be
frequently
frustrated
,
and
even
punished
,
by
parents
and
peers
,
in
order
for
us
to
develop
into
well-adjusted
members
of
society
.

 
This
process
creates
the
super-ego
,
where
we
internalize
the
beliefs
,
implicit
or
explicit
,
about
right
and
wrong
in
our
culture
and
the
super-ego
causes
us
to
feel
guilt
or
anxiety
when
we
violate
them
.



Where
Darwin
said
that
conscience
evolved
to
resolve
inner
conflicts
,
other
more
recent
evolutionary
psychologists
suggest
that
it
evolved
to
motivate
altruistic
behavior
,
which
is
now
thought
to
be
evolutionarily
adaptive
for
social
creatures
.



Few
today
would
claim
that
conscience
is
a
source
of
objective
morality
,
divine
,
transcendental
or
otherwise
,
since
it
is
obvious
that
two
people’s
consciences
or
religions
can
dictate
opposing
moralities—such
as
pro-choice
and
pro-life
.

  
Therefore
,
philosophers
today
are
more
concerned
with
exploring
the
consequences
of
this
relativity
of
conscience
,
especially
since
people
still
seem
to
think
of
conscience
as
objectively
true
,
sacred
,
and
inviolable
.


Which
leads
naturally
to
our
controversy
–
“freedom
of
conscience
.

Introduction

Each
of
us
has
,
at
one
time
or
another
,
talked
about
our
conscience
.


We
might
have
been
“pricked
by
our
conscience”
or
our
conscience
might
have
“butted
in”
when
it
was
not
wanted
.


We
might
be
going
on
quite
happily
telling
a
lie
to
a
friend
,
or
might
have
accidentally
walked
out
of
a
shop
without
paying
for
something
and
it
is
our
conscience
that
makes
us
confess
or
stops
us
in
our
tracks
spins
us
on
our
heels
and
takes
us
back
into
the
shop
.



People
from
different
walks
of
life
talk
of
the
“conscience”
,
from
the
religious
believer
,
the
politician
,
the
celebrity
,
to
every
day
folk
;
we
might
hear
someone
berate
their
conscience
for
nagging
them
to
do
something
they
do
not
want
to
.


People
might
be
labelled
“conscientious
objectors”
because
they
feel
their
conscience
is
telling
them
to
object
to
certain
political
actions
,
e
.

g
.


war
.


A
protester
might
lament
the
erosion
of
their
“freedom
of
conscience”
.


And
we
can
find
concepts
very
similar
to
“conscience”
in
many
non-Christian
religious
traditions
both
Eastern
and
Western
throughout
history
and
from
around
the
globe
.

However
,
the
nature
of
conscience
is
obscure
and
consequently
the
philosophical
discussion
of
conscience
is
complex
and
has
a
long
history
.


It
draws
on
issues
in
philosophical
psychology
,
philosophy
of
religion
,
epistemology
,
philosophy
of
mind
,
applied
ethics
,
normative
ethics
and
Metaethics
.



In
this
chapter
we’ll
give
a
general
overview
of
two
theories
of
conscience
.


One
draws
on
Aquinas’s
account
;
the
other
Sigmund
Freud’s
(1856–1939)
.


Although
Freud
is
not
typically
seen
as
a
philosopher
(he’s
a
psychologist)
his
account
will
provide
us
with
some
insights
which
allows
us
to
think
philosophically
about
this
thing
we
call
“the
conscience”
.

.


The
History
of
Conscience

In
the
twenty-first
century
conscience
is
not
thought
of
as
solely
a
religious
idea
.


However
talk
of
“conscience”
was
popularised
,
at
least
in
“the
West”
,
due
to
its
adoption
by
both
Protestant
and
Catholic
traditions
.


In
this
section
we’ll
look
how
“conscience”
is
,
and
has
been
,
used
in
order
to
draw
out
some
general
features
.



“Conscience”
played
a
role
in
one
of
the
most
famous
speeches
in
the
protestant
reformation
.


Martin
Luther
(1483–1546)
,
being
charged
with
heresy
and
being
forced
to
recant
by
Charles
V
,
stands
his
grounds
and
says
“Here
I
stand
,
I
can
do
no
other”
and
“I
cannot
nor
will
I
retract
anything
,
since
it
is
never
safe
nor
virtuous
to
go
against
conscience”
.


Luther
believed
that
his
God-given
conscience
was
not
allowing
him
to
recant
,
not
even
under
the
considerable
pressure
by
the
powerful
people
before
him
.


Or
consider
a
more
recent
example
.



In
the
midst
of
political
turmoil
of
the
civil
rights
movement
Martin
Luther
King
Jr
.


,
who
was
under
threat
and
constant
pressure
to
change
his
views
said
:

But
,
conscience
asks
the
question
,
is
it
right
?


And
there
comes
a
time
when
we
must
take
a
position
that
is
neither
safe
,
nor
politic
,
nor
popular
,
but
one
must
take
it
because
it
is
right
.

2

Conscience
is
,
then
,
powerful
.


It
seems
that
it
can
move
a
person
to
put
themselves
in
mortal
danger
,
to
“stand
up
and
be
counted”
,
to
act
contrary
to
self-interest
.



But
it
is
not
just
saints
and
heroes
that
talk
of
conscience
,
conscience
has
been
cited
by
the
most
repugnant
and
morally
abhorrent
people
who
have
ever
lived
,
racists
,
murderers
,
tyrants
,
dictators
.


For
example
as
Bettina
Stangneth’s
states
in
Eichmann
Before
Jerusalem
:
The
Unexamined
Life
of
a
Mass
Murderer
,3
a
discussion
of
the
inner
life
of
one
of
the
Nazi’s
most
notorious
officers
:
“Conscience
was
simply
the
‘morality
of
the
Fatherland
that
dwells
within’
a
person
,
which
Eichmann
also
termed
‘the
voice
of
the
blood’”
.



Conscience
can
be
male
or
female
or
both
or
neither
,
it
can
be
one
voice
or
many
,
it
can
echo
religious
ideas
,
social
ideas
,
racist
ideas
,
lofty
ideas
or
ideas
found
in
the
filth
of
human
corruption
.


Conscience
can
develop
at
any
particular
age
and
dissipates
at
any
age
.


It
does
not
“speak”
,
and
it
does
“speak”
,
and
does
not
have
a
language
of
choice
.


All
of
these
observations
then
leave
a
number
of
observations
and
questions
.



There
seem
to
be
(at
least)
three
related
functions
that
we
think
the
conscience
plays
.


First
,
it
tells
us
what
we
ought
to
do
as
a
guide
for
our
lives
.


Second
,
it
is
a
source
of
moral
knowledge
.


That
is
,
we
might
say
“I
know
that
stealing
a
pen
is
wrong
because
my
conscience
told
me”
.


Third
it
might
be
thought
of
as
a
motivation
.


That
is
,
it
might
be
the
thing
that
actually
gets
us
up
out
of
our
seat
to
act
in
certain
ways
,
even
when
things
are
difficult
or
even
life
threatening
.



Just
to
clarify
,
we
can
see
the
difference
in
the
first
two
of
these
functions
if
we
think
of
a
tyrant
who
says
for
example
:
“my
conscience
tells
me
I
have
to
kill
all
mentally
ill
people
to
help
the
country”
.


Clearly
this
is
a
case
where
her
conscience
is
telling
her
how
she
ought
to
behave
.


But
,
given
that
we
think
that
killing
the
mentally
ill
is
morally
wrong
,
we
do
not
want
to
say
that
in
this
case
her
conscience
gives
her
knowledge
of
what
is
right
and
wrong
.


So
it
might
be
true
that
the
conscience
gives
us
guidance
but
not
knowledge
.



Equally
the
opposite
seems
true
,
that
we
might
know
what
is
right
and
wrong
yet
fail
to
be
guided
to
do
it
.


This
predicament
is
what
Shakespeare
captured
in
this
famous
quotation
:
“conscience
doth
make
cowards
of
us
all”
(Hamlet
3
.

1
.

78–82)
.



Consider
another
point
.


Conscience
is
subjective
in
that
it
is
about
one
reflecting
inwards
on
oneself
,
on
how
one
might
“feel”
about
certain
things
.


It
is
not
about
looking
out
into
the
world
,
at
a
set
of
rules
or
laws
.


We
experience
the
conscience
differently
than
we
would
if
a
friend
,
priest
,
politician
or
Imam
was
telling
us
what
to
do
.


Of
course
,
although
conscience
is
“inward
looking”
,
that
is
not
the
same
as
saying
that
we
just
make
up
what
the
conscience
allegedly
tells
us
.


For
instance
,
we
might
think
that
what
is
right
and
wrong
is
dependent
on
God
but
also
think
that
we
come
to
know
what
is
right
and
wrong
through
our
conscience
.



Finally
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
term
“conscience”
was
only
formalized
in
its
modern
moral
meaning
in
the
mid
eighteenth
century
(e
.

g
.


neither
Plato
nor
Aristotle
talk
of
conscience)
.


However
,
note
that
just
because
a
term
is
modern
,
or
just
because
there
is
disagreement
with
how
a
term
is
used
,
that
does
not
mean
that
the
ideas
themselves
are
new
.



Consider
the
point
that
the
terms
“molecules”
and
“atoms”
were
recent
inventions
,
and
that
in
their
development
they
might
be
used
to
talk
about
different
things
,
and
they
engendered
disagreement
within
the
scientific
community
.


This
in
itself
does
not
lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
there
are
no
molecules
and
no
atoms
.


So
the
lack
of
term
“conscience”
,
and
disagreement
about
what
“conscience”
means
does
not
mean
that
conscience
is
merely
an
“invention”
.


With
all
these
points
in
mind
let’s
consider
one
of
the
key
thinkers
in
relation
to
conscience
,
Aquinas
.



3

Aquinas
on
Conscience

If
you
recall
from
Aquinas
developed
a
Natural
Law
theology
.


The
basic
idea
is
that
through
reason
(what
he
calls
ratio)
we
can
come
to
recognize
certain
precepts
that
we
ought
to
live
by
.


Aquinas
thinks
that
this
reliance
on
thinking
and
reflection
is
revealed
in
the
Bible
:

They
show
that
the
requirements
of
the
law
are
written
on
their
hearts
,
their
consciences
also
bearing
witness
,
and
their
thoughts
sometimes
accusing
them
and
at
other
times
even
defending
them
.

4

Notice
then
that
for
Paul
—
and
Aquinas
—
the
“conscience”
bears
witness
sometimes
accusing
the
person
,
sometimes
defending
them
.


For
Aquinas
conscience
is
morally
neutral
,
it
simply
“bears
witness”
,
it
is
a
“sign-post”
and
after
all
signposts
do
not
opinions
on
things
(see
Aquinas
,
Summa
,
Part
1
,
Question
79
,
Article
13)
.



To
be
clear
then
Aquinas
did
not
take
conscience
to
be
a
source
of
moral
knowledge
but
as
a
guide
.


This
means
that
Aquinas
,
unlike
Luther
and
post-reformation
thinkers
,
took
conscience
to
be
fallible
.


For
Aquinas
we
may
be
wrong
in
following
our
conscience
as
it
can
move
us
in
the
wrong
direction/mislead
us

For
Aquinas
the
conscience
is
the
act
of
applying
the
universal
principles
(the
Eternal/Divine
law)
to
actual
real
life
situations
.



Aquinas
explicitly
defines
“conscience”
as
the
“application
of
knowledge
to
activity”
(Summa
Theologica
,
I–II
,
I)
.


So
,
if
conscience
for
Aquinas
is
about
the
application
of
knowledge
to
activity
,
this
raises
the
question
how
we
get
this
knowledge
?


This
is
where
another
key
technical
term
is
introduced
.


The
synderesis
.


Synderesis
is
not
the
same
as
conscience
but
is
the
innate
ability
of
the
mind
—
what
he
calls
a
habit
of
the
mind
—
to
apprehend
the
eternal/divine
laws
.


The
role
of
conscience
is
to
apply
the
primary
precepts
discovered
as
the
content
of
synderesis
.



To
get
a
better
understanding
of
synderesis
consider
someone
trying
to
work
out
the
quickest
way
to
get
between
two
points
.


Through
rational
reflection
they
will
see
that
it
is
the
straight
line
.


This
“coming
to
recognize
through
reflection”
is
what
Aquinas
has
in
mind
when
he
talks
about
synderesis
.


For
Aquinas
,
unlike
conscience
,
synderesis
is
never
mistaken
.


Humans
do
wrong
,
thinks
Aquinas
,
when
conscience
(and
not
synderesis)
makes
a
mistake
.


This
means
that
a
failure
of
conscience
needs
to
be
clearly
thought
through
on
Aquinas’s
account
.



For
Aquinas
,
conscience
errs
because
of
ignorance
about
how
to
apply
the
eternal/divine
laws
,
of
which
there
are
two
types
.


Ignorance
that
can
be
overcome
by
using
one’s
reason
(vincible
ignorance)
,
and
ignorance
that
cannot
be
overcome
by
using
one’s
reason
(invincible
ignorance)
.


Invincible
ignorance
is
doing
something
wrong
when
one
could
not
have
known
better
;
vincible
ignorance
is
doing
wrong
when
one
ought
to
have
known
better
.


But
how
might
this
relate
to
conscience
?



Imagine
two
people
going
into
a
gun
shop
.


The
first
person
has
no
criminal
record
,
has
never
been
in
trouble
with
the
police
nor
at
school
and
they
have
no
record
of
mental
illness
.


He
is
,
for
all
intents
and
purposes
,
a
model
citizen
.


This
person
buys
a
gun
and
goes
on
a
killing
rampage
.


The
owner
of
the
shop
,
by
following
her
conscience
,
has
not
done
something
morally
wrong
because
her
ignorance
is
invincible
;
there
was
no
indication
that
this
would
have
been
a
likely
outcome
.



This
contrasts
to
the
person
who
is
sold
a
gun
even
though
he
has
a
violent
criminal
record
which
would
have
shown
up
on
a
basic
background
check
.


In
this
case
,
the
owner
of
the
gun
shop
following
her
conscience
has
done
something
morally
wrong
because
in
this
case
her
ignorance
is
vincible
.



To
conclude
,
Aquinas
thinks
all
of
us
can
know
infallibly
what
is
right
and
wrong
through
synderesis
.


However
,
even
though
we
are
infallible
about
this
,
we
can
,
and
do
,
make
mistakes
in
applying
this
knowledge
.


It
is
our
conscience
(conscientia)
which
tells
us
how
to
apply
this
knowledge
and
moves
us
to
act
.


It
can
go
wrong
through
ignorance
.


Ignorance
which
could
have
been
avoided
(vincible)
means
our
action
is
morally
wrong
.


Mistakes
deriving
from
ignorance
we
could
not
have
avoided
(invincible)
means
our
action
is
not
morally
wrong
.



In
the
next
section
,
we
will
consider
what
Freud
has
to
say
about
conscience
,
and
explain
how
he
reconceptualises
it
as
a
psychological
and
not
theological
concept
,
and
in
doing
so
argues
we
should
not
accept
it
as
an
inherently
good
notion
.

Freud
and
the
Conscience

Freud
is
best
known
as
a
psychologist
and
the
architect
of
psychoanalysis
.


He
is
controversial
and
most
philosophers
and
psychologists
reject
the
ideas
he
presents
.


However
,
his
ideas
have
been
incredibly
influential
,
and
indeed
his
name
has
entered
our
everyday
talk
in
the
form
of
a
“Freudian
slip”
.


Among
Freud’s
many
ideas
his
conceptualization
of
the
structure
of
the
mind
is
key
to
his
views
on
conscience
.


He
thinks
the
mind
can
be
thought
of
as
containing
three
parts
:
the
id
,
the
ego
and
the
super-ego
.


Freud’s
account
of
conscience
is
understood
as
the
relation
between
these
.



For
Freud
the
id
is
the
collection
of
our
primal
drives
,
e
.

g
.


the
basic
desires
for
food
,
sex
,
drink
and
is
the
oldest
part
of
the
mind
.


The
id
cannot
be
properly
formalized
or
understood
and
Freud
likens
it
to
chaos
.


It
is
instinctive
,
emotional
and
illogical
.


We
cannot
list
all
the
drives
that
make
up
the
id
as
they
are
inaccessible
to
us
.


Freud
has
a
nice
way
of
describing
the
id
;
he
calls
it
:
“…a
cauldron
full
of
seething
excitations…”
.


(SE
,
XXII
.

73)
.


Although
we
can
say
very
little
about
the
content
of
the
id
,
Freud
did
think
that
there
was
a
general
principle
to
help
us
understand
the
drives
in
the
id
,
what
he
calls
the
“pleasure
principle”
.


This
is
the
claim
that
what
identifies
and
unifies
the
drives
of
the
id
is
the
avoidance
of
pain
and
pursuit
of
pleasure
.



Now
,
as
a
very
young
child
it
may
be
OK
to
be
driven
by
the
pleasure
principle
;
they
crawl
single-mindedly
after
the
chocolate
buttons
to
put
in
their
mouth
,
they
crave
their
mother’s
milk
irrespective
of
anything
else
.


However
,
as
we
develop
we
soon
realize
that
we
cannot
simply
act
on
the
primal
instincts
of
the
id
as
we
have
to
navigate
ourselves
in
the
social
spaces
we
inhabit
!


We
have
to
understand
boundaries
,
sanctions
and
consequences
.


To
successfully
operate
in
the
world
,
we
need
to
consciously
reflect
and
reason
and
ultimately
,
we
have
to
delay
instinctive
behaviour
and
“weigh-up”
the
situation
.


Put
bluntly
someone
whose
id
is
unchecked
would
cease
to
be
acceptable
in
society
and
find
themselves
physically
,
socially
and
emotionally
isolated
.


It
is
what
Freud
calls
the
“ego”
which
plays
this
policing
role
.



But
if
we
only
have
the
id
and
the
ego
then
it
is
unclear
why
we
would
not
simply
follow
the
pleasure
principle
.


That
is
,
although
the
ego
rationally
reflects
,
it
needs
something
to
weigh-up
against
the
id
.


We
need
some
authority
that
monitors
what
the
ego
is
doing
.


This
authority
is
what
Freud
calls
the
super-ego
.



Early
in
our
life
our
parents
(as
well
as
society
,
religious
leaders
etc
.

)
tell
us
what
we
can
and
cannot
do
and
chastise
us
for
breaking
rules
,
and
as
we
grow
older
we
internalize
these
things
and
“hear
them”
as
a
voice
of
authority
.


Imagine
that
your
mum
has
always
told
you
not
to
sit
with
your
elbows
on
the
table
then
you
internalize
this
rule
.


So
when
you
are
much
older
and
not
living
with
your
mum
any
longer
the
voice
of
your
“super-ego”
speaks
with
authority
—
“take
your
elbows
off
the
table
!

”
These
are
the
very
basics
of
Freud
structure
of
the
mind
.


Our
ego
balances
the
primal
drives
of
the
id
with
the
voice
of
authority
from
the
super-ego
.



Where
does
the
conscience
come
in
?


For
Freud
the
conscience
is
the
form
that
the
super-ego
takes
in
addressing
the
ego
.


When
the
internalized
authority
derived
from
parental
(social/religious)
rules
and
regulations
controls
the
ego
is
it
is
understood
as
“the
conscience”
.


In
our
last
example
it
is
our
“conscience”
that
tells
us
to
remove
our
elbows
from
the
table
.



Notice
then
that
our
conscience
often
requires
certain
things
from
us
which
we
fail
to
achieve
and
this
gives
rise
to
guilt
.


For
Freud
,
the
conscience
can
be
thought
of
as
synonymous
with
the
“guilty
conscience”
.


Our
ego
is
punished
through
guilt
by
the
form
of
the
super-ego
we
call
conscience
.


Furthermore
,
Freud
says
that
when
the
super-ego
fails
to
deal
properly
with
the
id
—
when
the
pleasure
principle
is
repressed
—
this
forms
what
he
calls
neurosis
.



You
can
also
hopefully
see
the
differences
between
Aquinas
and
Freud
.


First
,
the
obvious
point
is
that
for
Freud
the
conscience
is
not
the
voice
of
God
.


Second
,
unlike
Aquinas
,
Freud
thinks
that
the
conscience
could
be
bad
,
destructive
and
unhelpful
.


The
conscience
is
the
way
the
ego
experiences
the
authority
of
the
super-ego
.


But
the
super-ego
is
arrived
at
through
the
experiences
we
have
.


And
,
of
course
,
we
might
have
had
really
bad
experiences
growing
up
where
parents
are
stifling
,
overly
authoritarian
,
distant
,
cold
,
hard
,
violent
,
abusive
etc
.


In
these
sorts
of
cases
the
conscience
would
be
stifling
,
overly
authoritarian
,
distant
,
etc
.


This
means
that
although
Freud
does
not
think
we
can
,
or
should
,
get
rid
of
the
conscience
he
does
think
we
should
treat
it
with
a
healthy
dose
of
scepticism
and
hence
not
be
kowtowed
by
the
“guilt”
that
is
our
ego’s
punishment
for
falling
short
of
the
super-ego
;
conscience
is
the
product
of
our
often
non-ideal
upbringing
rather
than
a
divinely-inspired
force
for
good
.

Freud’s
Psychosexual
Development
Theory

Psychosexual
Development
Theory
is
a
theory
of
sexual
development
from
birth
to
death
.


Freud
was
the
first
thinker
to
look
at
the
entire
lifespan
in
terms
of
development
.


Freud
thought
that
as
we
develop
we
move
through
different
stages
.


At
each
stage
our
libido
(sex
drive)
is
focused
towards
different
things
.


If
we
fail
to
move
through
a
stage
completely
,
or
return
to
a
stage
,
then
problems
arise
and
we
might
become
fixated
with
the
area
associated
with
that
stage
.


This
can
be
a
serious
problem
for
our
relationships
and
could
be
an
underlying
cause
of
mental
illness
.



The
first
stage
is
the
oral
stage
from
birth
to
about
one
and
a
half
.


This
stage
is
where
babies
get
pleasure
through
putting
things
in
their
mouth
,
pleasure
in
biting
,
chewing
and
sucking
.


For
example
,
babies
soon
after
they
are
born
are
breastfeeding
and
as
the
baby
develops
they
navigate
and
explore
the
world
through
putting
things
in
their
mouth
.


Notice
that
during
this
phase
babies
are
very
dependent
on
others
.


According
to
Freud
at
this
stage
not
only
do
we
get
information
about
the
world
,
but
we
also
fulfil
the
id
.


Babies
who
can
bite
,
chew
and
such
as
much
as
they
want
are
being
guided
by
the
id
.


Freud
explains
behaviours
like
smoking
,
chewing
gum
,
overeating
,
with
failure
to
move
properly
through
this
stage
which
prevented
the
successful
development
of
the
id
.



The
next
stage
,
from
about
one
and
a
half
to
three
years
,
is
the
anal
stage
.


Here
pleasure
is
gained
through
controlling
going
to
the
toilet
.


This
stage
is
about
gaining
control
of
one’s
body
,
and
it
starts
with
controlling
the
bladder
and
bowels
(being
potty
trained)
.


It
is
around
this
time
that
the
ego
develops
.


This
control
of
their
bodies
is
a
source
of
pride
and
pleasure
for
children
.


Agents
who
fail
to
properly
move
through
this
stage
are
what
are
sometimes
called
“anally
retentive”
.


That
is
,
someone
who
is
overly
controlling
or
out
of
control
and
messy
,
because
—
according
to
Freud
—
they
do
not
want
to
let
go
of
their
waste
,
or
do
not
care
where
or
when
they
let
go
of
their
waste
.



The
next
phase
of
development
,
from
about
three
to
six
years
,
is
the
phallic
stage
in
which
a
child
discovers
one’s
genitals
,
and
importantly
that
they
are
different
in
men
and
women
.


This
stage
is
where
Freud
thinks
we
develop
the
Oedipus
and
the
Electra
complex
.


A
problematic
phallic
stage
will
cause
problems
with
intimacy
in
later
life
.



The
next
stage
,
the
latency
stage
,
is
from
six
years
to
the
onset
of
puberty
.


This
stage
is
not
about
pleasure
in
the
body
as
the
libido
is
“latent”
or
hidden
—
this
is
the
stage
where
sexual
desire
is
repressed
and
no
new
sexual
desires
emerge
.


At
this
stage
girls
play
with
girls
in
order
to
learn
the
role
of
a
girl
and
boys
play
with
boys
in
order
to
learn
about
the
role
of
boys
.


.


The
child
learns
how
to
navigate
the
social
world
.


A
difficult
latency
stage
leads
to
relational
problems
and
understanding
one’s
gender
.



The
libido
then
reappears
in
the
final
stage
which
lasts
to
our
death
and
which
Freud
calls
the
mature
genital
stage
.


This
is
where
the
individual
not
only
recognises
the
difference
between
men
and
women
but
also
shows
a
desire
to
engage
in
a
sexual
relationship
and
,
more
generally
,
a
pursuit
of
pleasure
and
happiness
.


People
become
sexually
active
,
fall
in
love
and
get
married
.


This
is
the
stage
where
we
acquire
a
fully
developed
conscience
.



SUMMARY

The
notion
of
“conscience”
has
appeared
for
thousands
of
years
in
different
cultures
,
even
though
it
has
not
always
been
called
“conscience”
.


Modern
Christian
orthodoxy
popularised
it
and
characterised
it
in
relation
to
God’s
voice
,
and
guidance
.


Aquinas
thought
that
conscience
is
the
way
we
understand
how
to
apply
what
we
know
.


In
Aquinas’s
view
,
our
conscience
is
fallible
and
might
guide
us
wrongly
.


When
our
conscience
“gets
it
wrong”
we
can
be
either
culpable
—
through
vincible
ignorance
—
or
not
culpable
—
through
invincible
ignorance
.



Freud
is
less
convinced
that
conscience
is
a
force
for
good
,
and
he
is
certain
that
it
has
not
got
anything
to
do
with
God
.


For
Freud
conscience
can
be
either
a
good
or
bad
.


We
can
think
of
our
mind
as
having
three
parts
,
the
id
,
ego
and
super-ego
.


The
conscience
for
Freud
is
the
form
the
super-ego
takes
when
it
is
trying
to
keep
the
ego
in
line
.


It
is
internalized
as
the
voice
of
authority
.


The
super-ego
is
about
following
rules
but
those
rules
do
not
come
from
“on
high”
,
they
derive
from
the
upbringing
we
have
had
.


So
if
we
have
had
a
repressive
upbringing
then
the
super-ego
—
the
voice
of
conscience
—
will
be
repressive
.


How
we
develop
these
three
features
of
the
mind
is
through
what
Freud
calls
Psychosexual
Development
;
if
we
do
not
develop
correctly
then
we
become
fixated
and
repressive
,
form
a
neurosis
and
ultimately
become
mentally
ill
.


Freud
thought
that
this
could
be
avoided
by
working
through
the
Psychosexual
Stages
in
the
normal
way
,
and
can
be
treated
through
psychosexual
counselling
.

conscience
,
a
personal
sense
of
the
moral
content
of
one’s
own
conduct
,
intentions
,
or
character
with
regard
to
a
feeling
of
obligation
to
do
right
or
be
good
.


Conscience
,
usually
informed
by
acculturation
and
instruction
,
is
thus
generally
understood
to
give
intuitively
authoritative
judgments
regarding
the
moral
quality
of
single
actions
.



Historically
,
almost
every
culture
has
recognized
the
existence
of
such
a
faculty
.


Ancient
Egyptians
,
for
example
,
were
urged
not
to
transgress
against
the
dictates
of
the
heart
,
for
one
“must
stand
in
fear
of
departing
from
its
guidance
.

”
In
some
belief
systems
,
conscience
is
regarded
as
the
voice
of
God
and
therefore
a
completely
reliable
guide
of
conduct
:
among
the
Hindus
it
is
considered
“the
invisible
God
who
dwells
within
us
.

”
Among
Western
religious
groups
,
the
Society
of
Friends
(or
Quakers)
places
particular
emphasis
on
the
role
of
conscience
in
apprehending
and
responding
through
conduct
to
the
“Inner
Light”
of
God
.



Outside
the
context
of
religion
,
philosophers
,
social
scientists
,
and
psychologists
have
sought
to
understand
conscience
in
both
its
individual
and
universal
aspects
.


The
view
that
holds
conscience
to
be
an
innate
,
intuitive
faculty
determining
the
perception
of
right
and
wrong
is
called
intuitionism
.


The
view
that
holds
conscience
to
be
a
cumulative
and
subjective
inference
from
past
experience
giving
direction
to
future
conduct
is
called
empiricism
.


The
behavioral
scientist
,
on
the
other
hand
,
may
view
the
conscience
as
a
set
of
learned
responses
to
particular
social
stimuli
.


Another
explanation
of
conscience
was
put
forth
in
the
20th
century
by
Sigmund
Freud
in
his
postulation
of
the
superego
.


According
to
Freud
,
the
superego
is
a
major
element
of
personality
that
is
formed
by
the
child’s
incorporation
of
moral
values
through
parental
approval
or
punishment
.


The
resulting
internalized
set
of
prohibitions
,
condemnations
,
and
inhibitions
is
that
part
of
the
superego
known
as
conscience
.

“Conscious

and

“Conscientious”

Explaining
The
Difference
Between
“Conscience
,”
“Conscious

and
“Conscientious”

powered
by
LanguageTool

“Conscience”
and
“conscious”
both
relate
to
the
mind
,
but
what
about
“conscientious”
?


This
blog
post
will
teach
you
the
difference
between
these
three
commonly
confused
words
.



[(What
does
conscious
mean
?


What
does
conscience
mean
?


What
does
conscientious
mean
?

)]

Do
you
know
the
difference
between
these
three
words
?



-
Conscience
is
a
noun
that
means
“an
inner
feeling
or
voice
that

tells
you
whether
your
actions
are
right
or
wrong
.

”
-
Conscious
is
an
adjective
that
means
“aware
of
and
responding
to

one’s
surroundings
.

”
-
Conscientious
is
an
adjective
that
means
“wishing
to
do
what
is

right
,
especially
to
do
one’s
work
or
duty
well
and
thoroughly
.

”

In
the
English
language
,
there
are
many
words
and
phrases
that
can
be
interchanged
,
such
as
despite
and
in
spite
of
.


The
words
conscience
,
conscious
,
and
conscientious
do
not
fall
under
this
category
.


They
look
similar
,
but
they
have
three
distinct
definitions
.


Below
,
we’ll
go
over
what
each
word
means
and
prove
example
sentences
.



------------------------------------------------------------------------


What
Does
“Conscience”
Mean
?



Conscience
/ˈkɑːnʃəns/
is
a
noun
that
refers
to
the
“inner
feeling
or
voice
that
tells
us
what
is
morally
right
or
wrong
and
impels
us
towards
right
action
.

”


I
advised
my
niece
to
let
her
conscience
guide
her
.



When
someone
has
a
guilty
conscience
,
it
means
that
“they
feel
guilty
about
something
they
did
that
they
perceive
as
wrong
.

”


My
guilty
conscience
kept
me
up
all
night
.



On
the
opposite
side
of
the
spectrum
,
when
someone
has
a
clear
conscience
,
they
feel
that
they
did
the
right
thing
and
therefore
feel
no
guilt
.




My
conscience
was
clear
because
I
knew
I
did
the
right
thing
.



------------------------------------------------------------------------

What
Does
“Conscious”
Mean
?



Conscious
/ˈkɑːnʃəs/
is
an
adjective
that
means
“aware
of
and
responding
to
one’s
surroundings
;
awake
.

”


When
she
fell
,
she
hit
her
head
really
hard
,
but
luckily
,
she
remained

conscious
.



When
one
is
unconscious
,
it
means
that
they
are
not
conscious
,
so
they
are
“without
awareness
,
sensation
,
or
cognition
.

”


My
sister
was
unconscious
for
three
days
after
the
accident
.



Conscious
can
also
mean
“being
acutely
and
painfully
aware
of
,”
or
“sensitive
to
.

”


He
is
conscious
of
his
weight
gain
.



When
using
conscious
in
this
respect
,
the
opposite
is
not
unconscious
.


In
other
words
,
if
someone
is
oblivious
or
unbothered
by
their
weight
gain
,
you
wouldn’t
say
“He
is
unconscious
about
his
weight
gain
.

”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What
Does
“Conscientious”
Mean
?



Conscientious
/ˌkɑːnʃiˈenʃəs/
is
an
adjective
commonly
used
to
describe
someone
who
“takes
care
to
do
things
carefully
and
correctly
.

”


She
was
a
conscientious
student
and
graduated
at
the
top
of
her
class
.



Conscientious
also
refers
to
“being
governed
by
conscience
to
do
what’s
right
.

”


He
is
a
conscientious
lawyer
who
does
not
let
outside
sources
stop
him

from
doing
what
is
morally
right
.

Conscience

Your
individual
conscience
is
the
final
arbiter
of
what
is
right
or
wrong
.



“The
church
,
your
parents
,
grandma
,
no
one
has
the
right
to
suggest
that
your
conscience
is
wrong
or
that
your
conscience
makes
you
a
bad
Catholic
.

”

Kate
Ott

Assistant
Professor
of
Christian
Social
Ethics
,
Drew
University
Theological
School

Our
conscience
can
be
described
as
our
knowledge
of
ourselves
,
our
awareness
of
the
moral
principles
we
are
committed
to
,
and
our
motivation
to
act
.



One
of
the
most
fundamental
teachings
in
the
Catholic
tradition
is
the
primacy
of
conscience
.


This
doctrine
states
that
Catholics
must
use
their
reason
to
discern
ethically
complex
situations
and
that
our
individual
consciences
should
be
the
final
arbiter
in
all
moral
decision-making
.



The
Catechism
of
the
Catholic
Church
states
that
we
have
the
right
to
act
in
conscience
and
in
freedom
to
make
moral
decisions
and
that
no
one
should
be
forced
to
act
contrary
to
their
consciences
.



As
Catholics
,
we
believe
that
we
must
use
all
of
the
resources
available
to
us
to
form
our
consciences
so
that
we
can
make
the
best
possible
decisions
for
ourselves
,
particularly
in
morally
complex
circumstances
.


We
believe
this
is
particularly
essential
when
making
choices
regarding
sexual
and
reproductive
health
.



Catholics
for
Choice
fights
for
the
rights
of
all
individuals
to
make
decisions
regarding
sexual
and
reproductive
health
based
on
their
own
consciences
.


But
we
are
conscious
of
the
fact
that
poverty
,
racism
and
other
forms
of
powerlessness
often
limit
the
possibility
of
using
one’s
conscience
.


For
this
reason
,
we
also
strive
to
dismantle
the
structures
of
injustice
that
force
people
into
situations
in
which
they
have
few
,
if
any
,
choices
.

Questions
about
Conscience

We
'
ve
compiled
these
talking
points
to
help
inform
Catholic
conversations
about
conscience
.



What
is
a
conscience
?



Our
conscience
is
our
capacity
to
judge
right
from
wrong
and
good
from
evil
.


It
is
an
internal
moral
compass
that
seeks
truth
and
wisdom
to
guide
own
behavior
and
decisions
.


One’s
conscience
draws
upon
moral
codes
that
come
from
religion
and
society
,
as
well
as
one’s
internal
belief
systems
and
personal
values
.



What
factors
inform
your
conscience
?



Many
factors
form
one’s
conscience
.


They
include
the
wisdom
of
one’s
religious
tradition
,
of
course
.


But
a
well-formed
conscience
also
incorporates
knowledge
from
other
sources
,
such
as
science
,
medicine
,
ethical
frameworks
and
our
own
experience
.



Are
there
limits
on
the
ways
in
which
we
can
use
our
conscience
?



One’s
individual
conscience
should
always
be
the
ultimate
authority
in
all
moral
decision-making
.


However
,
sinful
structures
of
gender
inequality
,
systemic
racism
,
economic
insecurity
and
immigration
status
can
limit
one’s
ability
to
make
choices
.


The
ability
to
use
one’s
conscience
and
make
choices
is
too
often
a
luxury
enjoyed
by
those
who
are
wealthy
,
white
and
privileged
.


As
Catholics
committed
to
a
rich
tradition
of
social
justice
teachings
,
we
must
dismantle
the
injustices
that
prevent
people
from
being
able
to
exercise
their
consciences
and
make
choices
for
themselves
.

Insights

Making
choices
in
your
own
good
conscience
begins
with
being
informed

Everyone
Has
a
Purpose
,
Few
Have
a
Conscience

[Everyone
Has
a
Purpose
,
Few
Have
a
Conscience]

Purpose
is
the
raison
d’être
of
a
company
,
the
permanent
basis
of
its
strategy
.


Every
company
has
a
purpose
,
explicit
or
not
;
however
,
few
–
although
this
is
changing
–
have
a
conscience
.


To
be
clear
,
the
Mafia
has
a
purpose
,
but
consciousness
is
just
another
story
.



Let’s
start
with
this
Litmus
test
:
“Who
said
this
statement
?

”

To
start
off
relaxed
,
I’d
like
to
invite
you
to
play
and
take
part
in
this
riddle
with
three
possible
answers
,
although
only
one
of
them
is
the
right
one
.



The
question
is
:
Who
has
explicitly
told
this
institutional
purpose
?



The
purpose
under
scrutiny
is
:

“Caring
for
those
around
us
,
always
ensuring
their
well-being
and
that
of
their
families
,
for
a
lifetime
.



Protecting
our
environment
,
taking
care
of
raw
materials
,
giving
security
to
producers
,
recycling
our
waste
.

”

The
potential
answers
are
:

1
.


Paulus
“Paul”
Gerardus
Josephus
Maria
Polman
,
Former
CEO
of

Unilever
;
2
.


Pope
Francis
,
266th
Pope
of
the
Catholic
Church
;
3
.


Anthony
“Tony”
John
Soprano
Sr
.


,
Capo
di
tutti
Capi
–
From
The

Sopranos
crime
drama
TV
series
.



[]

Credit
:
CoWomen

Before
giving
the
right
answer
,
we
must
admit
that
all
three
could
have
said
that
quote
,
one
talking
about
the
Unilever
raison
d’être
,
Pope
Francis
in
his
second
encyclical
,
Laudato
si’
,
and
we
are
left
with
Tony
Soprano
whom
you
probably
know
,
I
guess
.



And
the
correct
choice
is
the
number
“3”
.


Words
more
or
words
least
,
this
was
the
way
Tony
Soprano
described
to
his
psychologist
the
business
he
was
in
and
leading
.



By
this
,
what
I
mean
is
that
everyone
has
a
purpose
,
even
the
Mafia
,
yet
few
have
a
conscience
and
even
fewer
are
specific
in
the
way
they
define
it
.



Consciousness
needs
sincerity
rather
than
authenticity

For
a
company
,
being
true
to
itself
means
being
concerned
,
admitting
vulnerability
,
and
making
bold
choices
.


For
example
,
stopping
collaborating
with
other
firms
that
do
not
meet
a
company’s
standards
of
conduct
;
assuming
responsibility
for
mistakes
that
affect
society
;
abandoning
businesses
that
are
no
longer
legitimate
.


In
other
words
,
being
consistent
between
what
the
company
thinks
,
does
,
and
says
.



Behaving
truthfully
and
being
unapologetically
driven
by
values
are
two
of
the
essential
characteristics
that
today’s
society
is
demanding
from
each
institution
.



SEE
ALSO
:A
Better
Future
,
Finale
–
Advertisers’
Total
Commitment
to
People
and
Communities

The
key
difference
between
being
authentic
and
sincere
is
that
a
business
can
be
authentic
and
behave
without
a
sense
of
morality
or
ethics
,
while
it
is
impossible
to
think
of
a
sincere
company
behaving
in
that
way
.



On
the
one
hand
,
we
all
have
examples
of
rude
,
unresponsive
,
and
abusive
companies
that
are
authentic
but
are
seldom
true
to
themselves
and
conscious
of
others
.


On
the
other
hand
,
sincerity
is
about
recognizing
that
the
company
lives
in
a
world
that
goes
beyond
its
own
borders
.


It
is
about
deeply
considering
its
impact
on
the
planet
,
being
self-conscious
,
purposeful
,
and
going
beyond
the
numbers
to
confirm
and
express
its
true
nature
.


Being
sincere
means
knowing
that
there
is
a
pathway
to
live
and
work
by
its
values
,
down
to
every
detail
.


In
this
way
,
a
company
can
become
a
genuine
and
inspiring
brand
.

Authenticity
and
sincerity…
Capisci
?



Another
important
issue
to
consider
is
that
authenticity
is
an
innate
behavior
and
sincerity
is
an
acquired
one
.



Babies
are
authentic
,
kids
learn
to
behave
sincerely
.


The
same
can
happen
with
companies
.



Business
authenticity
is
a
broader
definition
that
considers
the
entire
spectrum
of
being
true
to
itself
,
while
sincerity
is
more
focused
,
brings
wisdom
,
care
,
and
a
greater
perspective
than
its
own
.



People
believe
in
honest
brands

It
is
good
business
to
be
true
to
what
the
company
is
,
allowing
the
public
to
recognize
how
it
behaves
with
a
conscience
.


Although
,
in
addition
,
society
demands
a
positive
social
and
environmental
impact
from
the
company
,
this
does
not
mean
that
profit
motives
(which
are
necessary)
are
hidden
as
a
falsely
sincere
attitude
.



It
is
valid
to
recognize
the
need
to
“make
money”
whilst
being
sympathetic
to
the
audience
in
the
way
a
company
communicates
.


That’s
sincerity
!



Brands
trying
to
navigate
this
new
world
of
conscience
and
sincerity
should
act
differently
,
deeply
believing
in
the
way
they
think
,
in
the
values
they
defend
,
doing
the
right
thing
,
and
being
honest
about
their
motivations
.




“Behaving
truthfully
and
being
unapologetically
driven
by
values
are

two
of
the
essential
characteristics
that
today’s
society
is
demanding

from
each
institution
.

”

If
being
honest
and
conscious
brings
on
a
deeper
layer
of
seriousness
and
respect
,
being
conscious
of
others
helps
take
it
to
the
next
level
,
one
that
is
increasingly
demanded
by
all
stakeholders
including
citizens
.



“Is
your
company
radically
honest
?


”
I
asked
him
.


“Of
course
,
it
is
!


We’ve
always
been
honest
,”
he
lied
to
me
.



Conscientious
purpose
is
an
inherent
part
of
business

From
the
beginning
of
time
,
purpose
is
born
with
any
enterprise
expressing
its
raison
d’être
–
even
Adam
,
Eve
,
Lilith
,
and
the
apple
.



Thus
,
the
purpose
must
be
company-connected
,
and
its
fit
is
achieved
because
the
strategic
aims
are
born
from
and
aligned
with
such
business
.

Brands
Can
Put
Purpose
at
the
Heart
of
Their

The
challenge
for
the
leadership
team
is
to
first
understand
the
real
and
deepest
meaning
of
purpose
,
translating
it
into
an
actionable
mission
and
vision
.


It
is
a
matter
of
alignment
,
coherence
,
and
consistency
.



These
are
the
basis
of
a
company’s
better
performance
,
not
only
in
terms
of
achieving
better
economic
and
financial
results
but
also
in
generating
a
positive
impact
.



A
conscientious
purpose
must
be
integrated
into
all
aspects
of
how
companies
do
business
.



As
life
,
purpose
is
understood
backwards
;
but
it
must
be
lived
forwards
.


This
means
that
,
if
purpose
changes
,
the
company
must
change
–
essentially
,
because
it
must
be
reimagined
,
redesigned
,
and
restarted
to
live
a
new
aspirational
future
.


This
is
a
key
point
that
is
often
misunderstood
.



Making
a
conscientious
purpose
explicit
is
a
good
first
step

To
be
practical
,
a
good
first
step
is
to
make
the
purpose
explicit
and
,
if
it
is
already
there
,
to
ensure
that
it
really
is
the
reason
for
the
company’s
existence
and
not
a
good
narrative
invented
by
the
marketing
or
communication
areas
.



“Holy
Graf
Zeppelin
,
Batman
!

”
Unfortunately
,
we
tend
to
produce
such
conceptual
monstrosities
far
too
often
.


Deal
with
it
!


If
the
purpose
of
the
business
is
only
to
make
money
,
that’s
what
it
is
!


As
mentioned
before
,
it
can
change
but
it
will
imply
that
a
new
business
was
born
.

To
reinforce
,
deepen
,
and
,
above
all
,
be
driven
by
a
purpose
,
in
addition
to
making
it
explicit
,
companies
must
continuously
translate
it
into
precise
business
objectives
associated
with
it
and
,
in
turn
,
the
latter
must
be
translated
into
visible
actions
and
behaviors
.


This
ensures
executive
responsiveness
to
the
company’s
key
audiences
and
becomes
the
trigger
for
exceptional
transformation
and
growth
.



The
obvious
steps
(sorry
,
but
I
must
insist
on
this)
to
make
purpose
a
meaningful
day-to-day
experience
are
:

-
Think
,
act
,
and
say
–
in
that
order
;
-
Measure
the
impact
of
how
the
company
acts
on
purpose
;
-
Make
the
leadership
team
accountable
;
-
Ensure
that
all
stakeholders
understand
and
share
that
company’s

reason
for
existence
;
-
Build
the
company’s
symbols
,
rituals
,
and
stories
around
it
.



Brand
and
purpose
,
brands
with
a
conscience

Branding
aims
at
building
a
realistic
meaning
of
the
company
in
its
interaction
with
people
,
independently
but
including
the
role
they
play
as
citizens
.



In
addition
,
when
the
purpose
includes
the
impact
on
society
and
the
environment
,
the
brand
as
a
business
platform
helps
prove
the
consciousness
of
the
company
,
not
to
mention
internal
issues
of
governance
and
responsible
investments
.



When
stakeholders
understand
,
live
,
and
share
what
the
company
stands
for
and
why
that
matters
,
the
results
come
on
their
own
,
without
out
of
the
ordinary
efforts
.


That’s
why
I
said
,
at
the
very
beginning
of
this
article
,
that
companies
that
act
in
line
with
their
purpose
create
value
,
generate
superior
results
,
and
could
even
have
a
positive
impact
.

If
the
company
can’t
deliver
on
purpose
,
its
brand
promise
is
basically
empty
nonsense
.



Three
questions
arise
:

-
Where
are
your
company
and
your
brand
on
this
journey
towards
brands

with
a
conscience
?


-
Is
the
company’s
purpose
explicit
and
does
it
need
to
be

transformed
?


-
Is
the
company
ready
for
a
transformation
that
will
lead
to
growth

into
both
results
and
impact
?

[What
Is
Freedom
of
Conscience
,
and
Why
Does
It
Matter
?

]

What
is
“conscience”
?


It’s
a
word
we’re
all
familiar
with—a
clear
conscience
,
a
guilty
conscience—even
if
we
can’t
pinpoint
an
exact
definition
.



The
concept
pops
up
in
all
kinds
of
places
.


In
Saturday
morning
cartoons
where
good
guys
consult
an
angel
on
their
right
shoulder
(conscience)
and
a
devil
on
their
left
shoulder
(temptation)
before
making
a
decision
.


In
literary
masterpieces
like
Crime
and
Punishment
,
where
the
main
character
suffers
from
overwhelming
guilt
after
committing
a
crime
.


And
in
popular
movies
like
Star
Wars
where
Darth
Vader
chooses
to
do
one
final
good
act
after
a
lifetime
of
evil
.



But
none
of
these
examples
capture
the
full
concept
of
conscience
.


As
Americans
,
we
should
consider
the
true
meaning
of
“conscience
.

”
We
should
also
recognize
the
importance—and
privilege—of
having
the
freedom
of
conscience
.


America
was
founded
on
this
freedom
.


And
it’s
worth
preserving
today
.



Read
on
to
find
out
why
.



What
is
freedom
of
conscience
?



Conscience
is
our
God-given
ability
to
discern
right
from
wrong
,
good
from
evil
.


But
it’s
more
than
that
.


For
knowing
right
from
wrong
wouldn’t
do
much
good
if
we
didn’t
(or
couldn’t)
act
on
what’s
right
.


So
conscience
also
includes
the
ability
to
apply
laws
,
rules
,
and
intuitions
in
the
right
way
.


In
other
words
,
to
act
on
what
we
believe
.



[A
rural
church
is
seen
in
a
field]

The
First
Amendment
protects
our
public
witness
.


We
can
put
our
faith
in
action
by
serving
others
.



Where
is
freedom
of
conscience
found
in
the
Constitution
?



America’s
Founders
understood
the
gravity
of
protecting
the
freedom
of
conscience
.



James
Madison
called
conscience
“the
most
sacred
of
all
property
.

”
Thomas
Jefferson
said
that
no
“provision
in
our
constitution
ought
to
be
dearer
to
man
,
than
that
which
protects
the
rights
of
conscience
against”
the
government
.


And
during
the
debate
over
what
would
become
the
First
Amendment
,
many
lawmakers
proposed
protecting
the
rights
of
conscience
.



This
understanding
shaped
the
First
Amendment
.


Although
the
amendment
doesn’t
explicitly
mention
“conscience
,”
it
protects
its
animating
features
:
religious
freedom
and
free
speech
.


The
First
Amendment
says
,
“Congress
shall
make
no
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion
,
or
prohibiting
the
free
exercise
thereof
;
or
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech
,
or
of
the
press
.

”

Why
is
freedom
of
conscience
important
?



These
26
words
protect
the
freedom
of
conscience—the
freedom
to
believe
without
coercion
and
to
speak
and
act
consistently
with
those
beliefs
.



That
freedom
begins
internally
:
the
government
cannot
force
us
to
act
contrary
to
our
beliefs
,
believe
what
we
otherwise
wouldn’t
,
or
to
say
things
to
which
we
object
.


So
we
have
the
freedom
to
think
,
reason
,
speak
,
stay
silent
about
,
and
hold
certain
beliefs
without
fearing
government
punishment
.


That
protects
our
private
conscience
.



But
our
internal
beliefs
often
move
us
to
act
publicly
.


So
the
First
Amendment
also
protects
our
public
witness
.


We
can
put
our
faith
in
action
by
serving
others
.


We
can
try
to
persuade
others
of
our
views
by
publicly
expressing
them
.


And
we
can
join
communities
of
people—like
churches
,
nonprofits
,
and
other
associations—that
share
our
beliefs
.



The
First
Amendment
also
protects
the
freedom
to
act
in
several
ways
.


Religious
freedom
ensures
a
private
sphere
within
which
religious
bodies
may
govern
themselves
and
instruct
their
congregants
according
to
their
own
beliefs
.


That
freedom
preserves
the
integrity
of
those
beliefs
for
future
generations
.



And
the
freedom
of
speech
recognizes
that
voices
are
often
louder
when
expressed
together
.


So
we
can
join
with
like-minded
people
to
amplify
the
messages
and
values
we
want
to
promote
.



It
may
be
easy
to
take
these
freedoms
for
granted
.


But
not
every
country
has
them
.


Consider
France
,
a
country
that
generally
discourages
acts
and
symbols
of
faith
in
the
public
sphere
.


There
,
for
example
,
Muslim
girls
cannot
wear
religious
head
coverings
in
school
,
but
other
girls
can
wear
head
scarfs
for
fashion
.


In
France
,
that’s
laïcité
.


In
America
,
that’s
religious
discrimination
.



The
freedom
to
act
on
our
beliefs
is
important
because
community
standards—or
lack
thereof—reflect
individuals’
conscience
.


The
more
we
train
our
conscience
to
do
what
is
right
,
the
better
off
we
will
be
.


But
we
lose
our
ability
to
discern
right
from
wrong
the
more
we
consistently
ignore
our
conscience
.



The
freedom
of
conscience
has
also
benefitted
America’s
common
good
.


Because
of
this
freedom
,
religious
organizations
have
founded
and
currently
operate
countless
hospitals
,
homeless
shelters
,
adoption
agencies
,
community
centers
,
and
other
public
services
.


Pastors
have
condemned
social
ills
like
racism
and
violence
.


And
religious
people
are
more
likely
to
volunteer
their
time
and
contribute
their
money
to
all
sorts
of
charitable
causes
(religious
and
secular
alike)
.

Smith
at

Supreme
Court
.



What
are
some
court
cases
dealing
with
freedom
of
conscience
?



The
freedom
of
conscience
is
worth
preserving
.


Several
court
cases
seek
to
do
(and
have
done)
just
that
.


Consider
three
contexts
:

1
.


The
freedom
of
artists
to
speak
according
to
their
beliefs
.



2
.


The
freedom
of
medical
providers
to
decline
to
provide
medical
procedures
that
violate
their
conscience
.



3
.


The
freedom
of
faith-based
public-service
ministries
to
operate
in
line
with
their
religious
purpose
.



Freedom
of
conscience
for
artists

For
almost
eighty
years
,
the
U
.

S
.


Supreme
Court
has
recognized
that
compelling
someone
to
express
a
message
they
disagree
with
is
unconstitutional
.


Even
so
,
artists
are
still
being
threatened
today
for
declining
to
convey
ideas
that
violate
their
beliefs
.



For
example
,
Jack
Phillips
of
Masterpiece
Cakeshop
has
been
targeted
three
times
for
declining
to
create
custom
cakes
that
promote
ideas
about
human
sexuality
that
he
doesn’t
believe
.


Jack’s
first
case
ended
in
a
major
victory
at
the
U
.

S
.


Supreme
Court
.


More
recently
,
Jack
won
another
victory
when
the
Colorado
Supreme
Court
dismissed
a
lawsuit
brought
against
him
.



ADF
also
represented

artist

Supreme
Court
in
303
Creative

Elenis

Lorie

She

original

she’s
passionate
about

promoting
messages
that
contradict
her
beliefs
about
marriage
.


Unwilling
to
violate
the
law
or
her
conscience
,
Lorie
challenged
the
law
to
protect
the
cherished
freedom
to
speak
consistently
with
her
religious
views
on
marriage
.

 

In
June
2023
,
the
Supreme
Court
ruled
that
Colorado
could
not
use
its
law
to
coerce
Lorie
to
express
a
message
that
violated
her
beliefs
.


The
Court
said
that
the
First
Amendment
protects
Lorie’s
freedom
to
decide
which
messages
she
wants
to
express
,
and
that
includes
the
freedom
to
design
wedding
websites
consistent
with
her
religious
beliefs
about
marriage
.



Elsewhere
across
the
country
,
artists
as
diverse
as
florists
and
custom
print
shops
have
been
forced
to
choose
between
their
faith
and
their
craft
,
just
as
Colorado
tried
to
force
Lorie
to
do
.


But
fortunately
,
the
First
Amendment
makes
that
choice
a
false
dichotomy
.



Following
the
First
Amendment
,
courts
have
protected
the
freedoms
of
filmmakers
,
calligraphers
,
and
a
photographer
to
create
artwork
proclaiming
their
views
on
marriage
.


Another
court
likewise
ensured
that
a
Christian
philosophy
professor
could
talk
about
gender
identity
consistent
with
his
belief
about
the
immutability
of
sex
.


Lorie’s
victory
reaffirms
that
the
Supreme
Court
still
believes
in
the
importance
of
a
free
conscience
.


That’s
how
it
should
be
.


Every
American
has
the
right
to
speak
freely
.


That’s
why
Lorie
found
support
from
a
diverse
group
of
artists—from
a
world-renowned
graphic
designer
to
a
Christian
tattoo
artist
,
a
Muslim
wedding
photographer
,
and
a
cake
artist
who
hold
different
views
about
marriage
.



Freedom
of
conscience
for
health-care
professionals

Beyond
speech
,
the
freedom
of
conscience
is
imperative
in
the
medical
field
.


Since
ancient
times
,
physicians
have
sworn
to
“do
no
harm”
to
their
patients
.


Fast
forward
to
present
day
,
and
professional
medical
ethics
acknowledge
the
rights
of
professionals
to
decline
to
provide
medical
treatment
that
violates
their
conscience
.



The
justification
echoes
the
First
Amendment—to
preserve
the
personal
integrity
of
the
medical
provider
and
the
overall
integrity
of
the
medical
profession
.


But
not
everyone
sees
it
that
way
.



In
Christian
Healthcare
Centers
v
.


Nessel
,
for
example
,
ADF
represents
a
Michigan
faith-based
medical
nonprofit
organization
that
provides
high-quality
health
care
to
all
and
offers
substantially
reduced
prices
for
patients
with
lower
incomes
.


But
a
Michigan
law
requires
Christian
Healthcare
to
prescribe
cross-sex
hormones
to
facilitate
efforts
to
alter
a
patient’s
biological
sex
.


Doing
so
violates
the
ministry’s
religious
beliefs
and
undermines
its
ability
to
provide
safe
health
care
to
its
community
.


So
the
ministry
challenged
the
law
to
safeguard
its
freedom
to
operate
consistent
with
its
beliefs
.



Likewise
,
in
State
of
Texas
and
Mayo
Pharmacy
v
.


HHS
,
ADF
represents
Mayo
Pharmacy
,
a
pharmacy
in
North
Dakota
that
practices
consistent
with
its
Catholic
faith
.


The
pharmacy
is
challenging
a
regulation
that
requires
it
to
dispense
drugs
prescribed
to
induce
abortions
against
its
religious
convictions
.


In
July
2023
,
a
federal
district
court
ruled
that
the
case
must
proceed
.



Freedom
of
conscience
for
faith-based
ministries

The
freedom
of
conscience
allows
faith-based
ministries
to
provide
other
public
services
to
care
for
the
most
vulnerable
among
us
.


For
example
,
ADF
has
twice
defended
Downtown
Hope
Center
,
a
Christian
nonprofit
organization
in
Anchorage
,
Alaska
.


The
Hope
Center
offers
meals
,
job
training
,
and
clothing
for
homeless
men
and
women
and
serves
as
an
overnight
shelter
for
women—many
of
whom
are
trying
to
escape
from
abusive
situations
and
even
from
sex
trafficking
.



And
ADF
represented
New
Hope
Family
Services
in
New
York
.


For
almost
sixty
years
,
New
Hope
has
helped
to
place
more
than
1
,000
children
into
loving
adoptive
homes
throughout
the
state
.


It
does
so
because
of
its
religious
conviction
that
Christians
are
called
to
look
after
the
needy—especially
children
.


A
court
recently
protected
New
Hope’s
ability
to
continue
to
care
for
these
children
and
their
families
according
to
its
religious
beliefs
.



These
ministries
provide
critical
services
to
their
communities
.


And
they
do
so
because
of
their
religious
beliefs
.


This
is
a
common
feature
of
American
history
made
possible
by
the
freedom
of
conscience
.


In
that
way
,
protecting
the
ability
of
these
ministries
to
live
out
their
faith
ensures
that
other
religious
organizations
can
do
the
same
while
contributing
to
the
common
good
.



Conclusion

By
now
,
we’ve
answered
the
original
question—what
is
conscience
?


And
we’ve
answered
another—
why
is
freedom
of
conscience
worth
preserving
?



In
the
end
,
this
freedom
recognizes
the
inherent
dignity
of
each
person
as
created
in
God’s
image
and
endowed
with
the
God-given
capacity
to
make
moral
judgments
.


We
all
benefit
from
that
freedom
.

"Deep

which

Its

From
Wikipedia
,
the
free
encyclopedia

This
article
is
about
the
conscience
clause
in
medicine
.


For
the
conscience
clause
in
the
19th
century
English
educational
system
,
see
Conscience
clause
(education)
.



Conscience
clauses
are
legal
clauses
attached
to
laws
in
some
parts
of
the
United
States
and
other
countries
which
permit
pharmacists
,
physicians
,
and/or
other
providers
of
health
care
not
to
provide
certain
medical
services
for
reasons
of
religion
or
conscience
.


It
can
also
involve
parents
withholding
consenting
for
particular
treatments
for
their
children
.

^([1])

In
many
cases
,
the
clauses
also
permit
health
care
providers
to
refuse
to
refer
patients
to
unopposed
providers
.


Those
who
choose
not
to
refer
or
provide
services
may
not
be
disciplined
or
discriminated
against
.


The
provision
is
most
frequently
enacted
in
connection
with
issues
relating
to
reproduction
,
such
as
abortion
(see
conscientious
objection
to
abortion)
,
sterilization
,
contraception
,
and
stem
cell
based
treatments
,
but
may
include
any
phase
of
patient
care
.

^([2])

History

[edit]

[]

Inside
drawer
to
Senator
Frank
Church
'
s
(D-ID)
senate
desk

The
earliest
national
conscience
clause
law
in
the
United
States
,
which
was
enacted
immediately
following
the
Supreme
Court
'
s
decision
in
Roe
v
.


Wade
,
applied
only
to
abortion
and
sterilization
.


It
was
sponsored
by
Senator
Frank
Church
of
Idaho
.

^([3])
The
Church
Amendment
of
1973
,
passed
by
the
Senate
on
a
vote
of
92–1
,
exempted
private
hospitals
receiving
federal
funds
under
the
Hill-Burton
Act
,
Medicare
and
Medicaid
from
any
requirement
to
provide
abortions
or
sterilizations
when
they
objected
on
“the
basis
of
religious
beliefs
or
moral
convictions
.

”
Nearly
every
state
enacted
similar
legislation
by
the
end
of
the
decade—often
with
the
support
of
legislators
who
otherwise
supported
abortion
rights
.


Supreme
Court
Justice
Harry
Blackmun
,
the
author
of
the
Roe
v
.


Wade
majority
opinion
,
endorsed
such
clauses
“appropriate
protection”
for
individual
physicians
and
denominational
hospitals
.

^([4])

According
to
Nancy
Berlinger
,
of
the
bioethics
research
institute
The
Hastings
Center
,
"
.


.


.

Conscientious
objection
in
health
care
always
has
a
social
dimension
and
.


.


.

Laws
and
professional
guidelines
on
conscientious
objection
in
health
care
must
balance
the
respect
for
an
individual’s
beliefs
against
the
well-being
of
the
general
public
.

"^([1])

Conscience
clauses
have
been
adopted
by
a
number
of
U
.

S
.


states
.


including
Arkansas
,
Illinois
,
Indiana
,
Iowa
,
Kansas
,
Kentucky
,
Louisiana
,
Maine
,
Maryland
,
Massachusetts
,
Michigan
,
Mississippi
,
Pennsylvania
,
and
South
Dakota
.


There
are
some
recent
comprehensive
reviews
of
federal
and
state
conscience
clause
laws
across
the
United
States
and
in
select
other
countries
.

^([5])

Some
clauses
address
local
concerns
:
Oregon
,
recognizes
a
physician
'
s
right
to
refuse
to
participate
in
physician-assisted
suicide
,
although
it
is
legal
in
that
state
.

^([1])

Informed
consent

[edit]

An
informed
consent
clause
,
although
allowing
medical
professionals
not
to
perform
procedures
against
their
conscience
,
does
not
allow
professionals
to
give
fraudulent
information
to
deter
a
patient
from
obtaining
such
a
procedure
(such
as
lying
about
the
risks
involved
in
an
abortion
to
deter
one
from
obtaining
one)
in
order
to
impose
one
'
s
belief
using
deception
.


These
principles
were
reaffirmed
in
the
Utah
Supreme
Court
'
s
decision
in
Wood
v
.


University
of
Utah
Medical
Center
(2002)
.

^([6])
Commenting
on
the
case
,
bioethicist
Jacob
Appel
of
New
York
University
wrote
that
"if
only
a
small
number
of
physicians
intentionally
or
negligently
withhold
information
from
their
patients
significant
damage
is
done
to
the
medical
profession
as
a
whole"
because
"pregnant
women
will
no
longer
know
whether
to
trust
their
doctors
.

"^([7])

Right
of
Conscience
Rule

[edit]

The
Right
of
Conscience
Rule
was
a
set
of
protections
for
healthcare
workers
enacted
by
President
George
W
.


Bush
on
December
18
,
2008
,
allowing
healthcare
workers
to
refuse
care
based
on
their
personal
beliefs
.

^([8])
Specifically
,
the
rule
denied
federal
funding
to
institutions
that
did

allow
workers
to
refuse
care
that
went
against
their
beliefs
.


In
February
2011
,
President
Barack
Obama
rescinded
the
Right
of
Conscience
Rule
.

^([9][10])

Pharmacists

[edit]

States
have
historically
provided
a
conscience
clause
right
allowing
pharmacists
to
refrain
from
participating
in
abortions
.

^([11])
In
April
2005
,
Governor
Rod
Blagojevich
by
emergency
executive
order
required
all
pharmacists
to
provide
Plan
B
levonorgestrel
.


In
September
2012
,
the
Illinois
Appellate
Court
found
the
Governor
'
s
order
violated
Illinois
law
.

^([12])

In
June
2006
,
the
Pharmacy
Board
of
the
Washington
State
Department
of
Health
rejected
a
draft
rule
proposed
by
Governor
Christine
Gregoire
to
require
all
pharmacies
to
begin
carrying
Plan
B
.

^([13])
Governor
Gregoire
responded
by
releasing
a
public
statement
warning
the
board
members
to
reconsider
or
they
could
be
removed
.

^([13])
In
July
2006
,
the
Washington
State
Human
Rights
Commission
warned
the
board
members
that
they
would
be
personally
liable
for
illegally
discriminating
against
women
if
they
did
not
pass
the
Governor
'
s
Plan
B
rule
.

^([13][14])
In
April
2007
,
the
Board
approved
a
final
rule
prohibiting
pharmacies
from
not
stocking
Plan
B
for
religious
reasons
but
allowing
exemptions
for
“good
faith”
business
reasons
.

^([13])

When
Ralph
'
s
Thriftway
,
a
grocery
store
in
Olympia
,
Washington
,
refused
for
religious
reasons
to
carry
Plan
B
,
it
was
widely
boycotted
,
leading
Gregoire
to
cancel
the
grocer
'
s
longstanding
account
with
the
Washington
Governor
'
s
Mansion
.

^([13])
The
only
complaints
for
violating
the
Plan
B
rule
were
filed
against
the
grocer
.

^([13])
Half
of
Washington
'
s
hospitals
are
Catholic
.

^([15])
The
grocer
sued
but
,
instead
of
alleging
violations
of
the
broader
Constitution
of
Washington
,
its
attorneys
at
the
Alliance
Defending
Freedom
and
the
Becket
Fund
for
Religious
Liberty
only
filed
under
the
Free
Exercise
Clause
of
the
United
States
Constitution
.

^([16])
The
case

On

,
U
.

S
.


District

granted
the
grocer
a

rule
.

^([17][13])
On

2008
,
United

Court
of
Appeals
for
the
Ninth

Judges
Thomas

Nelson

Jay

denied
the
state
a
stay

the
injunction
pending

over

by

^([18][13])

,
joined
by

and
N
.


Randy
Smith
reversed
the
preliminary
injunction
.

^([19][16])

On
February
22
,
2012
,
after
four
years
of
discovery
and
a
twelve-day
bench
trial
,
Judge
Leighton
issued
a
permanent
injunction
blocking
the
Plan
B
rule
as
unconstitutional
.

^([20])
On

,

,

Judge
Susan
P
.


Graber
,
joined
by
Judges
Mary
H
.


Murguia
and
Richard

reversed
.

^([21][22])
The
grocer
'
s
petition
for
certiorari
from
the
Supreme
Court
of
the
United
States
was
denied
on
June
28
,
2016
.

^([23][24])
Justice
Samuel
Alito
,
joined
by
Chief
Justice
John
Roberts
and
Justice
Clarence
Thomas
,
dissented
,
writing
that
“the
rules
challenged
here
reflect
antipathy
towards
religious
beliefs
that
do
not
accord
with
the
views
of
those
holding
the
levers
of
government
power
.

”^([25][26])

In
2014^([27])
and
2016
,^([28])
Senator
Cory
Booker
introduced
the
“Access
to
Birth
Control
Act”
bill
,
which
would
require
all
pharmacists
in
the
United
States
to
provide
emergency
contraception
.



Responses

[edit]

Health
care
providers
opposed
to
abortion
or
contraception
support
the
clauses
because
they
believe
that
disciplinary
or
legal
action
for
refusing
to
perform
services
obliges
providers
to
supply
services
which
their
moral
or
religious
principles
forbid
.



Reproductive
rights
organizations
,
such
as
Planned
Parenthood
and
NARAL
Pro-Choice
America
,
oppose
the
provision
because
they
maintain
that
pharmacists
,
doctors
,
and
hospitals
have
a
professional
duty
to
fulfill
patients
'

legal
medical
needs
,
regardless
of
their
own
ethical
stances
.


Opponents
see
conscience
clauses
as
an
attempt
to
limit
reproductive
rights
in
lieu
of
bans
struck
down
by
Supreme
Court
rulings
such
as
Roe
v
.


Wade
.

^([29])
Though
the
case
has
been
overturned
by
Dobbs
v
.


Jackson
Women
'
s
Health
Organization
.



As
a
result
,
the
term
"conscience
clause"
is
controversial
and
primarily
used
by
those
who
support
these
provisions
.


Those
who
oppose
them
often
prefer
to
use
the
term
"refusal
clause
,"
implying
that
those
who
exercise
the
clauses
are
refusing
to
treat
a
patient
.



In
2018
,
Roger
Severino
,
the
then-Director
of
the
Office
for
Civil
Rights
at
the
United
States
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
,
criticized
those
who
oppose
conscience
clauses
,
saying
“[t]here’s
a
movement
that
tries
to
squelch
dissent
on
the
question
of
abortion
so
that
those
that
stand
up
for
life
are
being
systematically
driven
out
of
the
medical
profession
.

”
He
also
stated
that
“[n]obody
should
be
fired
from
their
position
as
a
medical
professional
because
they
refuse
to
participate
in
the
taking
of
a
human
life
in
abortion
.


It’s
illegal
,
if
you
receive
federal
funds
.


You
may
expect
an
enforcement
action
from
the
HHS
Office
for
Civil
Rights
,
if
you
do
such
a
thing
.

”^([30])

Catholic
doctrine

[edit]

The
conscience
clause
is
widely
invoked
in
Catholic
universities
,
hospitals
,
and
agencies
because
the
Catholic
Church
opposes
abortion
,
contraceptives
,
sterilization
,
and
embryonic
stem
cell
treatments
.


Opponents
of
related
FOCA
legislation
have
interpreted
the
possible
end
of
the
conscience
clause
as
a
demand
to
either
"do
abortions
or
close
.

"^([31])
Timothy
Dolan
has
said
,
"“In
effect
,
the
president
is
saying
we
have
a
year
to
figure
out
how
to
violate
our
consciences
.

"^([32])
However
,
conscience
clauses
are
sometimes
interpreted
differently
and
their
use
will
often
depend
on
the
given
context
.

^([33])

Three
members
of
the
Department
of
Obstetrics
,
Gynecology
and
Reproductive
Sciences
and
the
Bixby
Center
for
Global
Reproductive
Health
at
UCSF
have
questioned
whether
"conscience
clauses"
are
ethical
,
writing
in
a
journal
article
that
"in
some
Catholic-owned
hospitals
,
the
private
patient–physician
relationship
,
patient
safety
,
and
patient
comfort
are
compromised
by
religious
mandates
that
require
physicians
to
act
contrary
to
the
current
standard
of
care
in
miscarriage
management
.

1
.


Everyone
has
the
right
to
freedom
of
thought
,
conscience
and
religion
.


This
right
includes
freedom
to
change
religion
or
belief
and
freedom
,
either
alone
or
in
community
with
others
and
in
public
or
in
private
,
to
manifest
religion
or
belief
,
in
worship
,
teaching
,
practice
and
observance
.


2
.


The
right
to
conscientious
objection
is
recognised
,
in
accordance
with
the
national
laws
governing
the
exercise
of
this
right
.



Explanations

-
Text
:

The
right
guaranteed
in
paragraph
1
corresponds
to
the
right

guaranteed
in
Article
9
of
the
ECHR
and
,
in
accordance
with
Article

52(3)
of
the
Charter
,
has
the
same
meaning
and
scope
.


Limitations

must
therefore
respect
Article
9(2)
of
the
Convention
,
which
reads

as
follows
:
"Freedom
to
manifest
one
'
s
religion
or
beliefs
shall
be

subject
only
to
such
limitations
as
are
prescribed
by
law
and
are

necessary
in
a
democratic
society
in
the
interests
of
public
safety
,

for
the
protection
of
public
order
,
health
or
morals
,
or
for
the

protection
of
the
rights
and
freedoms
of
others
.

"


The
right
guaranteed
in
paragraph
2
corresponds
to
national

constitutional
traditions
and
to
the
development
of
national

legislation
on
this
issue
.

Preamble
-
Explanations
relating
to
the
Charter
of
Fundamental

Rights
:

These
explanations
were
originally
prepared
under
the
authority
of

the
Praesidium
of
the
Convention
which
drafted
the
Charter
of

Fundamental
Rights
of
the
European
Union
.


Although
they
do
not
as

such
have
the
status
of
law
,
they
are
a
valuable
tool
of

interpretation
intended
to
clarify
the
provisions
of
the
Charter
.

(18)
Derogation
from
stunning
in
case
of
religious
slaughter
taking

place
in
slaughterhouses
was
granted
by
Directive
93/119/EC
.


Since

Community
provisions
applicable
to
religious
slaughter
have
been

transposed
differently
depending
on
national
contexts
and

considering
that
national
rules
take
into
account
dimensions
that
go

beyond
the
purpose
of
this
Regulation
,
it
is
important
that

derogation
from
stunning
animals
prior
to
slaughter
should
be

maintained
,
leaving
,
however
,
a
certain
level
of
subsidiarity
to

each
Member
State
.


As
a
consequence
,
this
Regulation
respects
the

freedom
of
religion

right
to
manifest
religion
or
belief
in

worship
,
teaching
,
practice
and
observance
,

Jewish
People’s
Experiences
and
Perceptions
of
Antisemitism


Antisemitism
is
still
a
reality
for
many
Jewish
people
in
the
EU

today
.


Faced
with
prejudice
and
hostility
,
most
feel
unable
to
live

openly
Jewish
lives
.


This
report
presents
the
results
of
FRA’s
third

EU
survey
of
Jewish
people’s
experiences
and
perceptions
of

antisemitism
.


The
survey
took
place
before
the
Hamas
attacks
in

October
2023
and
the
war
in
Gaza
;
however
,
it
includes
evidence
from

a
consultation
with
national
and
European
Jewish
umbrella

organisations
since
.


It
covers
13
EU
Member
States
that
together

account
for
around
96
%
of
the
EU’s
Jewish
population
.

Artificial

Artificial

is
everywhere
and
affects
everyone
–
from

deciding
what
content
people
see

to

determining
who

AI

even
fully

How
SB
1580
Defines
‘Right
of
Medical
Conscience’
and
Free
Speech
in
Health
Care
By
Jeff
Scott
,
Esq
.


,
FMA
General
Counsel

July

2023

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Should
a
physician
be
subject
to
discipline
or
job
termination
for
refusing
to
provide
a
health
care
service
that
the
physician
has
a
sincerely
held
religious
,
moral
,
or
ethical
objection
to
?


During
the
2023
session
,
the
Florida
Legislature
answered
this
question
by
passing
SB
1580
.


In
the
first
section
of
this
bill
,
the
Legislature
made
its
position
clear
on
this
issue
by
stating
that

It
is
the
intent
of
the
Legislature
to
provide
the
right
of
medical
conscience
for
health
care
providers
and
payors
to
ensure
they
can
care
for
patients
in
a
manner
consistent
with
their
moral
,
ethical
,
and
religious
convictions
.


Further
,
it
is
the
intent
of
the
Legislature
that
licensed
health
care
providers
and
payors
be
free
from
threat
of
discrimination
for
providing
conscience-based
health
care
.



This
Legislature
coupled
this
“right
of
medical
conscience”
with
a
provision
protecting
the
“use
of
free
speech
by
a
health
care
practitioner”
to
create
a
comprehensive
legislative
package
that
was
a
priority
of
Gov
.


Ron
DeSantis
.


This
analysis
of
SB
1580
will
attempt
to
explain
how
these
two
new
provisions
affect
the
practice
of
medicine
.


Right
of
Medical
Conscience
SB
1580
creates
a
new
section
of
the
Florida
Statutes¹
that
gives
health
care
providers
(and
health
care
payors)
the
right
to
“opt
out
of
participation
in
or
payment
for
any
health
care
service
on
the
basis
of
a
conscience-based
objection
.

”
It
is
important
to
note
that
this
right
of
conscience
only
applies
to
a
“health
care
service
.

”
It
does
not
give
a
health
care
provider
the
right
to
refuse
to
perform
job
requirements
that
do
not
involve
the
provision
of
a
health
care
service
,
or
the
right
to
refuse
to
provide
a
health
care
service
to
a
particular
class
of
individuals
.


“Health
care
service”
is
defined
to
mean
:

medical
research
,
medical
procedures
,
or
medical
services
,
including
,
but
not
limited
to
,
testing
;
diagnosis
;
referral
;
dispensing
or
administering
any
drug
,
medication
,
or
device
;
psychological
therapy
or
counseling
;
research
;
therapy
;
record-making
procedures
;
set
up
or
performance
of
a
surgery
or
procedure
;
or
any
other
care
or
services
performed
or
provided
by
any
health
care
provider
.



If
a
health
care
provider
has
a
conscience-based
objection
to
performing
abortions
,
the
provider
may
not
be
discriminated
against
or
suffer
adverse
action
for
refusing
to
perform
abortions
.


However
,
a
provider
may
not
choose
to
perform
abortions
for
some
patients
,
but
not
for
other
patients
based
on
the
patient’s
race
,
color
,
religion
,
sex
,
or
national
origin
.


The
right
of
conscience
is
solely
attached
to
a
specific
health
care
service
.


A
provider
can
refuse
to
prescribe
contraceptives
to
his/her
patients
but
cannot
refuse
to
prescribe
contraceptives
to
only
Medicaid
recipients
.


A
provider
who
elects
to
provide
a
particular
medical
procedure
to
his/her
patients
may
not
refuse
to
provide
that
procedure
to
a
subset
of
patients
who
engage
in
a
certain
type
of
behavior
,
even
if
the
provider
has
a
conscience-based
objection
to
that
behavior
.


While
the
bill
sponsors
made
it
clear
as
to
what
the
right
of
conscience
applies
to
,
they
left
the
issue
of
whether
a
conscientious
objection
exists
less
certain
.


SB
1580
defines
a
“conscience-based
objection”
as
an
objection
based
on
a
sincerely
held
religious
,
moral
,
or
ethical
belief
.

²
As
noted
in
the
footnote
,
whether
an
entity
such
as
an
insurance
company
has
a
conscience
is
determined
by
existing
written
evidence
.


If
the
articles
of
incorporation
for
an
insurer
state
that
the
company
exists
to
provide
health
insurance
for
individuals
whose
religion
forbids
the
use
of
birth
control
,
then
that
insurer
will
be
safe
from
adverse
action
for
selling
insurance
policies
that
do
not
provide
coverage
for
birth
control
(unless
of
course
there
is
a
contrary
federal
requirement)
.


If
the
company
cannot
produce
a
governing
document
,
published
guideline
,
or
set
of
policies
or
regulations
,
it
will
not
be
entitled
to
assert
a
right
of
conscience
.


Individual
health
care
providers³
,
on
the
other
hand
,
do
not
have
to
produce
written
evidence
attesting
to
a
sincerely
held
religious
,
moral
,
or
ethical
belief
.


Apparently
,
it
will
be
up
to
the
Florida
Attorney
General
,
as
the
entity
given
enforcement
authority
for
this
statute
,
to
determine
whether
a
health
care
provider
alleging
a
violation
has
a
valid
conscience-based
objection
.


Presumably
,
the
Attorney
General
will
assess
a
provider’s
self-professed
belief
on
a
case-by-case
basis
in
a
manner
congruent
with
the
inquiry
used
for
similar
laws
,
such
as
Title
VII
of
the
Civil
Rights
Act
of
1964
(requiring
employers
to
provide
an
accommodation
for
employee’s
sincerely
held
religious
beliefs)
.


Health
care
providers
and
payors
who
wish
to
opt
out
of
participation
in
or
payment
for
a
health
care
service
due
to
a
conscience-based
objection
must
do
the
following
:

-
At
the
time
of
the
objection
or
as
soon
as
practicable
,
provide

written
notice
of
the
objection
to
the
provider’s
supervisor
or

employer
,
as
applicable
.


-
Document
the
objection
to
the
particular
health
care
service
in
the

patient’s
medical
file
.


-
Notify
patients
seeking
an
appointment
for
a
health
care
service

that
the
provider
has
a
conscience-based
objection
to
of
that

objection
before
scheduling
the
appointment
.


-
Providers
who
are
students
must
provide
written
notice
of
their

conscience-based
objection
to
the
educational
institution
at
the

time
the
objection
is
made
or
as
soon
as
practicable
.



Providers
who
comply
with
these
requirements
may
not
be
discriminated
against⁴
or
suffer
adverse
action⁵
for
exercising
their
right
of
medical
conscience
.


The
right
of
medical
conscience
section
also
includes
speech
and
whistle-blower
protections
,
which
prohibit
discriminating
or
taking
adverse
action
against
health
care
providers
or
payors
who
report
violations
of
the
new
right
of
medical
conscience
statute
.


This
protection
is
extended
to
providers
who
testify
,
assist
or
participate
in
a
proceeding
brought
by
the
Attorney
General
to
determine
if
a
violation
occurred
.


Interestingly
,
this
part
of
the
new
law
also
includes
a
prohibition
on
discriminating
against
a
health
care
provider
or
payor
for
reasons
not
related
to
the
right
of
medical
conscience
.


Protection
from
discrimination
is
extended
to
the
disclosure
of
information
the
provider
or
payor
reasonably
believes
constitutes
:

-
A
violation
of
any
law
,
rule
,
or
regulation
.


-
A
violation
of
any
ethical
guidelines
for
the
provision
of
any

medical
procedure
or
service
;
or
-
A
practice
or
method
of
treatment
that
may
put
patient
health
at

risk
or
present
substantial
and
specific
danger
to
public
health
and

safety
.



This
protection
appears
to
be
very
broad
and
could
potentially
provide
protection
in
situations
as
varied
as
physicians
who
complain
about
health
insurance
prior
authorization
procedures
or
physicians
who
notify
a
hospital
of
violations
of
medical
staff
bylaws
.


Under
the
original
House
companion
to
SB
1580
,
health
care
providers
and
payors
were
given
a
civil
cause
of
action
for
any
violation
of
the
right
of
conscience
section
.


SB
1580
,
however
,
rejected
this
approach
in
favor
of
allowing
the
Attorney
General
to
investigate
complaints
and
bring
a
civil
action
for
damages
,
injunctive
or
other
appropriate
relief
,
and
attorney
fees
.


Health
care
providers
and
payors
who
decline
to
participate
in
or
pay
for
a
health
care
service
because
of
a
conscience-based
objection
may
not
be
held
civilly
liable
on
that
basis
alone
.


Finally
,
acknowledging
the
existence
of
federal
EMTALA
requirements
,
the
Legislature
specifically
stated
that
the
medical
conscience
section
does
not
override
any
state
or
federal
requirement
to
provide
emergency
medical
treatment
.


Use
of
Free
Speech
by
a
Health
Care
Practitioner
A
bill
to
ensure
the
use
of
free
speech
by
a
health
care
practitioner
was
filed
as
a
stand-alone
bill
during
the
2022
session
(HB
687/SB
1184)
.


Despite
support
from
the
Governor
,
the
bills
never
made
it
to
the
House
or
Senate
floor
.


The
free
speech
concept
,
in
a
different
form
,
was
combined
with
the
right
of
conscience
issue
in
SB
1580
,
passed
out
of
both
chambers
,
and
was
approved
by
the
Governor
less
than
a
week
after
the
end
of
session
.


This
scaled
down
version
prohibits
a
licensing
board
(or
the
Department
of
Health
if
there
is
no
board)
from
taking
disciplinary
action
against
a
health
care
practitioner⁶
solely
because
the
practitioner
has
spoken
or
written
publicly
about
a
health
care
service
or
public
policy
.


This
includes
postings
on
social
media
.


This
protection
DOES
NOT
APPLY
to
speech
,
written
communications
,
or
social
media
postings
that
the
provider
uses
to
provide
medical
advice
or
treatment
to
a
specific
patient
.


The
protection
from
board
discipline
also
does
not
apply
to
speech
or
written
communication
that
separately
violates
a
different
law
or
rule
.


Thus
,
a
health
care
practitioner
can
basically
say
anything
they
like
about
health
care
or
public
policy
,
regardless
of
whether
the
assertion
reflects
the
actual
standard
of
care
or
is
based
on
sound
scientific
principles
,
as
long
as
it
is
not
made
to
a
specific
patient
as
part
of
the
medical
care
of
that
patient
.


Unlike
the
2022
version
,
there
are
no
provisions
that
would
impose
sanctions
on
a
board
that
violated
this
provision
.


Part
of
the
impetus
for
this
new
right
of
practitioner
free
speech
is
the
alleged
actions
of
the
American
Board
of
Medical
Specialties
(ABMS)
in
dealing
with
physicians
who
advocated
for
alternative
treatments
for
COVID-19
or
questioned
the
safety
of
COVID
vaccines
.


To
correct
this
perceived
overreach
,
the
free
speech
section
of
SB
1580
includes
a
provision
that
discourages
an
approved
board-certification
recognizing
agency
from
revoking
the
certification
of
a
health
care
practitioner
for
speaking
or
writing
about
a
health
care
service
or
public
policy
.


As
with
the
licensing
boards
,
this
protection
applies
to
postings
on
social
media
but
does
not
apply
to
speech
that
constitutes
medical
advice
or
treatment
to
a
specific
patient
.


A
specialty
board
that
revokes
the
certification
of
a
provider
solely
because
the
provider
exercised
their
free
speech
rights
under
this
section
may
have
their
approval
revoked
by
the
issuing
board
.


It
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
specialty
boards
of
the
ABMS
are
recognized
by
statute
and
not
the
Board
of
Medicine⁷
.


As
the
BOM
only
has
the
authority
to
revoke
the
approval
from
a
recognizing
agency
that
it
has
approved
,
it
appears
that
the
BOM
does
not
have
the
authority
to
hold
an
ABMS
specialty
board
accountable
for
actions
taken
in
violation
of
this
section
.

Challenges
to
Fostering
Class
Consciousness[Original
Blog]

Fostering
class
consciousness
,
a
cornerstone
of
Marxian
economics
,
is
a
complex
and
multifaceted
task
.


The
notion
of
class
consciousness
revolves
around
the
idea
of
workers
recognizing
their
shared
class
interests
and
the
potential
for
collective
action
to
challenge
and
transform
the
existing
socio-economic
system
.


However
,
this
process
is
not
without
its
challenges
.


In
this
section
,
we
delve
into
the
hurdles
and
obstacles
that
often
hinder
the
development
of
class
consciousness
,
exploring
different
perspectives
and
offering
insights
into
the
intricacies
of
this
vital
concept
.



1
.


Economic
Precarity
and
Alienation
:
One
of
the
fundamental
challenges
to
fostering
class
consciousness
lies
in
the
economic
precarity
experienced
by
many
workers
.


In
a
society
where
job
insecurity
,
low
wages
,
and
underemployment
are
prevalent
,
individuals
may
be
too
preoccupied
with
immediate
financial
concerns
to
engage
in
class-conscious
activities
.


Alienation
from
their
labor
and
a
constant
struggle
to
make
ends
meet
can
deter
workers
from
identifying
with
a
broader
class-based
perspective
.



2
.


Individualism
and
Consumerism
:
The
prevailing
culture
of
individualism
and
consumerism
in
many
societies
can
undermine
efforts
to
build
class
consciousness
.


People
are
encouraged
to
view
success
in
terms
of
personal
achievements
and
material
possessions
rather
than
collective
well-being
.


The
pursuit
of
personal
aspirations
often
overshadows
the
recognition
of
shared
class
interests
.



3
.


Division
and
Fragmentation
:
The
working
class
is
far
from
a
monolithic
entity
.


It
encompasses
a
wide
range
of
occupations
,
backgrounds
,
and
identities
.


This
diversity
can
sometimes
lead
to
divisions
within
the
working
class
,
making
it
challenging
to
foster
a
unified
sense
of
class
consciousness
.


Issues
such
as
race
,
gender
,
and
ethnicity
can
intersect
with
class
,
creating
complex
dynamics
.



4
.


Media
and
Ideological
Hegemony
:
Mass
media
and
cultural
institutions
often
perpetuate
the
status
quo
,
reinforcing
dominant
ideologies
that
serve
the
interests
of
the
ruling
class
.


Media
outlets
,
through
their
content
and
representation
,
can
distort
or
obscure
class-related
issues
.


This
ideological
hegemony
can
mislead
individuals
into
believing
that
their
interests
align
more
with
the
elite
than
with
their
fellow
workers
.



5
.


Repression
and
Fear
:
In
some
contexts
,
fostering
class
consciousness
can
be
met
with
repression
,
intimidation
,
or
even
violence
.


Governments
,
corporations
,
or
other
powerful
entities
may
employ
tactics
to
suppress
labor
movements
and
collective
organizing
.


Fear
of
retaliation
can
discourage
individuals
from
openly
embracing
class-conscious
ideas
.



6
.


Historical
and
Cultural
Factors
:
The
historical
and
cultural
context
of
a
region
plays
a
significant
role
in
shaping
class
consciousness
.


In
some
places
,
a
strong
tradition
of
workers
'

movements
and
unions
has
fostered
class
solidarity
,
while
in
others
,
such
movements
have
been
historically
weaker
or
less
influential
.



7
.


Lack
of
Education
and
Awareness
:
Many
people
lack
a
basic
understanding
of
Marxist
principles
and
class
dynamics
.


The
absence
of
accessible
education
and
awareness
programs
can
hinder
the
development
of
class
consciousness
.


Effective
education
that
elucidates
the
structures
of
capitalism
and
class
struggle
is
crucial
for
empowering
the
proletariat
.



8
.


Globalization
and
Mobility
:
In
today
'
s
globalized
world
,
the
mobility
of
labor
and
the
integration
of
economies
across
borders
can
complicate
efforts
to
foster
class
consciousness
.


Workers
may
identify
more
with
their
profession
or
trade
than
with
a
broader
class
identity
,
as
they
often
compete
with
peers
from
various
countries
.



9
.


Generational
Shifts
:
The
perception
of
class
consciousness
can
also
vary
across
generations
.


Older
workers
may
have
experienced
different
economic
and
labor
conditions
than
younger
generations
,
leading
to
varying
degrees
of
commitment
to
class-based
movements
.



These
challenges
underscore
the
intricate
nature
of
fostering
class
consciousness
in
contemporary
society
.


To
empower
the
proletariat
and
advocate
for
their
collective
interests
,
it
is
essential
to
address
these
hurdles
with
nuance
and
creativity
,
recognizing
that
the
path
to
class
consciousness
is
not
uniform
and
requires
tailored
strategies
that
account
for
the
unique
circumstances
and
contexts
in
which
individuals
find
themselves
.

Contemporary
Relevance
of
Class
Consciousness[Original
Blog]

Contemporary
relevance

Class
consciousness
,
a
concept
deeply
rooted
in
Marxist
theory
,
has
long
been
a
subject
of
scholarly
debate
and
practical
application
.


Its
contemporary
relevance
cannot
be
overstated
,
as
it
continues
to
shape
discussions
around
labor
rights
,
social
justice
,
and
economic
inequality
.


At
its
core
,
class
consciousness
represents
the
awareness
and
unity
of
the
working
class
,
or
the
proletariat
,
in
recognizing
their
shared
interests
and
struggles
against
the
capitalist
system
.


While
some
may
argue
that
class
consciousness
has
diminished
in
the
face
of
globalization
and
changing
labor
markets
,
others
maintain
that
it
remains
a
potent
force
in
modern
society
.

.


Globalization
and
Fragmentation
:
In
an
era
marked
by
the
globalization
of
markets
and
the
rise
of
the
gig
economy
,
some
critics
argue
that
traditional
class
consciousness
is
eroding
.


With
workers
increasingly
scattered
across
different
industries
and
geographies
,
they
may
not
identify
as
readily
with
a
unified
working
class
.


However
,
proponents
of
class
consciousness
counter
this
by
pointing
out
that
globalization
has
also
brought
workers
together
through
digital
platforms
and
global
supply
chains
.


This
interconnectedness
can
facilitate
the
spread
of
ideas
and
solidarity
among
workers
.

Digital
Activism
and
Class
Awareness
:
The
digital
age
has
transformed
the
way
people
organize
and
communicate
,
and
this
includes
the
realm
of
class
consciousness
.


Online
forums
,

social
media
,
and
digital
activism
have
played
a
significant
role
in
raising
awareness
about
labor
issues
and
mobilizing
workers
.


Movements
like
the
Fight
for
$15
in
the
United
States
or
the
"gilets
jaunes"
protests
in
France
demonstrate
how
digital
platforms
can
amplify
class
consciousness
and
lead
to
collective
action
.

Income
Inequality
:
The
growing
chasm
between
the
ultra-rich
and
the
working
class
has
brought
class
consciousness
back
into
the
spotlight
.


High-profile
cases
of
income
inequality
,
such
as
the
1%
versus
the
99%
,
have
drawn
attention
to
the
disparities
in
wealth
and
power
.


This
disparity
fuels
class
consciousness
by
highlighting
the
shared
economic
challenges
faced
by
the
majority
of
the
population
.

.


labor
Unions
and
Collective
bargaining
:
Labor
unions
,
historically
instrumental
in
advancing
the
cause
of
the
working
class
,
continue
to
play
a
vital
role
in
promoting
class
consciousness
.


Collective
bargaining
and
strikes
remain
powerful
tools
for
workers
to
assert
their
rights
and
negotiate
better
working
conditions
.


The
2018
teacher
strikes
in
several
U
.

S
.


States
and
the
ongoing
labor
movements
in
various
countries
underscore
the
enduring
importance
of
organized
labor
in
fostering
class
solidarity
.

Cultural
and
Political
Movements
:
Cultural
and
political
movements
have
also
contributed
to
the
revitalization
of
class
consciousness
.


For
example
,
the
resurgence
of
socialist
and
leftist
political
movements
in
different
parts
of
the
world
reflects
a
renewed
interest
in
addressing
class-based
issues
.


These
movements
often
frame
their
agendas
around
economic
justice
and
the
redistribution
of
wealth
,
resonating
with
the
core
tenets
of
class
consciousness
.

Case
Study
:
Amazon
Workers
:
The
struggles
of
Amazon
workers
provide
a
tangible
example
of
contemporary
class
consciousness
.


Employees
in
Amazon
fulfillment
centers
and
delivery
drivers
have
organized
protests
and
strikes
to
demand
better
working
conditions
and
fair
wages
.


These
actions
have
garnered
widespread
attention
and
illustrate
how
workers
can
unite
across
geographic
boundaries
in
pursuit
of
common
goals
.



In
a
world
characterized
by
economic
volatility
and
evolving
labor
dynamics
,
class
consciousness
remains
a
relevant
and
dynamic
concept
.


While
its
forms
and
expressions
may
adapt
to
changing
circumstances
,
the
fundamental
idea
of
workers
recognizing
their
shared
interests
and
collective
power
continues
to
shape
the
discourse
on
social
and
economic
justice
.


Understanding
the
contemporary
relevance
of
class
consciousness
is
essential
for
addressing
the
challenges
of
inequality
and
advocating
for
the
empowerment
of
the

The
Role
of
Class
Consciousness
in
Marxian
Theory[Original
Blog]

Class
consciousness
is
a
fundamental
concept
in
Marxian
theory
,
serving
as
a
cornerstone
in
the
broader
framework
of
Marxist
economics
and
social
philosophy
.


At
its
core
,
class
consciousness
refers
to
the
awareness
that
individuals
within
a
particular
socioeconomic
class
share
common
interests
,
experiences
,
and
a
collective
identity
.


It
is
a
critical
component
in
Marx
'
s
vision
of
a
class
struggle
that
would
eventually
lead
to
a
classless
society
,
and
its
significance
reverberates
throughout
the
entire
spectrum
of
Marxist
thought
.


To
truly
comprehend
the
depth
and
impact
of
class
consciousness
,
one
must
consider
it
from
various
angles
,
examining
its
implications
,
development
,
and
role
in
shaping
the
fate
of
the
proletariat
.



1
.


Foundation
of
Class
Struggle
:
Class
consciousness
,
in
the
context
of
Marxian
theory
,
forms
the
foundation
for
the
class
struggle
.


The
working
class
,
or
proletariat
,
must
first
recognize
their
shared
exploitation
and
oppression
by
the
capitalist
class
.


This
awareness
motivates
them
to
unite
in
pursuit
of
their
collective
interests
,
ultimately
leading
to
the
overthrow
of
the
capitalist
system
.



2
.


Historical
Materialism
:
Class
consciousness
is
intimately
tied
to
Marx
'
s
theory
of
historical
materialism
.


As
societies
evolve
,
so
do
class
structures
.


The
awareness
of
one
'
s
class
position
is
pivotal
in
understanding
how
historical
developments
and
economic
changes
impact
different
groups
within
society
.



3
.


Development
of
Class
Consciousness
:
Class
consciousness
is
not
innate
;
it
develops
over
time
.


Workers
often
go
through
stages
of
awakening
,
from
individual
grievances
to
recognizing
their
common
interests
.


This
progression
can
be
seen
in
labor
movements
and
revolutionary
uprisings
throughout
history
.


For
instance
,
the
transition
from
isolated
workers
'

strikes
to
the
formation
of
labor
unions
reflects
the
evolution
of
class
consciousness
.



4
.


Class
Alienation
:
The
concept
of
alienation
is
closely
linked
to
class
consciousness
.


When
workers
become
aware
of
their
alienation
from
the
fruits
of
their
labor
and
the
capitalist
system
that
perpetuates
it
,
they
are
more
likely
to
unite
in
solidarity
.


This
realization
fuels
their
desire
for
social
change
.



5
.


Global
Class
Consciousness
:
In
a
globalized
world
,
class
consciousness
extends
beyond
national
borders
.


Workers
worldwide
share
similar
struggles
in
the
face
of
multinational
corporations
.


This
global
perspective
highlights
the
importance
of
international
workers
'

solidarity
,
as
exemplified
by
the
solidarity
of
workers
in
different
countries
during
events
like
the
May
Day
protests
.



6
.


Class
Consciousness
in
Contemporary
Society
:
While
Marx
'
s
ideas
on
class
consciousness
were
developed
in
the
19th
century
,
they
remain
relevant
today
.


The
digital
age
and
the
gig
economy
have
transformed
the
nature
of
work
,
but
the
core
issues
of
exploitation
and
inequality
persist
,
making
class
consciousness
as
crucial
as
ever
.



7
.


Obstacles
to
Class
Consciousness
:
Various
factors
can
hinder
the
development
of
class
consciousness
,
including
ideological
influences
,
consumerism
,
and
false
consciousness
.


These
obstacles
can
divert
the
attention
of
the
working
class
from
their
shared
interests
,
making
it
more
challenging
to
mobilize
for
change
.



8
.


Intersectionality
:
Contemporary
discussions
on
class
consciousness
also
consider
intersectionality
,
recognizing
that
individuals
may
belong
to
multiple
oppressed
or
marginalized
groups
simultaneously
.


This
intersectionality
can
influence
how
individuals
perceive
their
class
interests
and
interact
with
others
within
their
class
.



9
.


Examples
of
Class
Consciousness
in
Action
:
Historical
events
,
such
as
the
Russian
Revolution
of
1917
,
the
labor
movements
of
the
19th
and
20th
centuries
,
and
more
recent
instances
like
the
Occupy
Wall
Street
protests
,
exemplify
how
class
consciousness
can
lead
to
significant
social
and
political
change
.



10
.


Class
Consciousness
as
a
Catalyst
for
Social
Transformation
:
Ultimately
,
class
consciousness
plays
a
pivotal
role
in
Marxian
theory
by
propelling
the
working
class
towards
the
revolution
and
the
establishment
of
a
classless
society
.


It
serves
as
the
driving
force
behind
the
Marxist
vision
of
a
world
where
social
and
economic
inequality
are
eradicated
.



Class
consciousness
,
therefore
,
is
not
just
a
theoretical
concept
;
it
is
a
dynamic
force
that
has
shaped
and
continues
to
shape
the
course
of
history
.


It
provides
a
lens
through
which
we
can
understand
the
struggles
and
aspirations
of
the
working
class
and
the
broader
sociopolitical
landscape
.

Historical
Movements
and
Class
Consciousness

In
the
vast
and
intricate
realm
of
Marxian
economics
,
class
consciousness
plays
a
pivotal
role
in
shaping
the
dynamics
of
societies
and
historical
movements
.


It
serves
as
the
driving
force
behind
the
empowerment
of
the
proletariat
,
a
central
concept
in
Marxist
theory
.


To
truly
understand
the
significance
of
class
consciousness
,
we
must
delve
into
historical
case
studies
that
vividly
illustrate
its
role
in
shaping
societal
shifts
and
upheavals
.


From
the
industrial
revolution
to
modern-day
labor
movements
,
the
interplay
between
class
consciousness
and
historical
movements
has
been
instrumental
in
the
struggle
for
workers
'

rights
and
social
justice
.

.


The
Industrial
Revolution
and
the
Emergence
of
Class
Consciousness

The
Industrial
Revolution
of
the
18th
and
19th
centuries
marked
a
turning
point
in
history
.


With
the
rise
of
factories
and
mass
production
,
a
stark
divide
between
the
bourgeoisie
(owners
and
capitalists)
and
the
proletariat
(working
class)
became
evident
.


This
stark
economic
divide
led
to
a
heightened
awareness
among
the
working
class
about
their
shared
grievances
and
interests
.


The
publication
of
"The
Communist
Manifesto"
by
Karl
Marx
and
Friedrich
Engels
in
1848
provided
a
theoretical
framework
that
fueled
class
consciousness
,
uniting
workers
in
their
quest
for
better
working
conditions
,
fair
wages
,
and
a
more
equitable
society
.

.


The
Russian
Revolution
:
Class
Consciousness
in
Action

The
Russian
Revolution
of
1917
is
a
prime
example
of
how
class
consciousness
can
drive
historical
movements
.


The
Bolsheviks
,
led
by
Vladimir
Lenin
,
harnessed
the
collective
class
consciousness
of
the
Russian
proletariat
to
overthrow
the
ruling
class
and
establish
a
communist
state
.


The
revolution
demonstrated
how
a
well-organized
working
class
,
fueled
by
their
shared
class
interests
,
can
bring
about
a
radical
transformation
of
society
.


The
events
of
1917
not
only
reshaped
Russia
but
also
had
a
profound
impact
on
the
global
political
landscape
.

.


Labor
Movements
in
the
20th
Century

Throughout
the
20th
century
,
labor
movements
around
the
world
harnessed
class
consciousness
to
advocate
for
workers
'

rights
.


Organizations
like
the
American
Federation
of
Labor
(AFL)
and
the
Congress
of
Industrial
Organizations
(CIO)
in
the
United
States
united
workers
from
various
industries
,
fostering
a
collective
identity
and
a
sense
of
solidarity
.


These
movements
led
to
significant
changes
in
labor
laws
,
improved
working
conditions
,
and
higher
wages
for
millions
of
workers
.

.


Globalization
and
Contemporary
Class
Consciousness

In
the
era
of
globalization
,
class
consciousness
has
taken
on
a
new
dimension
.


Workers
from
different
parts
of
the
world
now
find
common
cause
in
addressing
issues
related
to
income
inequality
,
exploitation
,
and
the
erosion
of
labor
rights
.


Social
movements
like
Occupy
Wall
Street
and
the
Fight
for
$15
campaign
in
the
United
States
have
tapped
into
a
globalized
class
consciousness
,
advocating
for
economic
justice
on
a
larger
scale
.

.


Challenges
and
Critiques
of
Class
Consciousness

It
'
s
important
to
acknowledge
that
class
consciousness
is
not
without
its
challenges
and
critiques
.


Some
argue
that
it
may
oversimplify
complex
societal
dynamics
and
that
it
doesn
'
t
account
for
the
intersectionality
of
identities
,
such
as
race
and
gender
.


Nevertheless
,
as
a
foundational
concept
in
Marxist
thought
,
class
consciousness
remains
a
powerful
force
in
mobilizing
workers
and
driving
historical
movements
.



The
relationship
between
historical
movements
and
class
consciousness
is
a
dynamic
and
ongoing
one
.


These
case
studies
demonstrate
how
an
awareness
of
class
interests
and
shared
grievances
can
unite
the
working
class
and
drive
transformative
social
change
.


While
class
consciousness
may
have
evolved
in
response
to
changing
economic
and
social
conditions
,
its
significance
in
the
struggle
for
workers
'

rights
and
societal
justice
endures
,
making
it
a
central
concept
in
the
realm
of
Marxian
economics
.

Marxian
Economics
and
Class
Consciousness

The
realm
of
economics
is
multifaceted
,
and
it
has
been
shaped
by
a
myriad
of
influential
thinkers
over
the
centuries
.


One
name
that
stands
out
prominently
is
Karl
Marx
,
whose
revolutionary
ideas
have
profoundly
impacted
our
understanding
of
economics
and
society
.


Central
to
Marx
'
s
economic
theories
is
the
concept
of
class
consciousness
.


In
this
section
,
we
delve
into
the
core
principles
of
Marxian
Economics
and
explore
the
vital
role
that
class
consciousness
plays
in
empowering
the
proletariat
.



Marxian
Economics
,
often
referred
to
as
Marxism
,
is
a
socio-economic
theory
that
was
first
formulated
by
Karl
Marx
and
Friedrich
Engels
in
the
mid-19th
century
.


It
offers
a
unique
perspective
on
how
societies
function
,
particularly
in
relation
to
the
distribution
of
wealth
and
power
.


At
the
heart
of
Marxian
Economics
is
the
idea
that
society
is
divided
into
distinct
social
classes
,
primarily
the
bourgeoisie
(the
capitalist
class)
and
the
proletariat
(the
working
class)
.


These
classes
have
opposing
interests
,
with
the
bourgeoisie
seeking
to
maintain
their
wealth
and
power
,
while
the
proletariat
aims
to
overcome
the
exploitation
they
face
.



1
.


The
Class
Struggle
:
Marxian
Economics
posits
that
the
history
of
all
hitherto
existing
societies
is
the
history
of
class
struggles
.


The
bourgeoisie
and
the
proletariat
are
in
a
perpetual
conflict
over
resources
and
control
.


This
struggle
is
at
the
core
of
Marx
'
s
analysis
of
capitalism
,
as
he
believed
that
it
would
eventually
lead
to
a
proletarian
revolution
.



2
.


Exploitation
of
Labor
:
Marx
argued
that
capitalism
inherently
exploits
the
labor
of
the
working
class
.


Workers
produce
goods
and
services
,
but
the
surplus
value
created
by
their
labor
is
appropriated
by
the
capitalists
.


This
exploitation
is
a
driving
force
behind
the
development
of
class
consciousness
.



3
.


Class
Consciousness
Defined
:
Class
consciousness
is
the
awareness
among
members
of
the
working
class
that
they
share
common
interests
,
are
oppressed
by
the
capitalist
class
,
and
should
unite
to
challenge
this
oppression
.


It
is
a
collective
realization
that
their
struggles
are
not
isolated
but
part
of
a
broader
societal
issue
.



4
.


Examples
of
Class
Consciousness
:
The
labor
movements
of
the
late
19th
and
early
20th
centuries
provide
concrete
examples
of
class
consciousness
in
action
.


Workers
organized
into
unions
and
political
parties
to
advocate
for
better
working
conditions
,
higher
wages
,
and
fair
treatment
.


These
movements
aimed
to
address
the
power
imbalance
inherent
in
capitalism
.



5
.


Empowering
the
Proletariat
:
Class
consciousness
is
a
crucial
step
in
empowering
the
proletariat
.


By
recognizing
their
shared
plight
and
working
together
,
workers
gain
the
ability
to
challenge
the
capitalist
system
and
strive
for
a
more
equitable
society
.


This
empowerment
can
lead
to
political
change
,
economic
reforms
,
and
social
progress
.

.


Critiques
and
Controversies
:
It
'
s
important
to
note
that
Marxian
Economics
and
the
concept
of
class
consciousness
are
not
without
their
critics
.


Some
argue
that
class
struggle
has
evolved
,
while
others
question
the
feasibility
of
a
proletarian
revolution
in
today
'
s
complex
global
economy
.


Nevertheless
,
the
ideas
continue
to
be
influential
in
discussions
about
income
inequality
,
labor
rights
,
and
the
role
of
capitalism
in
society
.



In
summary
,
Marxian
Economics
,
with
its
focus
on
class
consciousness
,
provides
a
lens
through
which
we
can
examine
the
dynamics
of
social
classes
and
the
potential
for
change
.


Understanding
the
role
of
class
consciousness
in
empowering
the
proletariat
is
essential
for
comprehending
the
ongoing
debates
and
movements
aimed
at
creating
a
fairer
and
more
just
society
.

cannot
overlook
the
vital
role
played
by
the
proletariat
,
or
the
working
class
,
within
capitalist
societies
.


The
proletariat
forms
the
bedrock
of
the
labor
force
,
comprising
individuals
who
sell
their
labor
power
in
exchange
for
a
wage
.


While
the
bourgeoisie
,
or
the
capitalist
class
,
owns
and
controls
the
means
of
production
,
it
is
the
proletariat
that
toils
to
generate
wealth
and
sustain
the
capitalist
system
.


This
section
delves
into
the
significance
of
the
proletariat
,
exploring
their
position
within
capitalist
society
and
the
potential
for
class
consciousness
to
empower
them
.



1
.


The
Exploitation
of
Labor
:

Under
capitalism
,
the
proletariat
faces
exploitation
as
their
labor
power
is
commodified
and
sold
to
capitalists
.


They
are
compelled
to
work
for
wages
,
which
often
fail
to
reflect
the
true
value
of
their
labor
.


The
surplus
value
created
by
the
proletariat
'
s
labor
is
appropriated
by
the
bourgeoisie
,
leading
to
economic
disparities
and
class
divisions
.


For
instance
,
consider
the
factory
worker
who
spends
hours
toiling
on
an
assembly
line
,
only
to
receive
a
fraction
of
the
profits
generated
by
their
labor
.


This
exploitation
highlights
the
inherent
contradictions
within
capitalist
systems
.



2
.


Alienation
and
the
Proletariat
:

Marx
argued
that
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
alienates
the
proletariat
from
their
work
,
from
the
products
they
create
,
and
from
their
true
human
potential
.


The
assembly
line
worker
,
for
example
,
may
perform
repetitive
tasks
,
devoid
of
any
creative
or
intellectual
fulfillment
.


This
alienation
leads
to
a
sense
of
powerlessness
and
disconnection
from
their
labor
,
reinforcing
the
subjugation
of
the
working
class
.


It
is
through
class
consciousness
that
the
proletariat
can
recognize
and
challenge
this
alienation
,
paving
the
way
for
collective
action
.



3
.


Class
Consciousness
and
Revolutionary
Potential
:

Class
consciousness
refers
to
the
awareness
among
the
proletariat
of
their
shared
class
interests
and
the
recognition
of
the
exploitative
nature
of
capitalism
.


It
is
a
crucial
element
in
mobilizing
the
working
class
to
challenge
the
status
quo
and
strive
for
societal
change
.


When
the
proletariat
becomes
conscious
of
their
exploitation
,
they
can
unite
in
solidarity
to
demand
better
working
conditions
,
fair
wages
,
and
ultimately
,
the
overthrow
of
the
capitalist
system
.


Historical
examples
,
such
as
the
labor
movements
of
the
late
19th
and
early
20th
centuries
,
demonstrate
the
potential
for
class
consciousness
to
drive
revolutionary
change
.



4
.


Intersectionality
and
the
Proletariat
:

It
is
important
to
acknowledge
that
the
proletariat
is
not
a
homogenous
group
.


Intersectionality
plays
a
significant
role
in
shaping
the
experiences
and
struggles
of
different
segments
of
the
working
class
.


Factors
such
as
race
,
gender
,
and
ethnicity
intersect
with
class
,
influencing
the
level
of
exploitation
and
the
opportunities
available
to
individuals
within
the
proletariat
.


For
example
,
women
and
minority
workers
may
face
additional
layers
of
discrimination
and
marginalization
in
the
workplace
.


Recognizing
and
addressing
these
intersecting
oppressions
is
crucial
for
a
comprehensive
understanding
of
the
proletariat
and
the
fight
for
their
empowerment
.



5
.


The
Proletariat
'
s
Role
in
Social
Change
:

While
the
proletariat
faces
numerous
challenges
within
capitalist
society
,
their
collective
power
and
potential
for
social
change
should
not
be
underestimated
.


Through
organized
labor
movements
,
political
activism
,
and
the
pursuit
of
class
consciousness
,
the
working
class
can
challenge
the
existing
power
structures
and
strive
for
a
more
equitable
and
just
society
.


The
fight
for
workers
'

rights
,
the
demand
for
fair
wages
,
and
the
struggle
against
exploitative
working
conditions
all
exemplify
the
agency
and
transformative
potential
of
the
proletariat
.



Understanding
the
role
and
experiences
of
the
proletariat
within
capitalist
societies
is
crucial
for
comprehending
the
dynamics
of
class
struggle
and
envisioning
alternative
economic
systems
.


By
recognizing
their
exploitation
,
fostering
class
consciousness
,
and
addressing
intersecting
oppressions
,
the
working
class
can
empower
themselves
and
strive
for
a
more
equitable
world
.

The
Prospects
for
Empowering
the
Proletariat[Original
Blog]

In
the
realm
of
Marxian
economics
,
the
prospects
for
empowering
the
proletariat
stand
as
a
central
tenet
,
interwoven
with
the
very
fabric
of
class
consciousness
.


The
idea
of
a
class
struggle
that
transcends
borders
and
binds
workers
together
,
with
the
aim
of
dismantling
the
prevailing
capitalist
structures
,
has
been
the
cornerstone
of
Marxist
theory
.


But
what
does
this
mean
for
the
working
class
in
the
21st
century
?


As
we
delve
into
the
conclusion
of
our
exploration
,
we
uncover
a
nuanced
picture
of
the
potential
and
challenges
that
lie
ahead
.



1
.


Economic
Disparities
Persist
:
One
undeniable
reality
is
that
economic
inequalities
persist
across
the
globe
.


The
gap
between
the
working
class
and
the
bourgeoisie
remains
stark
,
and
this
has
fueled
the
call
for
the
proletariat
to
unite
and
demand
their
rightful
share
.


For
instance
,
the
top
1%
of
the
world
'
s
population
continues
to
amass
wealth
at
an
alarming
rate
,
while
many
workers
struggle
to
make
ends
meet
.


This
inequality
,
as
argued
by
Marxists
,
fuels
the
desire
for
class
consciousness
and
collective
action
.



2
.


Challenges
of
Modern
Capitalism
:
In
the
21st
century
,
capitalism
has
evolved
.


It
is
more
globalized
and
digitally
driven
,
which
presents
both
opportunities
and
challenges
for
the
working
class
.


The
gig
economy
,
for
example
,
has
introduced
new
dynamics
.


While
it
offers
flexibility
,
it
often
lacks
job
security
and
benefits
.


Here
,
the
proletariat
faces
the
challenge
of
adapting
Marxist
principles
to
these
changing
circumstances
,
such
as
organizing
gig
workers
to
demand
fair
wages
and
working
conditions
.



3
.


The
Role
of
Technology
:
Technology
has
revolutionized
the
way
we
work
and
communicate
.


The
rise
of
the
internet
and
social
media
provides
an
avenue
for
workers
to
connect
and
mobilize
on
a
global
scale
.


Movements
like
the
Fight
for
15
and
#MeToo
have
harnessed
the
power
of
social
media
to
amplify
their
messages
and
effect
change
.


This
signifies
that
the
working
class
can
utilize
modern
tools
to
build
class
consciousness
and
demand
justice
.



4
.


Global
Solidarity
:
The
global
nature
of
capitalism
necessitates
a
global
response
.


Workers
'

struggles
in
one
part
of
the
world
can
inspire
and
inform
those
in
other
regions
.


For
example
,
the
wave
of
workers
'

movements
across
Europe
can
serve
as
a
model
for
workers
in
the
Americas
and
beyond
.


Solidarity
and
international
cooperation
are
essential
for
empowering
the
proletariat
in
this
interconnected
world
.



5
.


Political
Engagement
:
Engaging
with
the
political
system
is
a
critical
aspect
of
empowering
the
working
class
.


Marxists
argue
for
a
transition
to
socialism
through
political
means
.


This
involves
participating
in
elections
and
supporting
candidates
who
champion
workers
'

rights
.


The
success
of
politicians
like
Bernie
Sanders
in
the
United
States
and
parties
like
Syriza
in
Greece
shows
that
there
is
political
potential
in
advancing
the
interests
of
the
proletariat
.



6
.


Education
and
Awareness
:
Building
class
consciousness
often
starts
with
education
and
awareness
.


Workers
need
to
understand
the
nature
of
their
exploitation
and
the
potential
for
change
.


Labor
unions
,
academic
institutions
,
and
grassroots
organizations
can
play
a
crucial
role
in
providing
resources
and
knowledge
to
the
working
class
.



The
prospects
for
empowering
the
proletariat
remain
both
promising
and
challenging
in
the
21st
century
.


Economic
disparities
,
the
evolution
of
capitalism
,
technology
,
global
solidarity
,
political
engagement
,
and
education
all
play
pivotal
roles
in
shaping
the
future
of
the
working
class
.


The
path
to
a
more
equitable
society
,
rooted
in
Marxist
principles
,
requires
a
comprehensive
understanding
of
these
dynamics
and
the
determination
to
effect
change
.


As
we
reflect
on
the
complex
landscape
of
class
consciousness
in
modern
times
,
the
struggle
continues
,
as
it
has
for
generations
,
toward
a
more
just
and
equitable
world
for
the
proletariat
.

Class
Struggle
and
Historical
Materialism[Original
Blog]

Class
Struggle

At
the
heart
of
Marxian
economics
lies
the
intricate
framework
of
dialectical
materialism
,
a
philosophical
underpinning
that
informs
not
only
the
economic
theories
of
Karl
Marx
but
also
broader
societal
analyses
.


Within
this
comprehensive
framework
,
one
crucial
aspect
is
the
interplay
between
class
struggle
and
historical
materialism
.


It
is
this
dynamic
relationship
that
unravels
the
core
of
Marxian
economics
,
shedding
light
on
the
development
and
transformation
of
societies
through
time
.



1
.


Historical
Materialism
'
s
Foundation
:

Historical
materialism
,
the
cornerstone
of
Marx
'
s
ideology
,
posits
that
the
material
conditions
of
a
society
are
the
primary
drivers
of
historical
change
.


This
perspective
acknowledges
the
importance
of
the
economic
base
of
society
,
which
includes
production
methods
,
ownership
of
means
of
production
,
and
class
structures
.


These
factors
set
the
stage
for
understanding
the
role
of
class
struggle
.



2
.


Class
Struggle
as
a
Motor
of
History
:

Class
struggle
emerges
when
there
is
a
fundamental
antagonism
of
interests
between
different
social
classes
,
primarily
the
bourgeoisie
(owners
of
capital)
and
the
proletariat
(working
class)
.


This
perpetual
struggle
shapes
the
course
of
history
as
it
propels
societal
evolution
.


For
instance
,
the
Industrial
Revolution
in
the
19th
century
marked
a
crucial
point
in
history
when
the
conflict
between
factory
owners
and
laborers
intensified
,
leading
to
significant
societal
changes
.



3
.


The
Bourgeoisie
and
Proletariat
:

The
bourgeoisie
controls
the
means
of
production
,
wielding
economic
power
,
while
the
proletariat
sells
their
labor
to
survive
.


This
class
division
highlights
how
economic
inequality
is
intrinsic
to
capitalism
.


The
tension
between
these
classes
becomes
a
driving
force
behind
historical
shifts
.



4
.


Modes
of
Production
:

Within
the
dialectical
materialist
framework
,
modes
of
production
are
pivotal
.


Feudalism
,
capitalism
,
and
socialism
are
examples
of
different
modes
.


As
society
progresses
,
transitions
from
one
mode
to
another
are
often
accompanied
by
profound
class
struggles
.


The
French
Revolution
,
with
its
radical
shift
from
feudalism
to
capitalism
,
exemplifies
this
.



5
.


Class
Consciousness
:

Marx
emphasized
the
significance
of
class
consciousness
,
the
awareness
of
one
'
s
social
class
and
the
recognition
of
shared
class
interests
.


When
the
proletariat
gains
class
consciousness
,
it
can
collectively
challenge
the
bourgeoisie
.


The
Russian
Revolution
,
guided
by
the
Bolsheviks
,
illustrates
how
class
consciousness
can
lead
to
revolutionary
change
.



6
.


Capitalism
'
s
Contradictions
:

Capitalism
,
according
to
Marx
,
contains
inherent
contradictions
.


One
of
these
is
the
tendency
of
the
rate
of
profit
to
fall
over
time
.


This
,
along
with
recurring
economic
crises
,
heightens
class
antagonisms
and
underscores
the
idea
that
capitalism
contains
the
seeds
of
its
own
destruction
.



7
.


Global
Implications
:

Class
struggle
is
not
confined
to
individual
nations
;
it
is
a
global
phenomenon
.


The
struggles
of
workers
in
different
countries
are
interconnected
,
as
illustrated
by
the
international
labor
movement
.


This
global
perspective
is
crucial
for
understanding
modern
economic
systems
and
globalization
.



In
the
synthesis
of
class
struggle
and
historical
materialism
,
we
find
a
lens
through
which
to
scrutinize
the
evolution
of
societies
and
economic
systems
.


This
dynamic
interaction
continues
to
shape
the
world
we
live
in
,
and
it
remains
central
to
understanding
the
intricate
web
of
Marxian
economics
and
its
broader
implications
for
the
study
of
human
history
and
progress
.

Introduction
to
Friedrich
Engels
and
the
Proletariat[Original
Blog]

Friedrich
Engels
was
a
German
philosopher
,
social
scientist
,
and
communist
revolutionary
who
co-wrote
The
Communist
Manifesto
with
Karl
Marx
.


Engels
,
through
his
works
,
has
made
significant
contributions
to
the
understanding
of
the
working
class
and
the
role
of
the
proletariat
in
society
.


The
concept
of
the
proletariat
,
as
defined
by
Engels
,
refers
to
the
working-class
people
who
do
not
own
the
means
of
production
and
are
forced
to
sell
their
labor
to
survive
.


Engels
believed
that
the
proletariat
is
the
driving
force
behind
revolution
and
the
eventual
overthrow
of
the
bourgeoisie
.



Understanding
the
concept
of
the
proletariat
and
how
it
was
developed
by
Friedrich
Engels
is
crucial
to
understanding
the
history
of
communism
and
socialism
.


In
this
section
,
we
will
delve
deeper
into
Engels
'

concept
of
the
working
class
and
the
role
of
the
proletariat
in
society
.



1
.


The
Origin
of
the
Proletariat

Engels
believed
that
the
proletariat
emerged
as
a
result
of
the
Industrial
Revolution
.


The
introduction
of
machines
and
the
growth
of
industry
led
to
the
creation
of
a
new
class
of
people
who
were
forced
to
work
in
factories
for
low
wages
.


These
workers
were
often
subjected
to
poor
working
conditions
and
long
hours
,
leading
to
the
rise
of
trade
unions
and
the
labor
movement
.



2
.


The
Role
of
the
Proletariat

Engels
believed
that
the
proletariat
had
a
crucial
role
to
play
in
society
.


He
argued
that
the
working
class
was
the
only
group
that
had
the
power
to
overthrow
the
bourgeoisie
and
establish
a
socialist
society
.


Engels
believed
that
the
proletariat
would
eventually
become
conscious
of
their
own
power
and
rise
up
against
their
oppressors
.



3
.


The
Alienation
of
the
Proletariat

Engels
also
wrote
about
the
alienation
of
the
proletariat
.


He
argued
that
the
workers
were
alienated
from
the
products
of
their
labor
and
from
the
means
of
production
.


He
believed
that
this
alienation
led
to
a
sense
of
powerlessness
and
despair
among
the
working
class
.



4
.


The
Importance
of
Class
Consciousness

Engels
believed
that
class
consciousness
was
crucial
for
the
proletariat
to
achieve
their
goals
.


He
argued
that
the
workers
needed
to
recognize
their
shared
interests
and
unite
against
their
oppressors
.


Engels
believed
that
the
development
of
class
consciousness
would
eventually
lead
to
the
overthrow
of
the
bourgeoisie
and
the
establishment
of
a
socialist
society
.



Friedrich

wrote
about
the
alienation
of

Class
Struggle

Class
struggle
is
at
the
heart
of
Marxian
economics
,
and
it
serves
as
the
driving
force
behind
the
development
of

.


In
this
section
of
the
blog
,
we
delve
into
the
intricate
relationship
between
class
struggle
and
historical

,
exploring
its
implications
and
significance
.


It
is
essential
to
understand
that
Marx
'
s
perspective
on
class
struggle
and
historical
materialism
is
not
without
controversy
,
and
various
viewpoints
exist
regarding
its
interpretation
.



1
.


Class
Struggle
as
the
Engine
of
History
:
According
to
Marx
,
history
is
not
just
a
sequence
of
random
events
but
a
result
of
the
ongoing
struggle
between
different
social
classes
.


The
conflict
between
the
bourgeoisie
(owners
of
the
means
of
production)
and
the
proletariat
(the
working
class)
is
the
central
dynamic
that
shapes
societal
change
.


The
bourgeoisie
'
s
pursuit
of
profit
through
the
exploitation
of
labor
leads
to
a
perpetual
struggle
with
the
working
class
,
and
this
struggle
is
what
propels
historical
development
.



2
.


Material
Conditions
and
Ideology
:
Historical
materialism
asserts
that
material
conditions
,
particularly
economic
factors
,
play
a
primary
role
in
shaping
human
history
.


It
is
the
mode
of
production
in
any
given
society
that
influences
the
social
and
political
structures
.


This
idea
suggests
that
the
dominant
class
shapes
the
prevailing
ideology
to
maintain
its
power
.


For
example
,
in
a
capitalist
society
,
the
ideology
often
promotes
individualism
and
competition
to
serve
the
interests
of
the
bourgeoisie
.



3
.


Class
Consciousness
:
Marx
believed
that
the
proletariat
would
eventually
develop
class
consciousness
an
awareness
of
their
collective
interests
and
the
oppressive
nature
of
the
capitalist
system
.


When
the
working
class
realizes
its
exploitation
and
unites
in
pursuit
of
its
own
interests
,
it
becomes
a
potent
force
for
change
.


The
labor
movements
and
strikes
throughout
history
,
like
the
rise
of
trade
unions
in
the
19th
century
,
serve
as
examples
of
this
growing
class
consciousness
.



4
.


Historical
Transformation
and
Revolution
:
Historical
materialism
suggests
that
societies
evolve
through
a
series
of
stages
driven
by
class
struggle
.


Ultimately
,
Marx
anticipated
a
proletarian
revolution
that
would
lead
to
the
overthrow
of
capitalism
and
the
establishment
of
a
classless
,
communist
society
.


The
Russian
Revolution
of
1917
is
often
cited
as
an
attempt
to
put
this
theory
into
practice
,
although
the
outcome
did
not
align
precisely
with
Marx
'
s
vision
.



5
.


Critiques
and
Contemporary
Relevance
:
While
Marx
'
s
theories
have
been
influential
,
they
are
not
without
criticism
.


Some
argue
that
historical
materialism
oversimplifies
the
complexity
of
historical
change
,
neglecting
cultural
and
ideological
factors
.


Moreover
,
critics
question
whether
a
purely
class-based
revolution
is
achievable
or
desirable
in
contemporary
society
.


However
,
class
struggle
remains
relevant
in
discussions
of
income
inequality
,
worker
'
s
rights
,
and
the
global
distribution
of
wealth
.



6
.


Intersectionality
:
An
emerging
perspective
integrates
class
struggle
with
other
forms
of
oppression
,
such
as
race
and
gender
.


Intersectional
theorists
argue
that
an
individual
'
s
experience
of
class
struggle
is
intertwined
with
their
experiences
of
other
forms
of
discrimination
,
leading
to
a
more
nuanced
understanding
of
social
dynamics
.



In
summary
,
class
struggle
is
a
fundamental
concept
within
the
framework
of
historical
materialism
,
according
to
Marx
.


It
drives
historical
change
and
is
intrinsically
tied
to
the
development
of
class
consciousness
,
which
can
lead
to
revolutionary
transformation
.


However
,
the
practical
application
of
these
ideas
,
as
well
as
their
contemporary
relevance
,
continues
to
be
subjects
of
debate
and
exploration
in
the
realm
of
social
and
economic
theory
.

The
Role
of
Class
Struggle
in
Marxian
Economics[Original
Blog]

Class
Struggle

Class
struggle
lies
at
the
very
heart
of
Marxian
economics
,
serving
as
a
fundamental
pillar
of
Karl
Marx
'
s
socio-economic
theory
.


This
concept
encapsulates
the
ongoing
conflict
between
the
working
class
,
referred
to
as
the
proletariat
,
and
the
capitalist
class
,
known
as
the
bourgeoisie
.


Marx
'
s
analysis
of
class
struggle
and
its
central
role
in
his
economic
thought
has
had
a
profound
influence
on
the
development
of
communism
as
a
visionary
ideal
.



1
.


Historical
Context
:

To
understand
the
significance
of
class
struggle
in
Marxian
economics
,
it
is
crucial
to
delve
into
the
historical
context
in
which
Marx
formulated
his
theories
.


The
19th
century
was
a
time
of
rapid
industrialization
and
societal
change
,
with
the
industrial
revolution
reshaping
economic
structures
.


This
period
saw
the
emergence
of
stark
class
divisions
between
the
industrial
working
class
,
often
enduring
dire
working
conditions
and
low
wages
,
and
the
bourgeoisie
,
who
held
power
and
wealth
.



2
.


Exploitation
of
Labor
:

One
of
the
central
tenets
of
Marxian
economics
is
the
idea
that
the
capitalist
system
inherently
exploits
the
labor
of
the
working
class
.


The
bourgeoisie
,
who
own
the
means
of
production
,
extract
surplus
value
from
the
labor
of
the
proletariat
.


This
surplus
value
represents
the
difference
between
the
value
of
the
goods
and
services
produced
by
the
workers
and
the
wages
they
receive
.


Marx
argued
that
this
exploitation
perpetuates
economic
inequality
and
class
conflict
.



3
.


Alienation
of
Labor
:

Marx
also
emphasized
the
alienation
of
labor
in
a
capitalist
society
.


He
believed
that
as
workers
produce
goods
,
they
become
increasingly
disconnected
from
the
products
of
their
labor
,
which
are
ultimately
controlled
by
the
bourgeoisie
.


This
alienation
not
only
leads
to
disempowerment
but
also
fosters
a
sense
of
detachment
from
the
work
itself
,
contributing
to
worker
dissatisfaction
.



4
.


Class
Consciousness
:

A
key
aspect
of
Marxian
economics
is
the
concept
of
class
consciousness
.


This
refers
to
the
awareness
and
unity
of
the
working
class
in
recognizing
their
shared
interests
and
common
struggle
against
the
bourgeoisie
.


Marx
envisioned
that
as
workers
gained
class
consciousness
,
they
would
become
more
inclined
to
challenge
the
existing
system
and
seek
a
transformation
of
society
.



5
.


Revolutionary
Change
:

Marx
believed
that
class
struggle
would
inevitably
lead
to
revolutionary
change
.


The
intensification
of
conflict
between
the
proletariat
and
the
bourgeoisie
,
fueled
by
economic
disparities
and
exploitation
,
would
culminate
in
a
revolution
that
would
overthrow
the
capitalist
system
.


The
ultimate
goal
was
the
establishment
of
a
classless
,
communist
society
where
the
means
of
production
were
collectively
owned
and
wealth
distributed
equitably
.



6
.


Criticisms
and
Alternative
Views
:

It
'
s
important
to
note
that
Marx
'
s
perspective
on
class
struggle
in
economics
has
not
been
without
criticism
.


Some
argue
that
his
predictions
of
inevitable
revolution
have
not
materialized
as
he
envisioned
.


Others
assert
that
class
divisions
have
evolved
,
and
capitalism
has
adapted
to
address
certain
social
issues
.


Furthermore
,
alternative
economic
theories
propose
different
solutions
to
class
disparities
.



7
.


Contemporary
Relevance
:

Class
struggle
remains
a
relevant
and
often
contentious
topic
in
contemporary
economic
discourse
.


While
some
view
it
as
a
driving
force
behind
movements
advocating
for
workers
'

rights
and
wealth
redistribution
,
others
argue
that
globalization
and
changing
economic
structures
have
shifted
the
dynamics
of
class
conflict
in
the
21st
century
.



In
summary
,
the
role
of
class
struggle
in
Marxian
economics
is
a
central
theme
that
highlights
the
inherent
conflict
between
the
proletariat
and
bourgeoisie
in
a
capitalist
society
.


It
forms
the
basis
for
Marx
'
s
vision
of
communism
as
a
solution
to
the
exploitation
and
alienation
of
the
working
class
.


Despite
criticisms
and
evolving
economic
landscapes
,
the
concept
of
class
struggle
continues
to
shape
discussions
on
social
and
economic
inequality
.

Social

Ethical
considerations
when
using
social

###
Understanding
Class
Consciousness

Class
consciousness
refers
to
an
individual
'
s
awareness
of
their
social
class
and
its
implications
.


It
encompasses
not
only
economic
factors
(such
as
income
and
occupation)
but
also
cultural
,
educational
,
and
lifestyle
aspects
.


Here
are
some
insights
from
different
perspectives
:

1
.


Marxist
Viewpoint
:

-
Karl
Marx
emphasized
class
struggle
and
the
division
between
the
bourgeoisie
(capitalist
class)
and
the
proletariat
(working
class)
.


From
this
perspective
,
class
consciousness
is
essential
for
social
change
and
revolution
.



-
Ethical
Consideration
:
While
acknowledging
class
differences
is
crucial
,
reducing
individuals
solely
to
their
class
identity
can
be
reductionist
and
dehumanizing
.



2
.


Weberian
Perspective
:

-
Max
Weber
introduced
the
concept
of
social
stratification
,
which
includes
economic
,
social
,
and
cultural
dimensions
.


He
emphasized
the
role
of
status
and
power
alongside
class
.



-
Ethical
Consideration
:
Recognizing
the
complexity
of
social
class
allows
for
a
more
nuanced
segmentation
approach
.


Avoid
oversimplification
.



###
Ethical
Dilemmas
in
Social
Class
Segmentation

1
.


Stereotyping
and
Stigmatization
:

-
Marketers
often
rely
on
stereotypes
associated
with
different
social
classes
.


For
instance
,
assuming
that
luxury
car
buyers
belong
to
the
upper
class
.



-
Ethical
Consideration
:
Stereotypes
can
perpetuate
inequality
and
reinforce
biases
.


Marketers
should
avoid
reinforcing
negative
stereotypes
.



2
.


Privacy
and
Data
Collection
:

-
Collecting
data
on
social
class
(e
.

g
.


,
income
,
education)
can
invade
privacy
.


Consumers
may
feel
uncomfortable
sharing
such
personal
information
.



-
Ethical
Consideration
:
Transparency
and
informed
consent
are
crucial
.


Marketers
should
clearly
communicate
data
collection
purposes
and
allow
opt-in/opt-out
choices
.



3
.


Targeting
Vulnerable
Groups
:

-
Segmentation
can
inadvertently
target
vulnerable
populations
(e
.

g
.


,
low-income
families)
with
products
they
can
'
t
afford
.



-
Ethical
Consideration
:
Responsible
marketing
involves
considering
the
impact
on
vulnerable
groups
.


Avoid
predatory
practices
.



###
Examples

1
.


Healthcare
Services
:

-
A
pharmaceutical
company
targeting
high-income
individuals
for
a
new
drug
may
inadvertently
exclude
lower-income
patients
who
need
it
.



-
Ethical
Approach
:
Ensure
accessibility
and
affordability
for
all
segments
.



2
.


Education
Marketing
:

-
Elite
schools
targeting
affluent
families
may
perpetuate
educational
inequality
.



-
Ethical
Approach
:
Promote
scholarships
and
outreach
programs
to
diversify
student
populations
.



3
.


Luxury
Brands
:

-
Luxury
brands
often
emphasize
exclusivity
.


However
,
this
can
alienate
middle-class
consumers
.



-
Ethical
Approach
:
Balance
exclusivity
with
inclusivity
.


Highlight
craftsmanship
rather
than
elitism
.



In
summary
,
social
class
segmentation
is
a
powerful
tool
for
marketers
,
but
it
comes
with
ethical
responsibilities
.


By
understanding
class
consciousness
,
avoiding
stereotypes
,
respecting
privacy
,
and
considering
vulnerable
groups
,
we
can
create
more
equitable
marketing
strategies
.


Remember
,
ethical
marketing
benefits
both
businesses
and
society
at
large
.

Defining
Social
Status
and
Class
Consciousness[Original
Blog]

###
The
Complex
Landscape
of
Social
Status
and
Class
Consciousness

Social
status
refers
to
an
individual
'
s
position
within
a
social
hierarchy
.


It
encompasses
various
dimensions
,
including
wealth
,
occupation
,
education
,
and
lifestyle
.


Class
consciousness
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
the
awareness
of
one
'
s
social
class
and
the
recognition
of
shared
interests
and
experiences
with
others
in
the
same
class
.


Let
'
s
break
down
these
concepts
further
:

1
.


Social
Stratification
:
Layers
of
Society

-
Societies
are
stratified
into
different
layers
or
strata
.


These
layers
can
be
broadly
categorized
as
upper
class
,
middle
class
,
and
lower
class
.


Each
stratum
has
distinct
characteristics
,
privileges
,
and
challenges
.



-
Upper
Class
:
This
elite
group
comprises
the
wealthiest
individuals
.


They
have
significant
economic
resources
,
access
to
exclusive
networks
,
and
often
wield
considerable
influence
.


Examples
include
business
tycoons
,
celebrities
,
and
heirs
to
family
fortunes
.



-
Middle
Class
:
The
middle
class
is
diverse
and
heterogeneous
.


It
includes
professionals
,
managers
,
and
skilled
workers
.


They
value
education
,
stability
,
and
upward
mobility
.


The
middle
class
is
often
associated
with
the
"American
Dream
.

"

-
Lower
Class
:
Individuals
in
the
lower
class
face
economic
hardships
,
limited
opportunities
,
and
social
stigma
.


They
may
work
in
low-paying
jobs
,
struggle
with
basic
needs
,
and
lack
access
to
quality
education
and
healthcare
.



2
.


The
Intersection
of
Wealth
and
Power

-
Social
status
is
closely
tied
to
wealth
and
power
.


Those
with
economic
resources
can
shape
policies
,
influence
institutions
,
and
maintain
their
privileged
positions
.



-
Example
:
Imagine
a
successful
tech
entrepreneur
who
not
only
accumulates
wealth
but
also
uses
it
to
fund
political
campaigns
or
philanthropic
initiatives
.


Their
influence
extends
beyond
their
bank
account
.



3
.


Cultural
Capital
and
Symbolic
Boundaries

-
French
sociologist
Pierre
Bourdieu
introduced
the
concept
of
cultural
capital
.


It
refers
to
non-financial
assets
such
as
education
,
knowledge
,
and
cultural
tastes
.


Cultural
capital
affects
an
individual
'
s
social
mobility
and
acceptance
.



-
Example
:
A
person
who
appreciates
classical
music
,
speaks
multiple
languages
,
and
frequents
art
galleries
may
be
perceived
differently
from
someone
with
different
cultural
preferences
.



4
.


Class
Consciousness
and
Solidarity

-
Class
consciousness
emerges
when
individuals
recognize
their
shared
interests
and
challenges
based
on
their
social
class
.


It
fosters
solidarity
and
collective
action
.



-
Example
:
During
labor
strikes
,
workers
unite
to
demand
better
wages
and
working
conditions
.


Their
class
consciousness
drives
their
activism
.



5
.


Social
Mobility
:
Upward
and
Downward

-
Social
mobility
refers
to
movement
between
social
strata
.


Upward
mobility
occurs
when
individuals
improve
their
social
status
(e
.

g
.


,
moving
from
working-class
to
middle-class)
.


Downward
mobility
is
the
reverse
.



-
Example
:
A
first-generation
college
graduate
who
secures
a
professional
job
achieves
upward
mobility
.



6
.


Challenges
and
Stereotypes

-
Stereotypes
often
shape
perceptions
of
social
status
.


These
biases
can
lead
to
discrimination
and
reinforce
existing
inequalities
.



-
Example
:
The
stereotype
that
all
wealthy
people
are
snobbish
or
that
all
lower-class
individuals
lack
ambition
.



In
summary
,
social
status
and
class
consciousness
are
multifaceted
phenomena
.


They
influence
our
choices
,
interactions
,
and
life
trajectories
.


As
marketers
,
understanding
these
dynamics
helps
us
tailor
messages
and
products
to
specific
audiences
.


As
humans
,
recognizing
our
own
class
consciousness
allows
us
to
empathize
with
others
and
work
toward
a
more
equitable
society
.



Remember
,
,
but
they
provide
a
solid
foundation
for
further
exploration

Class
Structure
in
Marxian
Theory[Original
Blog]

In
the
grand
tapestry
of
Marxian
economic
analysis
,
one
cannot
help
but
be
drawn
to
the
intricate
web
of
class
structures
that
Marx
himself
wove
into
his
theories
.


Central
to
the
very
essence
of
his
work
,
class
structure
plays
a
pivotal
role
in
understanding
the
dynamics
of
society
,
power
,
and
inequality
.


While
Karl
Marx
'
s
ideas
were
developed
in
the
19th
century
,
they
remain
as
relevant
today
as
they
were
in
his
time
,
sparking
ongoing
debates
and
discussions
among
scholars
and
thinkers
.


This
section
delves
into
the
core
concept
of
class
structure
in
Marxian
theory
,
offering
insights
from
various
perspectives
and
employing
examples
to
elucidate
these
intricate
concepts
.



1
.


The
Fundamental
Division
-
Bourgeoisie
and
Proletariat
:

At
the
heart
of
Marx
'
s
class
structure
lies
the
binary
division
of
society
into
two
primary
classes
:
the
bourgeoisie
and
the
proletariat
.


The
bourgeoisie
,
often
referred
to
as
the
capitalist
class
,
own
the
means
of
production
and
wield
economic
power
.


In
contrast
,
the
proletariat
consists
of
the
laborers
and
workers
who
,
lacking
the
means
of
production
,
must
sell
their
labor
to
survive
.


This
dichotomy
encapsulates
the
core
tension
of
Marxian
theory
,
the
struggle
between
those
who
control
capital
and
those
who
provide
the
labor
.



2
.


The
Role
of
the
Bourgeoisie
:

The
bourgeoisie
'
s
control
over
the
means
of
production
gives
them
immense
influence
not
only
in
the
economic
realm
but
also
in
the
political
and
social
spheres
.


They
determine
the
allocation
of
resources
,
set
the
agenda
,
and
frame
societal
structures
to
maintain
their
dominance
.


A
classic
example
is
the
industrial
revolution
,
which
saw
the
bourgeoisie
amassing
vast
wealth
while
the
working
class
endured
harsh
working
conditions
and
minimal
wages
.

.


The
Struggles
of
the
Proletariat
:

For
the
proletariat
,
life
under
capitalism
is
marked
by
insecurity
,
exploitation
,
and
alienation
.


They
work
long
hours
for
minimal
pay
,
often
unable
to
break
free
from
the
cycle
of
poverty
.


Their
plight
is
exemplified
by
historical
events
like
the
labor
strikes
of
the
late
19th
and
early
20th
centuries
,
where
workers
fought
for
better
wages
,
shorter
working
hours
,
and
improved
working
conditions
.

.


Class
Consciousness
:

One
of
Marx
'
s
key
ideas
is
the
development
of
class
consciousness
among
the
proletariat
.


It
refers
to
the
realization
of
their
shared
interests
and
the
understanding
that
their
oppression
is
a
result
of
the
capitalist
system
.


An
illustrative
example
is
the
rise
of
labor
unions
and
socialist
movements
,
where
workers
joined
forces
to
demand
their
rights
and
challenge
the
bourgeoisie
'
s
supremacy
.



5
.


The
Middle
Class
-
A
Complex
Entity
:

While
Marx
'
s
theory
primarily
focuses
on
the
bourgeoisie
and
proletariat
,
the
emergence
of
the
middle
class
complicates
this
binary
view
.


The
middle
class
,
including
small
business
owners
and
professionals
,
often
find
themselves
in
a
gray
area
,
as
they
may
experience
aspects
of
both
exploitation
and
privilege
.


This
complexity
has
spurred
debates
on
their
role
within
the
class
structure
.



6
.


Contemporary
Relevance
:

Marx
'
s
analysis
of
class
structure
remains
influential
today
.


The
modern
gig
economy
,
with
its
precarious
work
arrangements
,
reflects
the
ongoing
struggle
of
the
proletariat
.


Additionally
,
discussions
around
income
inequality
and
the
concentration
of
wealth
in
the
hands
of
a
few
resonate
with
Marx
'
s
concerns
about
the
bourgeoisie
'
s
power
.



7
.


Critiques
and
Evolutions
:

It
'
s
essential
to
acknowledge
that
Marx
'
s
class
structure
model
has
faced
critiques
and
adaptations
over
time
.


Some
argue
that
factors
like
race
,
gender
,
and
identity
should
be
incorporated
into
a
more
comprehensive
class
analysis
.


Others
contend
that
the
collapse
of
traditional
class
divisions
in
advanced
capitalist
societies
requires
a
reevaluation
of
Marx
'
s
theory
.



8
.


Conclusion
:

The
concept
of
class
structure
in
Marxian
theory
serves
as
the
backbone
of
his
economic
analysis
,
illuminating
the
power
dynamics
and
social
hierarchies
inherent
in
capitalist
societies
.


By
examining
the
roles
of
the
bourgeoisie
and
proletariat
,
understanding
class
consciousness
,
and
recognizing
the
evolving
nature
of
class
divisions
,
we
can
better
grasp
the
ongoing
relevance
and
complexity
of
Marx
'
s
ideas
in
today
'
s
world
.

Class
Struggle
and
the
Role
of
the
Proletariat[Original
Blog]

Class
Struggle

Class
struggle
and
the
role
of
the
proletariat
are
central
concepts
in
Marxian
economics
,
reflecting
the
radical
roots
of
heterodoxy
.


These
ideas
revolve
around
the
belief
that
society
is
divided
into
two
main
classes
,
the
bourgeoisie
(the
capitalist
class)
and
the
proletariat
(the
working
class)
,
and
that
the
inherent
conflict
between
them
drives
historical
and
social
change
.


The
bourgeoisie
,
who
own
the
means
of
production
,
seek
to
maximize
their
profits
by
exploiting
the
labor
of
the
proletariat
,
who
have
no
choice
but
to
sell
their
labor
power
to
survive
.


This
unequal
power
dynamic
creates
a
perpetual
struggle
between
the
two
classes
,
as
the
bourgeoisie
aim
to
maintain
their
dominance
while
the
proletariat
strive
for
better
working
conditions
,
higher
wages
,
and
ultimately
,
the
overthrow
of
the
capitalist
system
.



1
.


Historical
Materialism
:
Marxists
argue
that
the
class
struggle
is
not
a
mere
ideological
or
political
conflict
,
but
a
material
one
rooted
in
the
economic
relations
of
production
.


Marx
developed
the
concept
of
historical
materialism
to
understand
how
different
modes
of
production
throughout
history
have
shaped
the
class
struggle
.


For
instance
,
in
feudal
societies
,
the
conflict
was
between
the
feudal
lords
and
the
serfs
,
while
in
capitalist
societies
,
it
is
between
the
bourgeoisie
and
the
proletariat
.


Historical
materialism
provides
a
framework
for
analyzing
the
dynamics
of
class
struggle
across
different
historical
periods
and
societies
.



2
.


Exploitation
of
Labor
:
The
capitalist
mode
of
production
relies
on
the
extraction
of
surplus
value
from
the
labor
of
the
proletariat
.


Capitalists
pay
workers
a
wage
that
is
less
than
the
value
they
produce
,
resulting
in
the
exploitation
of
their
labor
.


This
surplus
value
is
then
accumulated
as
profit
by
the
bourgeoisie
.


The
perpetual
need
to
accumulate
capital
drives
capitalists
to
constantly
increase
the
intensity
and
duration
of
labor
,
leading
to
worsening
working
conditions
and
alienation
for
the
proletariat
.



3
.


Alienation
:
Marx
argued
that
under
capitalism
,
the
proletariat
becomes
alienated
from
their
labor
,
themselves
,
and
their
fellow
workers
.


Due
to
the
division
of
labor
and
the
commodification
of
labor
power
,
workers
are
reduced
to
mere
cogs
in
the
capitalist
machine
,
where
their
work
becomes
a
means
of
survival
rather
than
a
source
of
fulfillment
.


This
alienation
from
the
product
of
their
labor
and
the
process
itself
creates
a
sense
of
powerlessness
and
disconnect
,
further
fueling
the
class
struggle
.



4
.


Class
Consciousness
:
Marx
believed
that
the
proletariat
,
through
their
shared
experiences
of
exploitation
and
alienation
,
would
develop
class
consciousness
–
an
understanding
of
their
collective
interests
and
the
need
for
revolutionary
action
.


Class
consciousness
enables
the
proletariat
to
recognize
their
role
as
a
revolutionary
class
and
to
unite
in
their
struggle
against
the
bourgeoisie
.


It
is
through
class
consciousness
that
the
proletariat
can
challenge
the
dominant
ideology
perpetuated
by
the
ruling
class
and
envision
an
alternative
society
based
on
socialist
principles
.



5
.


Role
of
the
Proletariat
:
The
proletariat
,
as
the
largest
and
most
exploited
class
in
capitalist
societies
,
plays
a
crucial
role
in
the
class
struggle
.


Marx
argued
that
the
proletariat
,
once
conscious
of
their
collective
power
,
would
rise
up
against
the
bourgeoisie
,
overthrow
capitalism
,
and
establish
a
classless
society
.


This
revolutionary
role
of
the
proletariat
is
seen
as
a
historical
necessity
,
driven
by
the
contradictions
and
inherent
instability
of
the
capitalist
system
.



6
.


Revolutionary
Potential
:
The
revolutionary
potential
of
the
proletariat
is
often
debated
among
Marxists
.


Some
argue
that
the
increasing
precarity
and
exploitation
faced
by
the
working
class
in
contemporary
capitalism
will
inevitably
lead
to
a
revolutionary
uprising
.


Others
contend
that
the
fragmentation
and
diversification
of
the
working
class
,
along
with
the
co-optation
of
certain
segments
through
higher
wages
and
benefits
,
may
hinder
the
development
of
a
unified
revolutionary
force
.


Nevertheless
,
the
role
of
the
proletariat
in
challenging
the
capitalist
system
remains
a
central
tenet
of
Marxian
economics
.



The
concept
of
class
struggle
and
the
role
of
the
proletariat
are
fundamental
to
understanding
Marxian
economics
.


The
perpetual
conflict
between
the
bourgeoisie
and
the
proletariat
,
driven
by
exploitation
and
alienation
,
forms
the
basis
for
social
change
and
the
potential
for
revolutionary
transformation
.


While
the
revolutionary
potential
of
the
proletariat
may
be
subject
to
debate
,
the
analysis
of
class
struggle
provides
a
critical
lens
through
which
to
examine
the
dynamics
of
power
and
inequality
in
capitalist
societies
.

The
Concept
of
the
Bourgeoisie[Original
Blog]

The
Concept
of
the
Bourgeoisie
is
a
central
element
of
Marxian
economics
,
and
it
plays
a
pivotal
role
in
understanding
class
struggle
and
the
dynamics
of
capitalist
societies
.


The
term
"bourgeoisie"
refers
to
the
capitalist
class
or
the
owners
of
the
means
of
production
,
such
as
factories
,
businesses
,
and
land
.


This
class
is
distinct
from
the
working
class
,
known
as
the
proletariat
,
who
sell
their
labor
to
the
bourgeoisie
in
exchange
for
wages
.


The
concept
of
the
bourgeoisie
is
multifaceted
and
has
been
analyzed
from
various
perspectives
,
providing
a
nuanced
understanding
of
its
role
in
society
.



1
.


Historical
Evolution
of
the
Bourgeoisie
:

The
concept
of
the
bourgeoisie
has
a
historical
context
.


It
emerged
as
a
distinct
class
during
the
transition
from
feudalism
to
capitalism
.


In
the
18th
and
19th
centuries
,
with
the
rise
of
industrialization
,
the
bourgeoisie
gained
economic
power
and
influence
.


They
were
instrumental
in
shaping
the
modern
capitalist
system
,
which
shifted
the
balance
of
power
from
the
aristocracy
to
the
capitalist
class
.


An
example
of
this
can
be
seen
in
the
Industrial
Revolution
,
where
the
bourgeoisie
invested
in
new
technologies
and
industries
,
leading
to
significant
societal
changes
.



2
.


Economic
Exploitation
:

Marxian
economics
argues
that
the
bourgeoisie
maintains
its
power
through
the
exploitation
of
the
proletariat
.


The
bourgeoisie
profits
by
paying
workers
less
than
the
value
of
their
labor
,
resulting
in
surplus
value
.


This
surplus
value
is
a
fundamental
source
of
wealth
for
the
bourgeoisie
,
as
they
accumulate
capital
by
extracting
it
from
the
working
class
.


This
economic
relationship
is
exemplified
by
the
wage
labor
system
,
where
workers
produce
goods
or
services
for
their
employers
in
exchange
for
a
wage
,
while
the
bourgeoisie
reaps
the
profits
.



3
.


Class
Consciousness
:

Understanding
the
bourgeoisie
also
involves
the
concept
of
"class
consciousness
.

"
Marx
argued
that
the
bourgeoisie
had
a
clear
understanding
of
their
class
interests
and
sought
to
protect
and
expand
their
economic
power
.


This
consciousness
led
to
the
development
of
institutions
,
such
as
corporations
and
financial
markets
,
that
furthered
their
interests
.


The
bourgeoisie
'
s
ability
to
shape
economic
policies
in
their
favor
highlights
the
influence
of
class
consciousness
in
maintaining
their
position
.



4
.


Contradictions
and
Crises
:

An
important
aspect
of
the
bourgeoisie
is
its
role
in
creating
contradictions
within
the
capitalist
system
.


Marx
posited
that
capitalism
inherently
contains
contradictions
and
crises
due
to
the
pursuit
of
profit
and
competition
among
capitalists
.


These
crises
,
such
as
economic
recessions
and
financial
instability
,
can
have
widespread
consequences
for
society
.


The
2008
financial
crisis
serves
as
a
modern
example
of
how
the
actions
and
decisions
of
the
bourgeoisie
can
lead
to
systemic
crises
.



5
.


Global
Bourgeoisie
:

The
concept
of
the
bourgeoisie
extends
beyond
national
borders
.


In
a
globalized
world
,
the
bourgeoisie
is
not
limited
to
one
country
but
forms
a
transnational
elite
.


They
benefit
from
the
global
movement
of
capital
and
resources
,
often
at
the
expense
of
workers
in
less
developed
countries
.


Multinational
corporations
and
international
financial
institutions
are
powerful
entities
representing
the
interests
of
the
global
bourgeoisie
.


This
globalization
of
capitalism
has
led
to
debates
about
inequality
on
a
global
scale
.



6
.


Challenges
to
the
Bourgeoisie
:

While
the
bourgeoisie
has
maintained
its
power
for
centuries
,
it
is
not
without
challenges
.


Movements
advocating
for
workers
'

rights
,
wealth
redistribution
,
and
social
justice
have
questioned
the
concentration
of
power
and
wealth
in
the
hands
of
the
bourgeoisie
.


Examples
include
labor
unions
,
socialist
movements
,
and
policies
aimed
at
regulating
markets
and
reducing
income
inequality
.



The
concept
of
the
bourgeoisie
is
a
complex
and
multifaceted
one
,
central
to
the
understanding
of
capitalist
societies
.


Its
historical
evolution
,
economic
exploitation
,
class
consciousness
,
role
in
crises
,
global
reach
,
and
the
challenges
it
faces
all
contribute
to
a
rich
analysis
of
this
key
element
of
Marxian
economics
.


This
understanding
serves
as
a
foundation
for
examining
the
dynamics
of
class
struggle
and
the
ongoing
debates
about
economic
and
social
justice
in
contemporary
society
.

Challenges
and
Pitfalls
in
Social
Class
Segmentation[Original
Blog]

1
.


Subjectivity
and
Fluidity
:

-
Social
class
is
not
a
fixed
attribute
;
it
'
s
fluid
and
context-dependent
.


People
can
move
up
or
down
the
social
ladder
due
to
changes
in
income
,
education
,
or
lifestyle
.


For
instance
,
an
entrepreneur
who
experiences
financial
setbacks
might
temporarily
shift
from
an
upper-middle-class
position
to
a
lower
one
.



-
Example
:
Consider
a
freelance
artist
who
earns
a
modest
income
but
identifies
with
the
cultural
tastes
and
preferences
of
the
upper
class
.


Their
social
class
might
be
ambiguous
,
as
it
doesn
'
t
neatly
fit
into
predefined
categories
.



2
.


Multiple
Dimensions
of
Class
:

-
Social
class
isn
'
t
solely
about
income
or
occupation
.


It
encompasses
education
,
cultural
capital
,
and
consumption
patterns
.


Researchers
often
use
a
combination
of
these
factors
to
create
more
nuanced
class
segments
.



-
Example
:
A
highly
educated
professor
might
have
a
lower
income
than
a
successful
business
owner
,
yet
their
cultural
capital
and
social
connections
place
them
in
a
different
class
stratum
.



3
.


Cultural
Bias
and
Stereotypes
:

-
Class
segmentation
can
perpetuate
stereotypes
.


For
instance
,
assuming
that
all
blue-collar
workers
lack
sophistication
or
that
all
wealthy
individuals
are
cultured
.



-
Example
:
Labeling
someone
as
"working
class"
based
on
their
occupation
without
considering
their
interests
,
education
,
or
aspirations
can
lead
to
misclassification
.



4
.


Sampling
Challenges
:

-
Obtaining
representative
samples
for
class
segmentation
surveys
is
difficult
.


People
might
not
accurately
report
their
income
or
social
status
due
to
privacy
concerns
or
social
desirability
bias
.



-
Example
:
A
survey
targeting
high-income
professionals
might
inadvertently
exclude
those
who
prefer
not
to
disclose
their
wealth
.



5
.


Regional
Variation
:

-
Social
class
norms
vary
across
regions
and
cultures
.


What
signifies
affluence
in
one
country
might
not
hold
true
elsewhere
.



-
Example
:
Owning
a
large
suburban
house
with
a
white
picket
fence
might
symbolize
middle-class
stability
in
the
United
States
,
but
it
could
be
irrelevant
in
densely
populated
urban
areas
of
Asia
.



6
.


Intersectionality
:

-
Social
class
intersects
with
other
identity
markers
such
as
race
,
gender
,
and
ethnicity
.


These
intersections
influence
experiences
and
opportunities
.



-
Example
:
A
working-class
woman
of
color
faces
different
challenges
than
a
white
man
from
the
same
economic
background
.


Intersectional
analysis
is
crucial
for
accurate
segmentation
.



7
.


Temporal
Changes
:

-
Social
class
dynamics
evolve
over
time
.


Economic
recessions
,
technological
advancements
,
and
cultural
shifts
impact
class
boundaries
.



-
Example
:
The
rise
of
the
gig
economy
has
blurred
traditional
class
lines
,
with
freelancers
and
contract
workers
challenging
conventional
definitions
.



8
.


Ethical
Considerations
:

-
Segmentation
can
reinforce
inequality
if
used
to
exclude
or
discriminate
.


Ethical
guidelines
are
essential
to

An
Analysis
of
Marxs
Critique[Original
Blog]

Class
struggle
and
capitalism
are
two
concepts
that
have
been
the
subject
of
much
analysis
and
critique
in
the
field
of
Marxism
.


Karl
Marx
,
one
of
the
most
influential
philosophers
and
economists
of
the
19th
century
,
believed
that
capitalism
inevitably
leads
to
class
struggle
and
that
this
struggle
would
ultimately
result
in
the
overthrow
of
the
ruling
class
by
the
working
class
.


This
analysis
has
been
the
foundation
of
Marxist
thought
and
has
been
the
subject
of
much
debate
and
discussion
among
scholars
and
theorists
.



1
.


Marx
believed
that
capitalism
creates
a
class
system
where
the
bourgeoisie
,
or
the
capitalist
class
,
owns
the
means
of
production
and
exploits
the
working
class
,
or
the
proletariat
,
for
their
labor
.


The
working
class
is
paid
wages
that
are
not
equivalent
to
the
value
of
the
goods
and
services
they
produce
,
while
the
bourgeoisie
accumulate
wealth
and
maintain
their
power
through
the
control
of
the
means
of
production
.



2
.


This
class
struggle
,
according
to
Marx
,
is
the
driving
force
behind
historical
change
.


He
believed
that
as
the
working
class
becomes
more
conscious
of
their
exploitation
and
the
injustices
of
the
capitalist
system
,
they
will
eventually
rise
up
and
overthrow
the
ruling
class
.


This
would
lead
to
the
establishment
of
a
socialist
system
,
where
the
means
of
production
are
owned
and
controlled
by
the
workers
themselves
.



3
.


However
,
there
are
criticisms
of
Marx
'
s
analysis
of
class
struggle
and
capitalism
.


Some
argue
that
his
theory
is
too
simplistic
and
fails
to
take
into
account
the
complexities
of
modern
capitalist
societies
.


Others
argue
that
his
theory
is
too
deterministic
and
ignores
the
agency
of
individuals
and
their
ability
to
effect
change
within
the
system
.



4
.


Despite
these
criticisms
,
Marx
'
s
analysis
of
class
struggle
and
capitalism
remains
a
critical
component
of
Marxist
thought
and
has
influenced
the
development
of
socialist
and
communist
movements
around
the
world
.


The
ideas
of
class
consciousness
,
exploitation
,
and
the
struggle
for
economic
and
social
justice
continue
to
be
relevant
and
important
today
.



Overall
,
Marx
'
s
critique
of
capitalism
and
class
struggle
provides
a
unique
perspective
on
the
social
and
economic
forces
that
shape
our
world
.


By
understanding
the
dynamics
of
class
struggle
and
the
exploitative
nature
of
capitalism
,
we
can
better
understand
the
inequalities
and
injustices
that
exist
within
our
society
and
work
towards
creating
a
more
just
and
equitable
world
.

The
Role
of
the
Proletariat
in
the
Marxist
Framework[Original
Blog]

The
idea
of
the
proletariat
being
the
revolutionary
class
is
a
fundamental
tenet
of
Marxism
.


Proletariat
refers
to
the
working
class
,
and
according
to
Marx
'
s
theory
,
they
are
the
ones
who
are
oppressed
by
the
bourgeoisie
,
the
ruling
class
.


The
proletariat
is
central
to
the
Marxist
framework
because
it
is
this
class
that
Marx
believed
would
bring
about
the
revolution
that
would
overthrow
the
capitalist
system
.



From
a
Marxist
perspective
,
the
proletariat
'
s
role
in
the
revolution
is
based
on
the
fact
that
they
are
the
most
exploited
class
in
society
.


They
are
the
ones
who
do
most
of
the
work
but
receive
the
least
amount
of
compensation
.


This
exploitation
is
what
motivates
the
proletarians
to
rise
up
and
demand
a
fairer
system
.


Marx
believed
that
the
proletariat
'
s
revolutionary
potential
comes
from
their
collective
action
,
which
is
why
he
believed
that
the
class
struggle
was
a
crucial
part
of
history
.



To
understand
the
role
of
the
proletariat
in
the
Marxist
framework
,
below
are
some
in-depth
points
that
provide
more
information
on
the
subject
:

1
.


The
Proletariat
is
the
Revolutionary
Class
:
According
to
Marx
,
the
proletariat
is
the
revolutionary
class
because
they
have
nothing
to
lose
but
their
chains
.


They
are
the
ones
who
are
most
vulnerable
to
exploitation
,
and
they
have
the
most
to
gain
from
a
revolution
.


Marx
believed
that
the
proletariat
'
s
revolutionary
potential
came
from
their
collective
action
,
which
is
why
he
believed
that
the
class
struggle
was
a
crucial
part
of
history
.



2
.


Economic
Determinism
:
Marx
believed
that
the
economic
system
was
the
driving
force
behind
history
.


He
argued
that
the
capitalist
system
was
inherently
unstable
and
that
it
would
eventually
collapse
under
its
own
weight
.


Marx
believed
that
the
proletariat
would
be
the
class
that
would
bring
about
this
collapse
,
as
they
would
be
the
ones
who
would
suffer
the
most
from
the
system
'
s
instability
.



3
.


Class
Consciousness
:
Marx
believed
that
the
proletariat
needed
to
become
aware
of
their
exploitation
and
oppression
.


He
believed
that
the
proletariat
'
s
class
consciousness
would
be
the
key
to
their
revolutionary
potential
.


The
more
conscious
the
proletariat
became
of
their
situation
,
the
more
likely
they
were
to
rise
up
and
demand
change
.



4
.


Revolutionary
Action
:
Marx
believed
that
the
proletariat
'
s
revolutionary
potential
would
be
realized
through
their
collective
action
.


He
argued
that
the
proletariat
needed
to
organize
themselves
into
a
political
force
that
could
challenge
the
bourgeoisie
'
s
power
.


Marx
believed
that
the
proletarian
revolution
would
be
a
violent
one
,
and
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
overthrow
the
existing
order
to
create
a
fairer
system
.



The
role
of
the
proletariat
in
the
Marxist
framework
is
central
to
understanding
Marxism
as
a
whole
.


Marx
believed
that
the
proletariat
was
the
revolutionary
class
that
would
bring
about
the
downfall
of
the
capitalist
system
.


The
proletariat
'
s
role
in
the
revolution
is
based
on
their
collective
action
,
economic
determinism
,
class
consciousness
,
and
revolutionary
action
.


The
ultimate
goal
of
the
proletarian
revolution
is
to
create
a
more
equitable
society
that
is
free
from
exploitation
and
oppression
.

The
Role
of
the
Proletariat
in
the
Revolution[Original
Blog]

The
working
class
,
or
the
proletariat
,
plays
a
crucial
role
in
Karl
Marx
'
s
call
for
radical
change
.


According
to
Marx
,
the
proletariat
represents
the
majority
of
the
population
who
are
exploited
by
the
capitalist
class
,
or
the
bourgeoisie
.


The
proletariat
'
s
exploitation
is
a
result
of
the
capitalist
system
,
which
prioritizes
profit
over
the
well-being
of
workers
.


Marx
believed
that
it
is
the
proletariat
'
s
duty
to
overthrow
the
bourgeoisie
and
establish
a
socialist
society
where
the
means
of
production
are
collectively
owned
and
controlled
by
the
working
class
.



From
a
Marxist
perspective
,
the
role
of
the
proletariat
in
the
revolution
can
be
summarized
in
the
following
points
:

1
.


The
proletariat
is
the
revolutionary
class
:
Marx
argued
that
the
proletariat
has
the
potential
to
overthrow
the
capitalist
system
because
they
are
the
most
exploited
and
oppressed
class
.


The
proletariat
'
s
revolutionary
potential
comes
from
their
position
in
the
capitalist
economy
as
wage
laborers
who
have
nothing
to
lose
but
their
chains
.



2
.


The
proletariat
must
organize
:
Marx
believed
that
the
proletariat
must
organize
themselves
into
a
class-conscious
movement
to
achieve
their
revolutionary
goals
.


This
means
that
the
working
class
must
recognize
their
shared
interests
and
unite
to
overthrow
the
capitalist
class
.



3
.


The
proletariat
must
seize
the
means
of
production
:
Once
the
working
class
has
organized
and
gained
class
consciousness
,
they
must
seize
control
of
the
means
of
production
from
the
bourgeoisie
.


This
means
that
factories
,
land
,
and
other
resources
must
be
collectively
owned
and
controlled
by
the
working
class
.



4
.


The
proletariat
must
establish
a
socialist
society
:
Marx
believed
that
the
ultimate
goal
of
the
revolution
is
to
establish
a
socialist
society
where
the
means
of
production
are
owned
and
controlled
by
the
working
class
.


In
a
socialist
society
,
the
well-being
of
all
members
of
society
is
prioritized
over
profit
.



One
example
of
the
proletariat
'
s
revolutionary
potential
can
be
seen
in
the
Russian
Revolution
of
1917
.


The
Bolsheviks
,
a
socialist
party
led
by
Vladimir
Lenin
,
gained
support
from
the
working
class
and
successfully
overthrew
the
capitalist
government
.


The
Bolsheviks
established
a
socialist
government
and
implemented
policies
that
prioritized
the
well-being
of
workers
,
such
as
a
minimum
wage
and
eight-hour
workday
.



The
proletariat
plays
a
central
role
in
Karl
Marx
'
s
call
for
radical
change
.


The
working
class
'
s
revolutionary
potential
comes
from
their
position
in
the
capitalist
economy
as
the
most
exploited
and
oppressed
class
.


The
proletariat
must
organize
,
seize
the
means
of
production
,
and
establish
a
socialist
society
to
achieve
their
revolutionary
goals
.


The
Russian
Revolution
of
1917
serves
as
an
example
of
the
proletariat
'
s
revolutionary
potential
and
the
successful
establishment
of
a
socialist
government
.

Engels
Definition
and
Characteristics
of
the
Proletariat[Original
Blog]

The
concept
of
the
proletariat
is
one
of
the
most
essential
elements
of
Marxist
theory
.


Friedrich
Engels
,
who
co-authored
The
Communist
Manifesto
with
Karl
Marx
,
provided
a
definition
and
characteristics
of
the
proletariat
in
his
work
,
The
Condition
of
the
Working
Class
in
England
.


Engels
considered
the
proletariat
as
a
social
class
consisting
of
individuals
who
sell
their
labor
power
to
capitalists
in
exchange
for
wages
.


He
believed
that
the
proletariat
'
s
position
in
society
is
one
of
exploitation
,
with
capitalists
using
their
labor
to
generate
profits
.



Engels
'

definition
of
the
proletariat
also
included
specific
characteristics
that
he
believed
identified
them
as
a
distinct
social
class
.


These
characteristics
include
:

1
.


Lack
of
control
over
the
means
of
production
:
Engels
argued
that
the
proletariat
had
no
ownership
or
control
over
the
tools
,
machinery
,
and
resources
they
used
to
produce
goods
and
services
.


This
lack
of
control
made
them
dependent
on
capitalists
for
employment
and
wages
.



2
.


Proletarianization
:
Engels
believed
that
the
process
of
industrialization
transformed
peasants
,
artisans
,
and
small
business
owners
into
the
proletariat
.


This
process
involved
the
displacement
of
workers
from
their
traditional
means
of
livelihood
and
forcing
them
to
sell
their
labor
to
capitalists
.



3
.


Consciousness
of
their
class
position
:
Engels
argued
that
the
proletariat
was
becoming
increasingly
aware
of
their
class
position
and
their
exploitation
by
capitalists
.


This
awareness
would
eventually
lead
to
class
consciousness
,
where
workers
would
unite
and
seize
control
of
the
means
of
production
.



4
.


Internationalism
:
Engels
believed
that
the
proletariat
was
a
global
class
,
with
workers
in
different
countries
sharing
a
common
interest
in
overthrowing
capitalism
.


This
internationalism
would
lead
to
the
formation
of
a
global
workers
'

revolution
.



Overall
,
Engels
'

definition
and
characteristics
of
the
proletariat
highlight
the
exploitation
and
struggle
of
the
working
class
under
capitalism
.


These
ideas
have
been
influential
in
Marxist
theory
and
have
shaped
the
understanding
of
social
class
and
class
struggle
.


For
example
,
the
labor
strikes
and
protests
organized
by
workers
in
the
late
19th
and
early
20th
centuries
were
aimed
at
improving
their
working
conditions
and
wages
,
which
were
often
inadequate
under
capitalist
systems
.

Economic
Determinism
and
Social
Change[Original
Blog]

economic
determinism
is
a
key
concept
in
Marxian
economic
thought
that
explores
the
relationship
between
the
economy
and
social
change
.


According
to
this
perspective
,
the
economic
structure
of
society
is
the
primary
driver
of
social
development
,
shaping
the
beliefs
,
values
,
and
institutions
that
exist
within
a
given
society
.


This
concept
,
rooted
in
historical
materialism
,
provides
a
framework
for
understanding
how
economic
factors
influence
the
course
of
history
and
shape
the
dynamics
of
social
transformation
.



From
a
Marxian
perspective
,
economic
determinism
argues
that
the
mode
of
production
,
or
the
way
in
which
goods
are
produced
and
distributed
,
forms
the
foundation
of
social
life
.


The
economic
structure
of
society
,
comprising
the
relations
of
production
and
the
forces
of
production
,
determines
the
social
relations
and
hierarchies
that
exist
within
it
.


This
means
that
the
dominant
economic
class
,
which
controls
the
means
of
production
,
also
wields
significant
power
and
influence
over
the
political
,
cultural
,
and
ideological
aspects
of
society
.



1
.


Economic
Determinism
and
Class
Struggle
:
One
of
the
central
tenets
of
economic
determinism
is
the
idea
that
social
change
is
driven
by
class
struggle
.


Marx
argued
that
throughout
history
,
societies
have
been
characterized
by
a
series
of
class
antagonisms
,
pitting
the
ruling
class
against
the
working
class
.


These
conflicts
arise
due
to
the
inherent
contradictions
within
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
,
where
the
pursuit
of
profit
by
the
bourgeoisie
leads
to
the
exploitation
of
the
proletariat
.


As
the
working
class
becomes
increasingly
aware
of
their
exploitation
,
they
engage
in
collective
action
and
struggle
against
the
ruling
class
,
ultimately
leading
to
social
change
.



2
.


Economic
Determinism
and
Technological
Advancement
:
Another
aspect
of
economic
determinism
is
the
role
of
technological
advancement
in
shaping
social
change
.


Marx
believed
that
technological
progress
,
driven
by
the
need
for
increased
efficiency
and
productivity
,
creates
the
conditions
for
social
transformation
.


For
example
,
the
Industrial
Revolution
in
the
18th
and
19th
centuries
brought
about
significant
changes
in
the
economic
structure
of
society
,
leading
to
the
rise
of
capitalism
and
the
emergence
of
a
new
working
class
.


Technological
advancements
such
as
the
steam
engine
and
mechanized
production
methods
fundamentally
altered
the
mode
of
production
,
resulting
in
profound
social
and
economic
changes
.



3
.


Economic
Determinism
and
Ideology
:
Economic
determinism
also
emphasizes
the
influence
of
ideology
in
maintaining
and
reproducing
the
existing
economic
structure
.


Marx
argued
that
the
ruling
class
,
through
their
control
of
key
institutions
such
as
the
media
,
education
,
and
the
state
,
propagates
a
dominant
ideology
that
justifies
and
legitimizes
the
existing
social
order
.


This
ideology
,
often
referred
to
as
false
consciousness
,
serves
to
maintain
the
status
quo
and
prevent
the
working
class
from
recognizing
their
exploitation
and
engaging
in
collective
action
.


However
,
Marx
believed
that
through
class
struggle
and
the
development
of
class
consciousness
,
the
working
class
can
overcome
this
false
consciousness
and
challenge
the
dominant
ideology
,
paving
the
way
for
social
change
.



In
summary
,
economic
determinism
is
a
fundamental
concept
in
Marxian
economic
thought
that
highlights
the

The
Proletariat
in
Marxian
Economic
Thought[Original
Blog]

Economic
Thought

In
the
intricate
tapestry
of
Marxian
economic
thought
,
the
concept
of
the
proletariat
stands
as
a
cornerstone
,
representing
a
pivotal
force
that
propels
the
dynamics
of
capitalism
.


The
term
"proletariat"
refers
to
the
working
class
,
individuals
who
,
in
Marxist
terms
,
do
not
own
the
means
of
production
but
sell
their
labor
power
for
wages
.


This
section
delves
into
the
nuanced
dimensions
of
the
proletariat
within
Marxian
economic
analysis
,
examining
the
role
,
challenges
,
and
implications
associated
with
this
critical
social
class
.



Marx
viewed
the
proletariat
as
a
revolutionary
forcea
class
with
nothing
to
lose
but
its
chains
.


From
his
perspective
,
the
inherent
contradictions
within
capitalism
would
propel
the
proletariat
towards
a
historical
mission
:
to
overthrow
the
bourgeoisie
and
establish
a
classless
society
.


Critics
argue
that
this
perspective
oversimplifies
the
dynamics
of
social
change
,
emphasizing
class
struggle
as
the
primary
driver
of
historical
progression
.


However
,
proponents
of
Marxian
thought
assert
that
the
proletariat
'
s
central
position
in
production
endows
them
with
the
potential
to
disrupt
the
capitalist
system
from
within
.



1
.


Exploitation
and
Alienation
:

-
The
proletariat
,
according
to
Marx
,
experiences
exploitation
and
alienation
within
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
.


Their
labor
,
a
commodity
,
is
subjected
to
the
whims
of
the
market
,
resulting
in
surplus
value
appropriated
by
the
bourgeoisie
.


This
process
not
only
leads
to
economic
disparity
but
also
generates
a
sense
of
alienation
as
workers
become
detached
from
the
products
of
their
labor
.



2
.


Class
Consciousness
:

-
Marx
envisioned
the
proletariat
developing
class
consciousnessa
realization
of
their
shared
exploitation
and
collective
interests
.


Achieving
class
consciousness
was
deemed
crucial
for
the
proletariat
to
unite
and
undertake
revolutionary
action
.


Historical
examples
,
such
as
labor
movements
and
strikes
,
serve
as
manifestations
of
this
collective
awareness
among
the
working
class
.

.


Global
Proletariat
and
Imperialism
:

-
As
capitalism
expanded
globally
,
so
did
the
concept
of
the
proletariat
.


The
interconnection
of
workers
across
borders
became
evident
,
challenging
traditional
notions
of
a
localized
working
class
.


Imperialism
,
as
an
advanced
stage
of
capitalism
,
accentuates
global
economic
inequalities
,
with
the
proletariat
facing
distinct
challenges
in
different
regions
.

.


Technological
Advancements
and
the
Proletariat
:

-
The
impact
of
technological
advancements
on
the
proletariat
is
a
topic
of
contemporary
relevance
.


automation
and
artificial
intelligence
pose
challenges
to
traditional
labor
roles
,
reshaping
the
landscape
of
the
working
class
.


While
some
argue
that
technology
may
liberate
the
proletariat
from
menial
tasks
,
others
express
concerns
about
job
displacement
and
heightened
economic
inequality
.



5
.


Proletariat
in
Non-Industrialized
Settings
:

-
Marx
'
s
analysis
primarily
focused
on
industrialized
societies
,
and
critics
contend
that
his
framework
might
not
fully
capture
the
experiences
of
the
working
class
in
non-industrialized
settings
.


Exploring
how
the
concept
adapts
to
different
economic
structures
provides
a
comprehensive
understanding
of
the
proletariat
'
s
role
in
diverse
contexts
.



In
navigating
the
labyrinth
of
Marxian
economic
thought
,
the
proletariat
emerges
as
a
dynamic
force
,
subject
to
historical
shifts
and
contextual
intricacies
.


By
critically
examining
its
role
within
capitalism
,
one
can
unravel
the
multifaceted
layers
that
characterize
the
relationship
between
the
working
class
and
the
broader
socio-economic
landscape
.

Collective
Action
and
the
Path
to
Empowerment[Original
Blog]

Collective
action

In
the
realm
of
Marxian
economics
and
the
pursuit
of
empowering
the
proletariat
,
the
concept
of
collective
action
emerges
as
a
potent
force
for
change
.


It
represents
a
key
mechanism
through
which
individuals
,
often
marginalized
and
disempowered
,
can
unify
their
efforts
to
challenge
established
power
structures
and
advocate
for
their
rights
and
interests
.


At
its
core
,
collective
action
embodies
the
idea
that
when
people
join
together
to
pursue
common
goals
,
they
become
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with
.


This
section
explores
the
significance
of
collective
action
from
various
perspectives
,
shedding
light
on
how
it
can
be
a
transformative
tool
for
achieving
empowerment
in
a
capitalist
society
.



1
.


Solidarity
in
Numbers
:

Collective
action
hinges
on
the
belief
that
there
is
strength
in
numbers
.


The
more
individuals
unite
to
address
shared
concerns
,
the
greater
their
collective
power
becomes
.


An
illustrative
example
of
this
is
labor
unions
.


These
organizations
bring
workers
together
to
negotiate
for
better
wages
,
working
conditions
,
and
benefits
.


When
an
individual
employee
attempts
to
negotiate
with
a
large
corporation
,
the
power
dynamics
are
overwhelmingly
skewed
.


However
,
when
all
workers
in
a
particular
sector
unite
,
they
create
a
formidable
force
that
can
compel
employers
to
listen
and
make
concessions
.



2
.


Awareness
and
Consciousness
:

Collective
action
often
involves
raising
awareness
about
the
issues
at
hand
.


It
encourages
individuals
to
develop
class
consciousness
,
a
foundational
concept
in
Marxian
economics
.


As
people
come
together
to
discuss
their
shared
struggles
and
experiences
,
they
become
more
conscious
of
the
structural
inequalities
in
society
.


This
heightened
awareness
can
galvanize
them
to
take
action
,
whether
through
protests
,
strikes
,
or
other
forms
of
collective
resistance
.



3
.


The
Role
of
Trade
Unions
:

Trade
unions
exemplify
the
power
of
collective
action
within
the
context
of
labor
.


They
act
as
intermediaries
between
workers
and
employers
,
advocating
for
better
wages
,
working
conditions
,
and
job
security
.


By
pooling
resources
and
leveraging
collective
bargaining
,
unions
empower
workers
to
challenge
the
status
quo
.


Consider
the
history
of
labor
movements
in
the
United
States
,
where
unions
played
a
pivotal
role
in
securing
workers
'

rights
and
influencing
labor
laws
.



4
.


Political
Mobilization
:

Beyond
economic
aspects
,
collective
action
can
also
translate
into
political
influence
.


When
individuals
come
together
with
shared
concerns
,
they
can
influence
public
policy
and
advocate
for
legislative
changes
that
benefit
the
working
class
.


Grassroots
movements
,
like
the
civil
Rights
movement
in
the
United
States
or
the
anti-apartheid
movement
in
South
Africa
,
demonstrated
the
transformative
power
of
collective
action
in
shaping
political
landscapes
.



5
.


Challenges
and
Counterarguments
:

It
is
important
to
acknowledge
that
collective
action
is
not
without
its
challenges
.


Some
argue
that
it
can
lead
to
groupthink
or
the
suppression
of
individual
voices
.


Critics
also
question
the
efficacy
of
collective
action
in
achieving
lasting
change
.


To
address
these
concerns
,
it
'
s
vital
to
strike
a
balance
between
collective
efforts
and
the
preservation
of
individual
agency
within
the
group
.



6
.


Digital
Era
Empowerment
:

In
the
digital
age
,
collective
action
has
found
new
avenues
for
expression
and
empowerment
.


social
media
platforms
have
become
catalysts
for
organizing
protests
,
spreading
awareness
,
and
amplifying
the
voices
of
marginalized
groups
.


Movements
like
#BlackLivesMatter
and
#MeToo
have
harnessed
the
power
of
online
collective
action
to
shed
light
on
injustices
and
demand
change
.



Collective
action
,
deeply
rooted
in
the
principles
of
solidarity
and
unity
,
stands
as
a
linchpin
in
the
quest
to
empower
the
proletariat
within
Marxian
economics
.


It
empowers
individuals
to
transcend
their
isolated
struggles
,
fosters
class
consciousness
,
and
amplifies
their
influence
in
economic
,
political
,
and
social
spheres
.


While
not
without
its
challenges
,
the
potential
for
transformative
change
through
collective
action
remains
a
powerful
force
in
shaping
a
more
equitable
and
just
society
.

The
Impact
of
Wage
Labor
on
Society[Original
Blog]

Impact
of
the
wage

Wage
Labor

Wage
labor
has
been
a
crucial
component
of
the
labor
theory
of
value
and
has
greatly
impacted
society
as
a
whole
.


Some
view
wage
labor
as
a
necessary
aspect
of
modern
capitalism
,
while
others
argue
that
it
is
exploitative
and
perpetuates
economic
inequality
.


Regardless
of
one
'
s
perspective
,
it
is
clear
that
wage
labor
has
had
far-reaching
effects
on
various
aspects
of
society
,
including
the
economy
,
politics
,
and
social
relations
.



1
.


Economic
Impact
:
Wage
labor
has
played
a
significant
role
in
shaping
the
modern
economy
.


It
has
allowed
for
the
production
of
goods
and
services
on
a
large
scale
,
leading
to
increased
efficiency
and
productivity
.


However
,
wage
labor
can
also
contribute
to
economic
inequality
,
as
low-wage
workers
often
struggle
to
make
ends
meet
,
while
those
at
the
top
of
the
income
ladder
reap
the
benefits
of
their
labor
.


This
has
led
to
debates
about
the
minimum
wage
,
living
wage
,
and
the
need
for
greater
income
redistribution
.



2
.


Political
Impact
:
The
rise
of
wage
labor
has
also
had
important
political
implications
.


It
has
led
to
the
emergence
of
labor
unions
and
other
worker
advocacy
groups
,
which
have
fought
for
better
working
conditions
,
higher
wages
,
and
greater
workers
'

rights
.


However
,
wage
labor
has
also
been
used
as
a
tool
for
political
control
,
as
employers
can
use
the
threat
of
unemployment
to
keep
workers
in
line
and
prevent
them
from
organizing
.



3
.


Social
Impact
:
Wage
labor
has
also
had
a
profound
impact
on
social
relations
.


It
has
created
a
division
between
those
who
own
the
means
of
production
and
those
who
sell
their
labor
.


This
has
led
to
the
development
of
class
consciousness
,
as
workers
come
to
realize
their
shared
interests
and
common
struggles
.


At
the
same
time
,
wage
labor
can
also
create
social
divisions
within
the
working
class
,
as
workers
compete
with
one
another
for
jobs
and
wages
.



Overall
,
the
impact
of
wage
labor
on
society
is
complex
and
multifaceted
.


While
it
has
undoubtedly
played
a
crucial
role
in
the
development
of
modern
capitalism
,
it
has
also
led
to
economic
inequality
,
political
control
,
and
social
divisions
.


As
we
continue
to
grapple
with
these
issues
,
it
is
important
to
consider
the
broader
implications
of
wage
labor
and
to
work
towards
a
more
just
and
equitable
society
.

Freedom
of
conscience
is
one
of
the
fundamental
freedoms
protected
by
section
2
of
the Canadian
Charter
of
Rights
and
Freedoms
.

[1]

What
is
the
legal
impact
of
this
freedom
?



Ultimately
,
the
freedom
of
conscience
constitutionally
recognizes
“the
centrality
of
individual
conscience
and
the
inappropriateness
of
governmental
intervention
…
to
constrain
its
manifestation
.

”[2] In
fact
,
the
Supreme
Court
has
ruled
that
“an
emphasis
on
individual
conscience
and
individual
judgment
…
lies
at
the
heart
of
our
democratic
political
tradition
.


The
ability
of
each
citizen
to
make
free
and
informed
decisions
is
the
absolute
prerequisite
for
the
legitimacy
,
acceptability
,
and
efficacy
of
our
system
of
self‑government
.

”[3]

What
is
legally
protected
from
government
interference
?



The
only
Supreme
Court
case
considering
the
freedom
of
conscience
directly
is R
v
Morgentaler
.

[4]
This
1988
case
dealt
with
the
constitutionality
of
abortion
laws
.


Justice
Wilson
stated
:
“[t]he
decision
whether
or
not
to
terminate
a
pregnancy
is
essentially
a
moral
decision
and
…
the
conscience
of
the
individual
must
be
paramount
.

”[5] She
also
held
that
the
freedoms
guaranteed
by
section
2(a)
“should
be
broadly
construed
to
extend
to
conscientiously-held
beliefs
whether
grounded
in
religion
or
in
a
secular
morality
.

”[6] However
,
since
Justice
Wilson
opposed
the
majority
decision
of
the
Court
,
her
judgment
is
not
considered
a
settled
statement
of
the
law
.



Without
guidance
from
the
Supreme
Court
,
lower
courts
have
had
to
figure
out
on
their
own
what
the
freedom
of
conscience
protects
.


From
the
limited
jurisprudence
that
exists
,
we
know
“[t]he
guarantee
of
freedom
of
conscience
…
is
directed
at
an
individual
'
s
overarching
…
normative
value
system
.

”[7] If
a
person’s
actions
are
not
motivated
by
a
“comprehensive
value
system”
(in
a
secular
context)
,
 then
they
are
not
protected
by
section
2(a)
.

[8] This
can
be
quite
limiting
:
when
people
have
argued
that
their
freedom
of
conscience
was
violated
by
mandatory
seatbelt
laws
for
example
,
their
arguments
failed
because
their
objections
were
not
supported
by
a
comprehensive
value
system
.



‘Insubstantial’
infringements
upon
a
person’s
conscience
are
also
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
guarantee
.

[9] This
is
a
limitation
that
all
the
fundamental
freedoms
share
:
the freedom
of
religion for
instance
does
not
extend
to
protect
against
‘trivial’
infringements
upon
a
person’s
religious
practice
.

[10]

One
of
the
few
lower
court
decisions
solely
considering
the
freedom
of
conscience
,
rather
than
conscience
and
religion
together
,
was Maurice
v
Canada
(Attorney
General)
.

[11]
Mr
.


Maurice
wanted
to
receive
vegetarian
meals
in
prison
.


Originally
,
he
was
provided
with
these
meals
in
recognition
of
his freedom
of
religion
.


However
,
when
he
renounced
his
religious
beliefs
,
the
prison
stopped
providing
vegetarian
meals
.


He
successfully
claimed
that
,
since
he
remained
vegetarian
for
conscientious
reasons
,
this
was
a
violation
of
his
freedom
of
conscience
.

[12] The
Federal
Court
agreed
,
declaring
that
the
“Charter …
entitle[s]
the
Applicant
to
a
vegetarian
diet
.

”[13]

The
freedom
of
conscience
garnered
some
attention
in
2015
when
the
Supreme
Court
decided Carter
v
Canada
(Attorney
General)
.


In
that
case
,
a
number
of
interveners
claimed
that
providing
access
to
physician-assisted
dying
would
infringe
the
freedom
of
conscience
of
medical
professionals
.

[14] This
argument
went
beyond
the
scope
of
what
needed
to
be
decided
in
that
case
.


However
the
Court
noted
that
physician-assisted
dying
was
indeed
a
“matter
of
conscience”
and
that
at
some
point
“the Charter
rights
of
patients
and
physicians
will
need
to
be
reconciled
.

”[15]

What
are
the
limitations
on
the
freedom
of
conscience
?



While
the
freedom
of
conscience
is
a
fundamental
freedom
,
it
is
not
absolute
.


As
with
all
other
rights
and
freedoms
in
the Charter
,
if
a
breach
of
this
freedom
is
found
by
a
court
,
the
government
can
argue
that
its
laws
are
reasonable
and
justifiable
under section
1 of
the Charter
.

What
is

of
Conscience
in

?

The
Modern
Misunderstanding
of
Conscience

The
Catholic
Church
teaches
that
the
conscience
is
a
natural
facility
of
our
reason
that
directs
us
to
do
good
and
avoid
evil
;
that
makes
judgments
about
the
good
and
evil
of
particular
acts
;
and
that
bears
witness
after
the
fact
to
the
good
or
evil
that
we
have
done
,
such
as
what
we
call
“having
a
guilty
conscience
.

”¹

A
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
the
role
of
the
human
conscience
lies
at
the
root
of
many
of
the
problems
in
the
Catholic
Church
today
.


Very
few
Catholics
even
know
what
that
role
actually
is
.


When
pressed
,
many
will
say
something
along
the
lines
of
“If
my
conscience
tells
me
that
a
particular
action
is
all
right
,
I
can
do
it
.

”

This
is
just
another
way
of
saying
“If
it
feels
good
,
do
it
.

”
If
an
improperly-formed
conscience
leads
a
person
to
accept
something
as
right
and
good
based
simply
on
his
or
her
uninformed
opinions
and
feelings
,
that
person
will
fall
into
grave
errors
for
which
there
is
no
good
excuse
before
God
:


When
Gentiles
who
have
not
the
law
do
by
nature
what
the
law
requires
,

they
are
a
law
to
themselves
,
even
though
they
do
not
have
the
law
.



They
show
that
what
the
law
requires
is
written
on
their
hearts
,
while

their
conscience
also
bears
witness
and
their
conflicting
thoughts

accuse
or
perhaps
excuse
them
on
that
day
when
,
according
to
my

gospel
,
God
judges
the
secrets
of
men
by
Christ
Jesus
.


(Romans

2
:14-15)

Many
Catholics
erroneously
believe
that
the
conscience
is
a
teacher
,
not
a
pupil
;
that
it
is
the
source
of
morality
.


This
is
not
the
teaching
of
the
Catholic
Church
.


According
to
the
Church
,
the
conscience
is
a
witness
to
the
moral
law
authored
by
God
.


Each
Catholic
is
required
to
obey
that
moral
law
in
all
things
.


The
conscience
,
if
properly
formed
,
calls
him
to
obey
that
moral
law
and
helps
him
to
understand
how
to
apply
it
in
particular
cases
.



This
is
why
the
cultivation
of
the
cardinal
virtue
of
prudence
is
essential
.


As
the
Catechism
teaches
,
“Man
strives
to
interpret
the
data
of
experience
and
the
signs
of
the
times
assisted
by
the
virtue
of
prudence
,
by
the
advice
of
competent
people
,
and
by
the
help
of
the
Holy
Spirit
and
his
gifts”
(¶1788)
.

Result
:
A
Deformed
Belief
System

The
belief
that
the
conscience
is
a
moral
authority
in
its
own
right
has
resulted
in
Catholics
supporting
and
promoting
many
intrinsic
evils
,
including
contraception
,
sterilization
,
abortion
,
homosexual
activity
,
pornography
and
euthanasia
.



Many
organizations
vigorously
promote
this
false
understanding
of
the
human
conscience
in
order
to
gain
more
support
from
Catholic
laity
.


One
of
these
groups
is
“Catholics”
for
Choice
(CFC)
,
whose
mission
consists
of
attempting
to
convince
people
that
they
can
be
pro-abortion
and
still
be
“good
Catholics
.

”
In
its
quarterly
magazine
,
ironically
entitled
Conscience
,
CFC
attempts
to
legitimize
the
obvious
paradox
that
“Church
law
affirms
both
the
right
and
the
responsibility
of
a
Catholic
to
follow
his
or
her
conscience
,
even
when
it
conflicts
with
church
teaching”²
(emphasis
added)
.



CFC
also
alleges
:


The
Catholic
Church
officially
teaches
that
the
conscience
of
an

individual
is
supreme
.


If
you
carefully
examine
your
conscience
and

then
decide
that
an
abortion
is
the
most
moral
act
you
can
do
at
this

time
,
you
are
not
committing
a
sin
.


Therefore
,
you
are
not

excommunicated
.


Nor
need
you
tell
it
in
confession
,
since
,
in
your

case
,
abortion
is
not
a
sin
.

³

It
is
easy
to
demonstrate
that
CFC
does
not
really
believe
this
principle
itself
.


For
example
,
would
it
concede
that
it
was
legitimate
for
someone
to
“carefully
examine
their
conscience”
and
then
decide
that
torching
an
abortion
clinic
in
the
middle
of
the
night
was
“the
most
moral
act
they
could
do
at
this
time
?

”

Obviously
not
.



This
is
a
fundamental
error
,
and
are
many
examples
of
how
it
naturally
carries
over
into
other
moral
issues
.


Teresa
Kelly
,
a
member
of
Toronto’s
Catholic
school
board
,
recently
said
that
being
part
of
a
gay-straight
alliance
whose
purpose
is
to
disseminate
homophile
propaganda
in
the
schools
is
“the
embodiment
of
a
perfectly-formed
Catholic
conscience
.

”
She
dismissed
her
critics
,
who
quoted
actual
Church
teachings
on
homosexuality
,
as
“archaic
.

Personal
Judgement
vs
.


Objective
Standards

How
does
conscience
relate
to
morality
?



In
order
for
a
person’s
conscience
to
be
conditioned
to
accept
evil
,
it
must
first
decisively
turn
away
from
God’s
teachings
and
decide
that
it
can
determine
for
itself
what
is
right
and
wrong
,
ignoring
all
external
and
objective
standards
if
necessary
in
order
to
reach
the
desired
conclusion
.



This
means
that
dissenters
must
justify
their
claims
by
assuming
that
there
is
no
fixed
morality
that
is
binding
on
all
persons
.


The
only
source
of
morality
is
the
conscience
of
each
individual
.


One
phrase
that
is
coming
into
common
usage
among
the
self-appointed
elite
is
“This
is
my
truth
.

”

However
,
the
intrinsic
flaw
with
that
understanding
is
the
fact
that
every
human
being
is
naturally
attuned
to
their
own
subjective
view
of
the
world
.


This
subjective
view
exists
in
order
to
promote
the
highest
good
of
the
individual
.


However
,
if
that
view
is
not
held
to
an
objective
standard
,
it
is
easy
for
the
individual
to
consider
not
what
is
morally
good
(i
.

e
.


,
virtuous)
but
rather
what
is
personally
good
(i
.

e
.


,
convenient)
.



This
type
of
thinking
leads
many
to
justify
actions
that
no
moral
law
would
permit
.



[natural
law
gives
moral
principles
to
conscience
,
which
then
makes
decisions][natural
law
gives
moral
principles
to
conscience
,
which
then

Catholics
and
Church
Teaching

It
is
one
thing
for
a
person
to
say
“I
disagree
with
the
Church’s
teaching
on
abortion
.

”
It
is
another
thing
entirely
to
say
“The
Church
teaches
that
abortion
is
permissible
,
so
long
as
my
conscience
allows
it
.

”
This
statement
is
false
,
and
can
only
be
uttered
by
one
who
is
grossly
ignorant
of
Church
teaching
or
who
deliberately
lies
about
such
teaching
.



Ignorance
is
certainly
no
excuse
for
committing
sin
because
every
Catholic
has
the
duty
to
know
what
is
evil
and
what
is
not
,
and
,
further
,
they
should
know
why
certain
activities
are
evil
.


Secular
courts
enforce
the
general
rule
that
“ignorance
of
the
law
is
no
excuse
,”
and
everyone
accepts
this
principle
;
why
should
it
be
any
different
for
the
eternal
law
?



A
person
is
culpable
for
the
evil
he
commits
when
he
“takes
little
trouble
to
find
out
what
is
true
and
good
,
or
when
conscience
is
by
degrees
almost
blinded
through
the
habit
of
committing
sin
.

The
Formation
of
the
Conscience

The
conscience
is
a
precious
gift
and
it
must
be
cared
for
by
forming
it
with
prayer
and
education
for
the
duration
of
our
lives
.



The
Catechism
states
,
“The
education
of
conscience
is
indispensable
for
human
beings
who
are
subjected
to
negative
influences
and
tempted
by
sin
to
prefer
their
own
judgment
and
to
reject
authoritative
teachings”
(¶1783)
.



A
dead
giveaway
that
a
person’s
conscience
is
improperly
formed
is
when
he
or
she
says
something
like
“I
respect
the
teachings
of
the
Church
,
but
I
follow
my
own
conscience
in
matters
of
sexual
morality
.

”
Nancy
Pelosi
gave
us
a
typical
example
of
this
deception
when
she
claimed
that
she
was
a
“practicing
and
respectful
Catholic”
but
,
regarding
the
Church’s
teachings
on
abortion
,
“My
faith
isn’t
about
what
their
position
is
.

”⁶

This
means
that
the
person’s
conscience
has
become
disconnected
from
the
truth
.


This
has
several
root
causes
(Catechism
,
¶1792)
:

-
“Ignorance
of
Christ
and
His
Gospel
,
-
Bad
example
given
by
others
,
-
Enslavement
to
one’s
passions
,
-
Assertion
of
a
mistaken
notion
of
autonomy
of
conscience
,
-
Rejection
of
the
Church’s
authority
and
her
teaching
,
-
Lack
of
conversion
and
of
charity
.

”

By
contrast
,
a
properly‑formed
Catholic
conscience
has
been
rigorously
educated
,
is
fully
aware
of
the
intrinsically
evil
nature
of
abortion
and
other
evils
,
and
is
led
by
this
knowledge
to
vigorously
oppose
them
.



Failure
to
act
is
not
a
viable
option
.



It
is
true
that
Catholics
must
follow
their
consciences
,
but
their
consciences
must
be
formed
by
the
Word
of
God
,
which
is
authentically
interpreted
and
taught
by
the
Magisterium
of
the
Catholic
Church
,
to
which
Christ
entrusted
His
authority
to
teach
in
His
Name
.


The
conscience
must
be
continuously
schooled
to
recognize
,
not
to
determine
,
what
is
and
is
not
moral
activity
.



As
the
Catechism
teaches
,
“Objective
rules
of
morality
express
the
rational
order
of
good
and
evil
,
attested
to
by
conscience
.

…
It
is
by
the
judgment
of
conscience
that
man
perceives
and
recognizes
the
prescriptions
of
the
divine
law”
(¶1751
,
1778)
.

Conscience
and
Vatican
II

Some
appeal
to
an
ill‑defined
“Spirit
of
Vatican
II”
to
support
their
concept
of
the
human
conscience
.


They
use
vague
terms
such
as
“renewal
,”
“reinvigoration”
and
“rejuvenation”
of
the
Church
,
while
consciously
misrepresenting
what
the
documents
of
the
Council
actually
say
.


They
often
quote
the
Vatican
II
document
Dignitatis
Humanae
(“Declaration
on
Religious
Freedom”)
in
support
of
their
contention
that
people
should
be
able
to
do
anything
their
uneducated
consciences
do
not
object
to
.

⁷

However
,
this
is
obviously
not
what
the
Fathers
of
Vatican
II
taught
.


They
instead
laid
out
very
clearly
the
multiple
dangers
inherent
in
this
line
of
thinking
.


In
Gaudium
et
Spes
,
they
wrote
,
“Conscience
frequently
errs
from
invincible
ignorance
without
losing
its
dignity
.


The
same
cannot
be
said
for
a
man
who
cares
but
little
for
truth
and
goodness
,
or
for
a
conscience
which
by
degrees
grows
practically
sightless
as
a
result
of
habitual
sin”
(¶16‑17)
.


Furthermore
,
the
document
notes
that
“not
a
few
can
be
found
who
seem
inclined
to
use
the
name
of
freedom
as
the
pretext
for
refusing
to
submit
to
authority
and
for
making
light
of
the
duty
of
obedience
.

”⁸

The
document
continues
by
confirming
an
essential
principle
:
That
the
conscience
must
submit
itself
to
the
authority
of
the
Church
:


In
forming
their
consciences
,
the
Christian
faithful
must
give
careful

attention
to
the
sacred
and
certain
teaching
of
the
Church
.


For
the

Catholic
Church
is
by
the
will
of
Christ
the
teacher
of
truth
.


Her

charge
is
to
announce
and
teach
authentically
that
truth
which
is

Christ
,
and
at
the
same
time
with
her
authority
to
declare
and
confirm

the
principles
of
the
moral
order
which
derive
from
human
nature

itself
.


(¶14)

Conscience
does
have
a
very
particular
and
necessary
role
given
by
God
.


As
defined
in
Romans
2
:12‑16
and
Jeremiah
31
:33
,
God
imprints
the
natural
law
on
the
heart
and
soul
of
man
,
and
this
leads
him
to
know
whether
or
not
an
act
is
moral
or
evil
.

⁹
This
means
that
the
“natural
law”
is
man’s
instinctual
knowledge
of
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
―
his
“conscience
.

”
However
,
the
conscience
must
work
with
the
teachings
of
the
Church
,
never
against
it
.



 

Conscientious
Objection

The
Church
,
as
demonstrated
in
a
particularly
vivid
manner
by
Her
martyrs
,
has
always
held
that
a
person’s
properly-formed
conscience
may
never
be
violated
.


Countless
men
,
women
and
even
children
have
courageously
stated
,
“You
may
kill
me
,
but
you
will
never
force
me
to
violate
my
conscience
.

”

This
principle
has
more
recently
been
recognized
by
secular
authorities
.


The
United
Nations
,
in
both
its
1948
Universal
Declaration
of
Human
Rights
and
its
1966
International
Covenant
on
Civil
and
Political
Rights
,
states
that
“everyone
has
the
right
to
freedom
of
thought
,
conscience
and
religion
.

”

When
society
fails
to
acknowledge
conscience
as
a
human
right
and
does
not
provide
protections
for
individuals
to
follow
their
own
consciences
,
grave
conflicts
inevitably
result
.


Either
people
will
heroically
obey
their
consciences
whatever
the
cost
,
or
they
will
lose
their
moral
integrity
with
all
the
devastating
effects
that
flow
from
this
on
society
at
large
.



There
are
thousands
of
incidents
on
record
where
conscientious
objectors
are
severely
punished
,
particularly
in
the
health
care
profession
.


Many
have
been
fined
,
dismissed
from
their
jobs
,
and
even
in
some
cases
jailed
for
refusing
to
participate
in
such
intrinsic
evils
such
as
dispensing
contraceptives
and
abortifacients
and
refusing
to
participate
in
such
fundamental
violations
of
human
dignity
as
abortion
,
euthanasia
,
and
so-called
“sex-changed”
surgeries
.



 

Conclusion

Tragically
,
many
Catholics
possess
a
fatally
flawed
concept
of
conscience
,
denying
the
need
for
formation
in
the
truth
,
and
treating
mere
desire
as
an
absolute
.


Conscience
is
indeed
a
decision-maker
,
but
it
must
be
freely
submitted
to
the
law
of
God
,
to
which
it
is
a
witness
,
not
an
arbiter
.



The
error
lies
not
in
affirming
the
freedom
of
conscience
to
decide
,
but
in
misinterpreting
the
nature
of
such
freedom
.


Freedom
of
conscience
must
be
at
the
service
of
moral
truth
but
can
never
be
its
determinant
.

,
principal
author
of
this
document
,
anticipated
this
kind
of
dishonesty
.


He
stated
in
a
footnote
to
the
Abbott‑Gallagher
edition
of
the
Council
texts
:


The
Declaration
does
not
base
the
right
to
the
free
exercise
of

religion
on
“freedom
of
conscience
.

”
Nowhere
does
this
phrase
occur
.



And
the
Declaration
nowhere
lends
its
authority
to
the
theory
for

which
the
phrase
frequently
stands
,
namely
,
that
I
have
the
right
to

do
what
my
conscience
tells
me
to
do
,
simply
because
my
conscience

tells
me
to
do
it
.


This
is
a
perilous
theory
.


Its
particular
peril
is

subjectivism
―
the
notion
that
,
in
the
end
,
it
is
my
conscience
,
and

not
the
objective
truth
,
which
determines
what
is
right
and
wrong
,

true
or
false
.

The
Bible
contains
many
references
to
the
human
conscience
.


It
describes
the
fate
of
someone
who
does
not
guard
or
“keep”
his
conscience
(Hebrews
9
:14
and
1
Peter
3
:16)
,
and
who
allows
his
conscience
to
become
“seared”
(1
Timothy
4
:2)
.


The
Bible
also
speaks
of
a
“weak
conscience”
(1
Corinthians
8
:7)
,
a
“wounded
conscience”
(1
Corinthians
8
:12)
,
a
“good”
and
“perfect”
conscience
(Hebrews
9
:9
and
13
:18
;
1
Peter
3
:21
;
and
1
Timothy
1
:5
,19)
;
a
“clear”
or
blameless
conscience
(Acts
24
:16
and
1
Timothy
3
:9)
,
and
a
conscience
that
is
“evil”
or
defiled
(Titus
1
:15)
.

Examining
the
Role
of
Conscience
in
Making
Moral
Decisions

 [Examining
the
Role
of
Conscience
in
Making
Moral
Decisions]

[]

[]

Q
:
I
disagree
with
some
of
the
teachings
of
the
Catholic
Church
.


I
was
once
told
that
I
don’t
have
to
follow
all
of
the
church’s
teachings
if
they
violate
my
conscience
.


But
still
,
I’m
not
sure
that’s
right
.



A
:
First
,
I
want
to
commend
you
for
asking
this
question
.


The
fact
that
you
were
moved
to
ask
demonstrates
two
things
:
that
God’s
grace
can
be
operative
in
every
person
who
is
open
to
him
,
and
secondly
that
you
are
sincere
in
your
desire
to
do
God’s
will
.



I
have
run
into
a
number
of
people
in
a
similar
predicament
as
you
.


They
asked
someone
who
ought
to
be
able
to
give
some
guidance
on
what
was
a
difficult
moral
question
.


In
response
,
they
seemed
to
get
an
answer
that
indicated
that
,
in
the
end
,
they
had
to
just
“follow
their
conscience
.

”

I
can
understand
this
.


In
the
course
of
my
life
as
a
priest
,
I
have
(like
all
of
my
brother
priests)
been
asked
to
weigh
in
on
life
situations
in
which
there
were
no
easy
or
obvious
answers
.


At
times
,
after
going
through
all
of
the
tools
and
resources
the
church
offers
for
right
decision-making
,
the
right
way
to
go
remained
foggy
and
difficult
.




“When
he
listens
to
his
conscience
,
the
prudent
man
can
hear
God

speaking”
—CCC
1777

In
addition
,
the
Catechism
of
the
Catholic
Church
teaches
:
“When
he
listens
to
his
conscience
,
the
prudent
man
can
hear
God
speaking”
(CCC
1777)
.


Because
of
this
line
and
others
that
highlight
the
importance
of
conscience
,
it
is
tempting
to
take
the
default
position
of
“whatever
you
feel
is
right
,
just
do
that
.

”

I
am
not
denying
this
.


After
all
,
this
is
clearly
part
of
the
catechism
.


(I’m
not
about
to
go
toe-to-toe
with
the
catechism
and
think
that
I
can
win
!


I’m
not
that
smart
.

)
But
it
misses
crucial
pieces
of
information
.



First
,
while
it
is
essential
that
we
are
sincere
in
the
decisions
we
make
,
we
don’t
only
have
an
obligation
to
ourselves
.


This
is
something
that
we
have
lost
in
our
culture
.



We
think
that
“to
thine
own
self
be
true”
is
the
highest
commandment
.


It
isn’t
.


While
it
is
good
to
be
truthful
and
interiorly
at
peace
,
we
also
must
be
true
to
others
.


It’s
even
more
essential
that
we
are
true
to
God
.


We
may
have
an
obligation
to
strive
for
authenticity
,
but
we
also
have
an
obligation
to
obey
God
.


I
am
not
the
only
one
to
whom
I
must
be
true
.



Second
,
the
church’s
teaching
on
conscience
presumes
knowledge
of
the
moral
law
.


This
means
that
those
who
are
exercising
conscience
know
that
there
is
a
real
right
and
a
real
wrong
.


Unfortunately
,
there
are
fewer
people
who
acknowledge
this
reality
.


This
places
us
in
a
unique
place
in
human
history
.




We
may
have
an
obligation
to
strive
for
authenticity
,
but
we
also
have

an
obligation
to
obey
God
.



A
recent
study
reported
that
only
8
percent
of
American
teenagers
believe
in
a
real
right
and
a
real
wrong
.


This
ignorance
is
unprecedented
.


Notre
Dame
sociologist
Christian
Smith
recently
concluded
a
nationwide
study
on
the
moral
life
of
18-
to
29-year-olds
.


His
conclusion
was
that
this
age
group
,
generally
speaking
,
has
neither
the
vocabulary
nor
the
categories
to
make
moral
decisions
.


If
conscience
depends
on
principles
of
right
and
wrong
,
how
will
these
young
people
make
decisions
?


According
to
Smith
,
they
base
their
decisions
on
feelings
.



But
conscience
is
not
a
feeling
.


The
catechism
clearly
states
that
conscience
“formulates
its
judgments
according
to
reason
,
in
conformity
with
the
true
good
willed
by
the
wisdom
of
the
Creator”
(CCC
1783)
.


This
means
employing
one’s
mind
more
than
one’s
emotions
to
make
decisions
.


Conscience
is
not
merely
some
feeling
we
get
;
it
is
the
critical
application
of
truth
to
the
present
issue
.



Third
,
it
is
true
that
,
a
person
“must
not
be
forced
to
act
contrary
to
his
conscience
.


Nor
must
he
be
prevented
from
acting
according
to
his
conscience
,
especially
in
religious
matters”
(CCC
1782)
.


But
this
does
not
mean
doing
whatever
pleases
me
.



Let’s
take
a
potentially
explosive
issue
.


When
Pope
Paul
VI
reinforced
the
church’s
constant
teaching
against
artificial
birth
control
in
the
document
“Humanae
Vitae
,”
many
couples
were
encouraged
to
dismiss
this
teaching
if
it
“violated
their
conscience
.

”
Unfortunately
,
as
a
result
,
many
couples
were
obliquely
encouraged
to
invite
a
sinful
practice
into
their
sexual
relationship
.


Even
more
,
they
were
led
to
believe
that
they
could
dismiss
virtually
any
official
and
binding
church
teaching
if
they
disliked
it
.



Because
that
is
all
this
comes
down
to
.


The
church’s
teaching
on
contraception
does
not
“violate”
a
person’s
conscience
.


Unless
a
person
truly
believed
that
periodic
abstinence
in
marriage
was
an
evil
(which
is
all
that
is
being
asked
for
through
natural
family
planning)
,
then
there
is
no
conscience
issue
here
.


It
is
an
issue
of
a)
not
knowing
or
understanding
the
church’s
teaching
(which
could
be
remedied
by
asking
someone
who
knows)
,
b)
lacking
the
will
to
choose
the
good
(which
is
always
an
issue
for
every
person
striving
to
live
virtuously
,
but
not
a
good
reason
to
choose
sin
over
virtue)
,
or
c)
a
matter
of
personal
dislike
for
a
particular
teaching
or
the
church
in
general
.




Seek
to
do
his
will
above
absolutely
all
else
.


Even
in
very
difficult

circumstances
,
God
can
be
trusted
.



After
all
of
this
,
if
we
still
have
reasonable
doubt
regarding
what
to
do
,
we
ought
to
do
the
following
.


First
,
pray
.


Second
,
it
is
wise
to
examine
your
conscience
regularly
.


Third
,
choose
to
do
good
.


Fourth
,
seek
wise
and
holy
counsel
from
someone
who
is
not
only
educated
in
the
area
of
morality
but
who
personally
defers
to
the
wisdom
of
Christ
and
his
church
in
all
things
.


Lastly
,
trust
God
.


He
comes
to
our
aid
in
times
of
weakness
and
confusion
.


Seek
to
do
his
will
above
absolutely
all
else
.


Even
in
very
difficult
circumstances
,
God
can
be
trusted
.

What
is
Freedom
of
Conscience
?




Whether
they’re
happening
inside
the
Church
or
out
in
the
public
square
,
debates
about
how
far
freedom
of
conscience
extends
can
be
confusing
.


Should
Christians
be
compelled
to
take
a
vaccine
that’s
been
tested
on
the
fetal
remains
of
an
aborted
child
?


Should
Christian
business
owners
have
a
right
to
refuse
a
service
that
would
violate
their
conscience
,
like
baking
a
wedding
cake
for
a
same-sex
ceremony
?


How
do
Christians
respond
to
government
mandates
or
policies
that
they
cannot
follow
in
good
conscience
?


And
how
do
we
deal
with
conscientious
disagreement
within
the
Church
?



The
specifics
of
freedom
of
conscience
can
be
complex
and
nuanced
and
are
often
misunderstood
.


Abraham
Kuyper
called
the
conscience
:

“the
shield
of
the
human
person
,
the
root
of
civil
liberties
,
the
source
of
a
nation’s
happiness
.

”

Why
is
it
so
important
?


To
answer
that
question
,
let’s
begin
by
looking
at
what
the
conscience
is
and
is
not
.



What
is
“conscience”
?



Definitions
of
conscience
vary
,
but
they
center
around
the
idea
of
what
someone
believes
to
be
right
and
wrong
.


The
conscience
is
a
moral
compass
that
helps
direct
people’s
actions
.


In
that
sense
,
conscience
is
personal
and
subjective
because
it
condemns
or
excuses
one’s
own
conduct
,
not
that
of
another
person
–
after
all
,
you
don’t
get
a
guilty
conscience
because
of
someone
else’s
behavior
.



However
,
conscience
is
also
based
on
an
objective
and
general
standard
.


The
Bible
explains
that
the
conscience
is
given
by
God
to
both
Christians
and
non-Christians
and
it
helps
people
apply
their
knowledge
of
right
and
wrong
to
their
behavior
,
both
past
actions
and
decisions
about
future
actions
.


The
New
Testament
also
speaks
of
the
importance
of
having
a
good
conscience
by
following
its
direction
and
doing
what
is
right
(see
Rom
.


2
:15
,
1
Tim
.


1
:5)
.



[]Christian
political
scientist
David
Koyzis
,
in
his
book
We
Answer
to
Another
,
tells
a
story
about
the
Milgram
Experiment
which
relates
well
to
conscience
.


The
experiment
was
a
study
designed
to
look
at
how
people
respond
to
authority
.


The
experimenter
would
select
two
participants
and
assign
one
the
role
of
teacher
,
while
another
volunteer
would
be
given
the
role
of
student
.


The
person
selected
as
the
teacher
was
instructed
to
apply
an
electrical
shock
of
increasing
voltage
to
the
other
person
–
the
student
–
who
was
in
a
different
room
.


Now
,
unbeknownst
to
the
teacher
,
the
other
person
was
actually
an
actor
being
paid
to
play
the
part
.


Although
the
teacher
could
hear
the
apparent
pain
experienced
by
the
person
in
the
next
room
,
most
individuals
would
continue
applying
electric
shocks
–
despite
increasing
screams
and
pleas
to
stop
–
when
instructed
to
do
so
by
the
experimenter
.


However
,
two
participants
were
unwilling
to
keep
going
along
with
the
instructions
.


Both
were
Christians
.


They
followed
the
experiment
instructor’s
commands
for
a
time
but
stopped
sooner
than
most
other
participants
,
knowing
that
they
were
responsible
for
their
actions
and
stating
that
they
were
answerable
to
a
higher
authority
.



When
asked
to
do
something
wrong
,
we
too
are
responsible
for
our
actions
and
answerable
to
a
higher
authority
.



Ultimately
,
the
foundation
for
freedom
of
conscience
is
found
in
the
sovereignty
of
God
.


Every
human
being
has
various
authorities
in
their
lives
,
such
as
parents
,
employers
,
church
leadership
,
or
civil
government
.


Each
of
these
has
legitimate
authority
over
us
,
but
that
authority
is
also
limited
.


The
only
One
who
is
sovereign
over
the
conscience
is
God
,
and
if
another
authority
commands
us
to
do
what
we
believe
is
sin
–
what
we
believe
violates
how
God
wants
us
to
act
–
then
we
can
appeal
to
freedom
of
conscience
.


The
conscience
is
a
shield
that
protects
against
the
abuse
of
authority
and
points
instead
to
the
one
Higher
Authority
.



Conscience
and
the
public
square

Debates
around
conscience
are
becoming
increasingly
relevant
in
our
society
and
are
most
noticeable
within
certain
vocations
.


Can
medical
professionals
refuse
to
help
a
patient
access
abortion
,
assisted
suicide
,
or
sex-change
surgery
?


Can
marriage
officiants
refuse
to
marry
a
same-sex
couple
?


Can
a
photographer
decline
a
request
to
take
photos
at
a
same-sex
ceremony
?


Can
a
publisher
decline
to
print
pro-abortion
pamphlets
?



Increasingly
,
our
society
answers
“no
.

”
To
allow
people
to
conscientiously
object
is
seen
as
simply
discriminatory
and
bigoted
.


Our
society
needs
to
understand
that
a
conscientious
objection
in
these
cases
is
not
a
rejection
of
an
individual
person
,
but
a
refusal
to
commit
what
the
objector
believes
to
be
a
sin
or
to
participate
in
sinful
activity
.



Today
it’s
often
Christians
who
are
being
pressured
to
violate
their
conscience
.


However
,
there
are
others
who
seek
the
same
protections
for
their
conscience
.


It’s
this
freedom
that
an
atheist
doctor
appeals
to
when
he
determines
he
cannot
participate
in
euthanasia
,
based
on
his
oath
to
do
no
harm
.


And
what
of
the
fashion
designers
,
back
in
2016
,
who
had
principled
objections
to
designing
an
inauguration
dress
for
First
Lady
Melania
Trump
?


When
these
designers
announced
they
would
not
make
the
dress
because
they
didn’t
want
to
be
associated
with
newly
elected
President
Donald
Trump’s
administration
,
many
celebrated
their
decision
as
taking
a
principled
stand
.


Likewise
,
some
in
our
society
want
abortion-supporting
publishers
to
be
allowed
to
decline
print
orders
for
pro-life
material
,
or
for
a
gay
business
owner
to
be
allowed
to
refuse
to
rent
a
hall
for
an
event
that
promotes
biblical
marriage
.



Yet
increasingly
,
the
same
people
want
to
see
Christians
reprimanded
for
acting
according
to
their
beliefs
.



For
Christians
,
the
answer
to
the
questions
above
might
be
easy
.


But
we
have
our
own
disputes
about
conscience
within
the
Church
as
well
,
such
as
what
kind
of
entertainment
is
permissible
or
what
it
looks
like
to
honor
the
Sabbath
Day
outside
of
corporate
worship
.



When
conscience
pricks

Of
note
,
the
strongest
commands
of
conscience
are
often
negative
,
in
terms
of
what
you
are
not
permitted
to
do
,
rather
than
what
you
may
or
must
do
.


For
example
,
if
you
use
foul
language
,
your
conscience
will
likely
bother
you
more
than
if
you
fail
to
correct
someone
else
using
such
language
.


Or
,
if
a
publisher
prints
pro-abortion
pamphlets
that
he
objects
to
,
his
conscience
will
make
him
feel
guilty
more
than
if
he
fails
to
promote
life
as
he
believes
he
ought
.



When
the
conscience
commands
a
person
not
to
do
something
,
the
command
is
about
a
very
specific
action
.


Alternatively
,
if
the
command
is
instead
to
act
on
something
good
,
there
are
often
various
ways
of
pursuing
that
good
.



Conscience
and
the
Church

Because
of
sin
,
no
person’s
conscience
is
perfectly
aligned
with
what
God
commands
in
His
Word
.


The
chart
below
is
based
on
one
from
a
helpful
book
titled
Conscience
:
What
It
Is
,
How
To
Train
It
,
and
Loving
Those
Who
Differ
,
by
Andrew
Naselli
and
J
.

D
.


Crowley
.


The
authors
used
it
to
explain
the
difference
between
two
people’s
consciences
,
and
how
they
compare
to
God’s
will
.


The
letters
within
the
chart
refer
to
different
rules
or
principles
of
right
and
wrong
.



Both
Arnold
and
Zoey
have
added
rules
to
their
conscience
that
are
not
commanded
in
Scripture
.


For
example
,
perhaps
Arnold
has
a
history
of
alcohol
abuse
in
his
family
,
so
he
adds
letter
‘C’
which
commands
him
not
to
drink
alcohol
to
avoid
temptation
.


Maybe
letters
‘D’
and
‘E’
are
Arnold’s
belief
that
he
must
not
play
cards
or
any
games
involving
dice
.


Arnold
and
Zoey
have
also
both
failed
to
include
letter
‘B’
in
their
conscience
.


Perhaps
this
is
a
failure
to
consistently
honor
the
Sabbath
Day
,
and
their
consciences
no
longer
accuse
them
for
it
.


However
,
Arnold
and
Zoey’s
consciences
are
both
aligned
with
God’s
will
in
letters
‘J’
through
‘M
,’
where
they
have
rightly
applied
biblical
principles
and
commands
to
their
lives
and
consciences
.


The
natural
tendency
is
to
think
that
if
another
person
has
more
rules
than
us
,
they
are
legalistic
.


Alternatively
,
if
they
have
fewer
rules
,
they
are
failing
to
live
as
Christians
.


However
,
Scripture
remains
the
standard
to
which
we
must
seek
to
align
our
conscience
.



[]

The
conscience
can
easily
become
oversensitive
by
including
rules
that
are
not
matters
of
right
and
wrong
.


We
see
examples
of
the
Pharisees
in
the
New
Testament
who
created
additional
rules
for
the
Sabbath
and
wanted
everyone
to
abide
by
them
.


We
might
feel
unnecessarily
guilty
if
we
do
not
abide
by
similar
rules
on
the
Sabbath
.



Alternatively
,
conscience
can
become
desensitized
.


Perhaps
you
use
or
tolerate
foul
language
that
would
have
shocked
you
a
decade
ago
,
or
you
consume
entertainment
that
you
would
have
been
ashamed
of
years
earlier
.


Our
conscience
does
not
always
accurately
tell
us
what
is
sin
and
what
is
not
.


While
it
might
not
always
make
sense
to
follow
conscience
in
relation
to
other
authorities
,
we
have
a
duty
to
obey
it
because
we
cannot
commit
what
we
believe
is
sin
.



At
the
same
time
,
we
should
be
careful
when
dealing
with
the
consciences
of
other
people
.


In
1
Corinthians
8
,
the
Apostle
Paul
talks
about
whether
believers
can
eat
meat
offered
to
idols
and
refers
to
consideration
for
brothers
and
sisters
with
a
weaker
conscience
.


So
,
if
we
believe
a
brother
or
sister
has
a
weaker
conscience
,
we
must
not
be
a
stumbling
block
to
them
and
cause
them
to
disobey
their
conscience
.


On
disputable
issues
,
we
may
realize
that
someone
has
a
weaker
conscience
,
and
we
can
discuss
the
biblical
principles
that
apply
.


Or
perhaps
they
have
a
stronger
conscience
,
and
they
can
help
us
understand
where
our
conscience
is
not
aligned
to
Scripture
.



Again
,
conscience
is
not
meant
to
be
some
wishy-washy
idea
where
everyone
can
believe
what
they
want
,
like
in
the
time
of
the
judges
of
Israel
,
when
“everyone
did
what
was
right
in
his
own
eyes
.

”
There
are
direct
,
objective
commands
and
principles
that
can
be
taken
from
Scripture
.


There
are
many
issues
which
should
not
be
disputable
for
Christians
and
are
clear
in
the
Bible
.



However
,
there
are
also
issues
where
serious
Christians
can
come
to
different
conclusions
about
what
God
commands
.


For
example
,
what
activities
are
not
permitted
on
the
Sabbath
?


Or
perhaps
more
current
,
how
do
we
navigate
government
restrictions
and
the
call
to
honor
our
authorities
versus
our
callings
to
obey
what
God
demands
of
us
?


What
about
masking
,
vaccines
,
etc
.


,
both
within
the
public
square
and
the
Church
?


Christian
conscience
differs
on
these
issues
,
and
believers
can
have
biblical
arguments
for
why
they
think
God
commands
or
prohibits
different
actions
.



What
isn’t
conscience
?



Some
of
us
might
react
to
the
idea
that
conscience
is
a
kind
of
subjective
belief
that
is
not
accountable
to
other
people
.


We
can’t
simply
say
,
“well
,
what’s
right
for
you
isn’t
necessarily
right
for
me
.

”
Conscience
is
not
merely
a
personal
preference
like
your
favorite
food
or
music
.


It
is
also
not
license
to
do
whatever
you
please
and
ignore
other
authorities
.


Rather
,
freedom
of
conscience
refers
to
moral
beliefs
that
respect
a
limited
sphere
of
individual
authority
while
still
recognizing
other
legitimate
authorities
that
can
impose
obligations
on
us
.



As
such
,
the
conscience
is
not
unlimited
.


Some
people
might
abuse
the
ability
to
claim
conscientious
objection
out
of
self-interest
or
to
simply
justify
their
actions
.


Authorities
such
as
the
civil
government
,
church
government
,
employers
,
or
parents
do
have
power
to
compel
or
deny
certain
actions
.



However
,
if
the
civil
government
(or
other
authorities)
limits
conscience
,
they
must
provide
good
justification
for
doing
so
and
seek
to
accommodate
conscientious
objectors
as
much
as
they
are
able
,
such
as
through
exemptions
for
freedom
of
conscience
.


Abraham
Kuyper
again
shows
the
importance
of
conscience
,
stating
that
:

“Ten
times
better
is
a
state
in
which
a
few
eccentrics
can
make
themselves
a
laughingstock
for
a
time
by
abusing
freedom
of
conscience
,
than
a
state
in
which
these
eccentricities
are
prevented
by
violating
conscience
itself
.

”

Conclusion

Ultimately
,
conscience
belongs
to
an
individual
and
is
accountable
to
God
.


However
,
it
should
also
be
rooted
in
Biblical
commands
and
principles
.


Increasingly
,
we
encounter
disagreements
in
the
Church
about
various
issues
,
while
in
the
public
square
some
Christians’
jobs
are
threatened
because
the
State
fails
to
recognize
conscience
.


On
many
matters
,
Christians
will
refuse
to
do
something
they
believe
is
evil
even
if
others
do
not
believe
the
action
is
wrong
.


The
Church
has
an
opportunity
to
continue
to
show
our
society
what
it
means
to
live
according
to
moral
standards
based
on
the
will
and
Sovereignty
of
God
.


Wherever
we
find
ourselves
,
let’s
seek
to
say
,
“I
myself
always
strive
to
have
a
conscience
without
offense
toward
God
and
men”
(Acts
24
:16)
.

Human
Rights

Should
Christians
be
free
to
obey
our
conscience
?



In
recent
years
there’s
been
a
worrying
downward
trend
for
religious
freedom
in
both
Canada
and
the
United
States
.


Examples
abound
of
Christian
T-shirt
printers
,
bakers
,
photographers
,
print-shop
owners
,
wedding
dress
makers
,
florists
and
caterers
who
are
being
forced
–
through
human
rights
commissions
,
or
through
lawsuits
–
to
participate
in
same-sex
weddings
in
violation
of
these
various
business
peoples
'

consciences
.


Each
of
these
Christian
business
people
said
they
would
bake
,
cater
,
arrange
flowers
,
print
invitations
,
take
photos
,
print
T-shirts
,
etc
.


for
a
gay
person
'
s
birthday
or
retirement
party
or
any
other
celebration
–
they
just
wouldn’t
do
it
for
a
same-sex
wedding
(the
only
exception
was
the
wedding
dress
maker
,
for
obvious
reasons)
.


This
means
the
objection
is
not
about
discriminating
against
gay
people
.


It
never
was
.


It
'
s
very
specifically
about
endorsing
a
definition
of
marriage
or
a
specific
act
that
fundamentally
violates
God
'
s
design
for
marriage
.


Stand
up
for
others
I
know
of
Christians
who
can
,
with
a
clean
conscience
,
bake
,
photograph
,
etc
.


a
gay
wedding
.


And
I
know
some
who
can
'
t
(see
1
Cor
.


8)
.


This
is
a
legitimate
discussion
to
have
between
Christians
.


The
much
bigger
question
is
:
should
the
State
force
the
latter
group
to
do
as
the
former
?


If
you
are
a
Christian
and
you
advocate
that
the
State
is
justified
in
making
Christians
participate
,
in
any
way
,
in
a
gay
marriage
,
I
believe
you
'
ve
ripped
the
rug
from
under
yourself
–
if
it
is
fine
for
the
State
to
violate
other
Christians’
consciences
this
time
,
what
'
s
to
prevent
them
from
violating
yours
next
?


If
a
Christian
photographer
has
to
shoot
a
gay
wedding
,
does
a
church
have
to
rent
their
hall
for
a
gay
wedding
?


(This
happened
in
British
Columbia
in
2005)
.


Or
must
an
organist
play
for
a
gay
marriage
ceremony
?


Or
will
a
Christian
marriage
commissioner
be
forced
to
officiate
for
such
a
celebration
?


(In
Saskatchewan
and
Manitoba
,
this
is
the
case)
.


Negative
implications
of
the
bill
for
Christians
Does
this
mean
that
I’m
ready
to
let
the
State
allow
the
same
kind
of
discrimination
against
Christians
?


If
an
atheist
decides
he
doesn
'
t
want
to
take
photos
of
a
Christian
wedding
,
am
I
okay
with
that
?


Well
,
the State
can
'
t
force
all
citizens
to
embrace
,
encourage
and
support
the
Christian
faith
,
because
that wouldn
'
t
be
freedom
of
religion
,
would
it
?


Freedom
of
religion
is
freedom
from
the
State
,
and
not
from
fellow
citizens
.


Your
Charter
rights
protect
you
from
the
busybody
government
interfering
in
your
religious
practices
and
beliefs
.


They
are
not
meant
to
make
the
government
interfere
in
your
personal
or
professional
relationships
in
order
to
promote
,
oppose
or
defend
your
religion
.


So
,
to
be
clear
and
consistent
,
I
do
expect
and
accept
being
shunned
by
others
because
of
my
Christian
beliefs
.


(Christ
predicted
it
,
didn
'
t
he
?

)
I
would
not
expect
the
State
to
go
to
bat
for
me
if
a
gay
bookstore
refused
to
sell
my
book
on
a
Biblical
understanding
of
gay-marriage
,
or
if
an
Islamic
school
refused
to
hire
me
as
a
janitor
.


If
I
wanted
to
publish
a
Christian
defense
of
capital
punishment
,
I
wouldn
'
t
expect
the
State
to
force
a
Mennonite
printer
to
publish
it
for
me
.


With
liberty
comes
responsibility
.


That
includes
responsibility
to
go
find
another
printer
,
or
baker
or
candlestick
maker
.

By
“intellectual
conscience
,”
Nietzsche
means
the
idea
that
it
is
wrong
to
believe
something
unless
you
have
good
reason
to
think
that
the
belief
is
true
.


Someone
with
an
intellectual
conscience
will
form
and
endorse
beliefs
by
applying
the
best
epistemic
standards
known
to
him
or
her
.



Most
of
us
,
Nietzsche
thinks
,
lack
an
intellectual
conscience
:

[T]he
great
majority
of
people
lacks
an
intellectual
conscience
.


[…]
I
mean
:
the
great
majority
of
people
does
not
consider
it
contemptible
to
believe
this
or
that
and
to
live
accordingly
,
without
first
having
given
themselves
an
account
of
the
final
and
most
certain
reasons
pro
and
con
,
and
without
even
troubling
themselves
about
such
reasons
afterward…
.


(The
Gay
Science
§2
.

)

Exercising
the
intellectual
conscience
,
if
one
does
possess
it
,
doesn’t
necessarily
lead
to
certainty
;
on
the
contrary
.


The
more
you
subject
your
beliefs
to
scrutiny
,
the
less
certain
you
will
become
about
them
.


This
is
good
,
because
searching
for
the
truth
,
as
well
as
finding
it
,
is
good
.


Bernard
Reginster
puts
the
point
as
follows
:

[T]he
seeker
after
knowledge
must
want
both
knowledge
and
uncertainty
or
ignorance
.


He
cannot
be
a
genuine
seeker
after
truth
unless
he
actually
wants
to
find
it
,
but
since
what
he
cares
about
is
the
search
after
truth
,
he
must
also
welcome
the
uncertainty
and
ignorance
that
supply
opportunities
for
it
.


(The
Affirmation
of
Life
:
Nietzsche
on
Overcoming
Nihilism
.

)

Although
intellectual
conscience
is
a
necessary
condition
,
it
is
not
,
Nietzsche
seems
to
think
,
a
sufficient
one
.


The
“last
idealists
of
knowledge
in
whom
alone
the
intellectual
conscience
dwells
today
,”
namely
the
scientists
,
have
rendered
Christian
belief
untenable
,
but
they
shrink
from
questioning
their
own
values
.


“These
are
by
no
means
free
spirits
:
for
they
still
believe
in
[the
value
of]
truth
.

”
(On
the
Genealogy
of
Morals
,
III
§24
.

)

Properly
employed
by
an
authentic
free
spirit
,
intellectual
conscience
works
against
the
tendency
to
assimilate
novel
experiences
or
problems
to
already-familiar
explanations
and
evaluations
.


By
eroding
convictions
and
multiplying
possibilities
,
it
counteracts
the
disposition
to
simplify
and
unify
and
makes
it
less
likely
to
get
stuck
in
any
one
perspective
.



The
best
article
I
know
of
on
Nietzsche’s
concept
of
intellectual
conscience
is
Jeremy
Page’s
“Nietzsche
on
Honesty”
(2019)

How
does
the
conscious
differ
from
the
conscience
?


Being
conscious
is
the
state
of
being
awake
and
alert
.


Conscience
,
on
the
other
hand
,
refers
to
an
awareness
of
whether
actions
are
right
or
wrong
.



These
two
terms
are
sometimes
confused
in
common
everyday
usage
because
they
sound
quite
similar
.


However
,
as
you
can
see
,
they
mean
very
different
things
within
the
field
of
psychology
.



At
a
Glance

While
the
two
terms
are
often
confused
,
the
conscious
and
the
conscience
refer
to
very
different
things
.


Your
conscious
allows
you
to
be
aware
of
your
place
in
the
world
,
while
your
conscience
allows
you
to
behave
in
this
world
in
morally
and
socially
acceptable
ways
.


As
described
below
,
being
conscious
refers
to
your
awareness
of
yourself
and
the
world
around
you
.


Your
conscience
is
your
ability
to
distinguish
between
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
.




What
Does
Conscience
Mean
?




Your
conscience
is
the
part
of
your
personality
that
helps
you
determine
right
and
wrong
and
keeps
you
from
acting
upon
your
most
basic
urges
and
desires
.



Your
conscience
is
what
makes
you
feel
guilty
when
you
do
something
bad
and
good
when
you
do
something
kind
.



It
is
the
moral
basis
that
helps
guide
prosocial
behavior
,
or
behavior
that
helps
others
,
and
leads
you
to
behave
in
socially
acceptable
and
even
altruistic
ways
.



In
Freudian
theory
,
the
conscience
is
part
of
the
superego
that
contains
information
about
what
is
viewed
as
bad
or
negative
by
your
parents
and
by
society—all
the
values
you
learned
and
absorbed
during
your
upbringing
.


The
conscience
emerges
over
time
as
you
take
in
information
about
what
is
considered
right
and
wrong
by
your
caregivers
,
your
peers
,
and
the
culture
in
which
you
live
.



One
way
a
child’s
sense
of
morality
might
develop
is
through
their
caregiver
'
s
rules
.


For
example
,
if
a
parent
sets
a
rule
,
a
child
could
learn
a
sense
of
right
and
wrong
regarding
that
topic
.


Studies
have
also
examined
other
factors
that
may
affect
the
way
conscience
develops
,
including
the
nature
of
the
parent-child
relationship
,
style
of
parental
discipline
,
and
the
child
'
s
temperament—but
more
research
is
needed
.




What
Does
Conscious
Mean
?




Your
conscious
is
your
awareness
of
yourself
and
the
world
around
you
.


In
the
most
general
terms
,
it
means
being
awake
and
aware
.


Some
experts
suggest
that
you
are
considered
conscious
of
something
if
you
are
able
to
put
it
into
words
.



Not
only
can
you
be
conscious—as
in
awake—but
you
can
also
be
conscious—as
in
aware—of
your
thoughts
and
feelings
.




The
Conscious
Mind


In
psychology
,
the
conscious
mind
includes
everything
inside
your
awareness
,
including
:

-
Fantasies
-
Feelings
-
Memories
-
Perceptions
-
Thoughts

A
metaphor
that
is
sometimes
used
to
explain
the
concept
of
the
conscious
mind
within
psychoanalytic
theory
is
likening
the
mind
to
an
iceberg
.


The
part
of
the
iceberg
that
can
be
seen
above
the
surface
of
the
water
represents
conscious
awareness
.


It
is
what
we
are
aware
of
and
can
describe
and
articulate
clearly
.



The
largest
part
of
the
iceberg
actually
lies
below
the
surface
of
the
water
.


This
represents
the
unconscious
mind
and
includes
all
the
thoughts
,
memories
,
and
urges
that
are
outside
of
our
conscious
awareness
.


This
metaphor
is
frequently
attributed
to
Sigmund
Freud
,
but
according
to
the
American
Psychological
Association
(APA)
,
he
never
wrote
about
it
.




What
Is
Consciousness
?




Your
consciousness
refers
to
your
conscious
experiences
,
your
individual
awareness
of
your
own
internal
thoughts
,
feelings
,
memories
,
and
sensations
.



Consciousness
is
often
thought
of
as
a
stream
,
constantly
shifting
according
to
the
ebb
and
flow
of
your
thoughts
and
experiences
of
the
world
around
you
.



"Consciousness
is
generally
defined
as
awareness
of
your
thoughts
,
actions
,
feelings
,
sensations
,
perceptions
,
and
other
mental
processes
,"
explain
psychologists
Douglass
A
.


Bernstein
,
Louis
A
.


Penner
,
and
Edward
Roy
.



In
other
words
,
they
say
,
this
suggests
that
consciousness
isn
'
t
just
one
mental
process
but
rather
a
part
of
many
.


"For
example
,
memories
can
be
conscious
,
but
consciousness
is
not
just
memory
.


Perceptions
can
be
conscious
,
but
consciousness
is
not
just
perception
.

"

The
conscious
and
consciousness
can
be
difficult
to
pin
down
.


As
psychologist
and
philosopher
William
James
once
explained
,
"Its
meaning
we
know
so
long
as
no
one
asks
us
to
define
it
.

"

Consciousness
in
Psychology


Breaking
Down
the
Differences


Conscience

-
Noun

-
Moral
awareness

-
Acts
as
a
moral
compass

Conscious

-
Adjective

-
Mental
awareness

-
Means
a
person
is
awake
and
responsive

To
further
explain
their
differences
,
here
are
examples
of
how
the
terms
conscience
and
conscious
could
be
used
in
a
sentence
.




Conscience


They
had
a
guilty
conscience
because
they
cheated
on
the
test
.



The
term
conscience
here
describes
this
person
'
s
sense
of
what
is
right
and
wrong
and
the
subsequent
feeling
of
guilt
they
have
over
cheating
on
the
test
.




Conscious


They
were
worried
they
might
faint
at
the
sight
of
the
blood
,
but
they
remained
conscious
.



The
person
was
afraid
they
would
lose
consciousness
by
fainting
when
they
saw
blood
.


However
,
they
didn
'
t
faint
and
stayed
awake
and
aware
of
their
surroundings
.



They
were
conscious
of
the
fact
that
everyone
was
staring
at
them
.



The
term
conscious
here
describes
the
awareness
of
the
person
who
noticed
that
everyone
was
looking
at
them
.



Tip
:

When
thinking
about
these
two
concepts
,
just
remember
that
conscious
means
to
be
awake
and
aware
while
conscience
refers
to
your
inner
sense
of
right
and
wrong
.




Common
Uses


-
Guilty
conscience
:
Indicates
that
someone
feels
guilty
about
their

actions
-
Clear
conscience
:
Suggests
that
people 
-
Conscious
of
your
words
:
Suggests
that
you
are
aware
of
the
effect

your
words
may
have
and
thus
choose
them
with
caution
.


-
Cost-conscious
:
Indicates
that
a
person
is
concerned
about
prices

and
makes
choices
to
conserve
money
and
stay
within
a
budget
-
The
patient
was
conscious
:
Indicates
that
a
person
was
awake
and

aware

It
'
s
definitely
easy
to
confuse
the
terms
conscious
and
conscience
,
particularly
when
you
hear
the
words
spoken
out
loud
.


However
,
with
the
help
of
some
context
clues
and
some
attention
to
their
spelling
differences
,
you
should
have
no
problem
telling
them
apart
when
you
come
across
them
.

The

Conscience

I
.


The
Judgment
of
Conscience

1777
Moral
conscience
,⁴⁸
present
at
the
heart
of
the
person
,
enjoins
him
at
the
appropriate
moment
to
do
good
and
to
avoid
evil
.


It
also
judges
particular
choices
,
approving
those
that
are
good
and
denouncing
those
that
are
evil
.

⁴⁹
It
bears
witness
to
the
authority
of
truth
in
reference
to
the
supreme
Good
to
which
the
human
person
is
drawn
,
and
it
welcomes
the
commandments
.


When
he
listens
to
his
conscience
,
the
prudent
man
can
hear
God
speaking
.



1778
Conscience
is
a
judgment
of
reason
whereby
the
human
person
recognizes
the
moral
quality
of
a
concrete
act
that
he
is
going
to
perform
,
is
in
the
process
of
performing
,
or
has
already
completed
.


In
all
he
says
and
does
,
man
is
obliged
to
follow
faithfully
what
he
knows
to
be
just
and
right
.


It
is
by
the
judgment
of
his
conscience
that
man
perceives
and
recognizes
the
prescriptions
of
the
divine
law
:

Conscience
is
a
law
of
the
mind
;
yet
[Christians]
would
not
grant
that
it
is
nothing
more
;
I
mean
that
it
was
not
a
dictate
,
nor
conveyed
the
notion
of
responsibility
,
of
duty
,
of
a
threat
and
a
promise
.


.


.


.


[Conscience]
is
a
messenger
of
him
,
who
,
both
in
nature
and
in
grace
,
speaks
to
us
behind
a
veil
,
and
teaches
and
rules
us
by
his
representatives
.


Conscience
is
the
aboriginal
Vicar
of
Christ
.

⁵⁰

1779
It
is
important
for
every
person
to
be
sufficiently
present
to
himself
in
order
to
hear
and
follow
the
voice
of
his
conscience
.


This
requirement
of
interiority
is
all
the
more
necessary
as
life
often
distracts
us
from
any
reflection
,
self-examination
or
introspection
:

Return
to
your
conscience
,
question
it
.


.


.


.


Turn
inward
,
brethren
,
and
in
everything
you
do
,
see
God
as
your
witness
.

⁵¹

1780
The
dignity
of
the
human
person
implies
and
requires
uprightness
of
moral
conscience
.


Conscience
includes
the
perception
of
the
principles
of
morality
(synderesis)
;
their
application
in
the
given
circumstances
by
practical
discernment
of
reasons
and
goods
;
and
finally
judgment
about
concrete
acts
yet
to
be
performed
or
already
performed
.


the
truth
about
the
moral
good
,
stated
in
the
law
of
reason
,
is
recognized
practically
and
concretely
by
the
prudent
judgment
of
conscience
.


We
call
that
man
prudent
who
chooses
in
conformity
with
this
judgment
.



1781
Conscience
enables
one
to
assume
responsibility
for
the
acts
performed
.


If
man
commits
evil
,
the
just
judgment
of
conscience
can
remain
within
him
as
the
witness
to
the
universal
truth
of
the
good
,
at
the
same
time
as
the
evil
of
his
particular
choice
.


the
verdict
of
the
judgment
of
conscience
remains
a
pledge
of
hope
and
mercy
.


In
attesting
to
the
fault
committed
,
it
calls
to
mind
the
forgiveness
that
must
be
asked
,
the
good
that
must
still
be
practiced
,
and
the
virtue
that
must
be
constantly
cultivated
with
the
grace
of
God
:

We
shall
.


.


.


reassure
our
hearts
before
him
whenever
our
hearts
condemn
us
;
for
God
is
greater
than
our
hearts
,
and
he
knows
everything
.

⁵²

1782
Man
has
the
right
to
act
in
conscience
and
in
freedom
so
as
personally
to
make
moral
decisions
.


"He
must
not
be
forced
to
act
contrary
to
his
conscience
.


Nor
must
he
be
prevented
from
acting
according
to
his
conscience
,
especially
in
religious
matters
.

Friedrich
Wilhelm
Nietzsche
,
German
Philosopher
&
Philologist

In
his
Genealogy
of
Morals
,
Nietzsche
dives
into
the
origin
of
morals
starting
with
two
forms
of
morality
in
the
first
essay
;
the
master
morality
and
the
slave
morality
.


In
order
to
understand
the
subject
of
this
essay
that
discusses
the
origin
of
guilt
and
bad
conscience
,
it
is
vital
to
briefly
demonstrate
the
first
essay
because
the
second
essay
is
followed
by
the
latter
.


In
the
first
essay
of
the
Genealogy
of
Morals
,
Nietzsche
demonstrates
the
origin
of
good
and
evil
and
that
there
are
two
opposing
moralities
.


Nietzsche
names
them
the
‘master
morality
and
the
‘slave
morality
.


The
master
morality
is
associated
with
strength
,
confidence
,
wealth
and
power
,
whereas
the
slave
morality
is
associated
with
weak
,
powerless
,
poor
and
ugly
.



Nietzsche
argues
that
master
morality
does
not
hold
grudges
or
deterred
by
the
actions
of
others
—
it
holds
its
position
and
is
focused
on
doing
the
things
that
it
wants
and
always
believes
in
the
possibility
of
things
.


On
the
contrary
,
the
slave
morality
is
weak
and
therefore
,
it
holds
grudges
against
the
strong
.


The
slave
morality
thinks
that
not
everything
is
possible
because
the
strong
always
win
;
the
slave
morality
,
therefore
,
becomes
jealous
,
vengeful
and
seeks
revenge
from
the
strong
powered
by
ressentiment
.


“All
noble
morality
grows
out
of
a
triumphant
saying
,
‘yes’
to
itself
,
slave
morality
says
‘no’
on
principle
to
everything
that
is
‘outside’
,
‘other’
,
‘non-self’
:
and
this
‘no’
is
its
creative
deed
.


This
reversal
of
the
evaluating
glance
—
this
inevitable
orientation
to
the
outside
instead
of
back
onto
itself
—
is
a
feature
of
ressentiment
.

”
(The
Nietzsche
Reader
,
On
the
Genealogy
of
Morality
:
A
Polemic
,
p400)

In
the
second
essay
of
the
Genealogy
of
Morals
,
Nietzsche
argues
that
humans
and
their
nature
are
different
from
the
rest
of
the
animals
.


It
is
because
of
the
ability
to
make
promises
that
makes
a
human
different
,
superior
and
organised
from
other
species
on
earth
.


The
ability
to
remember
the
promises
made
at
a
certain
point
under
a
specific
condition
;
ought
to
be
delivered
at
a
particular
time
in
future
.


This
promise
has
different
connotations
within
an
individual
,
a
society
and
a
global
realm
.


The
individual
realm
is
concerned
with
direct
interaction
between
two
individuals
,
society
and
the
world
in
itself
.


It
is
because
the
individual
makes
a
promise
at
different
levels
.


For
instance
,
it
promises
another
individual
to
do
a
thing
at
a
specific
time
in
the
future
.


Whilst
,
the
individual
also
makes
a
promise
to
a
society
that
creates
a
relationship
between
the
two
,
as
Rousseau
calls
it
‘social
contract’
.



In
society
,
an
individual
makes
a
promise
not
to
break
the
law
.


This
promise
in
itself
is
a
social
contract
,
according
to
Rousseau
.


Moreover
,
according
to
Nietzsche
,
breaking
a
promise
is
thus
the
origin
of
‘guilt’
where
the
promise-breaker
forgets
to
uphold
the
promise
that
he/she
made
.


“Like
a
doorkeeper
,
or
guardian
of
mental
order
,
rest
and
etiquette
:
from
which
we
can
immediately
see
how
there
could
be
no
happiness
,
cheerfulness
,
hope
,
pride
,
immediacy
,
without
forgetfulness
.

”
(The
Nietzsche
Reader
,
On
the
Genealogy
of
Morality
:
A
Polemic
,
p408)
.


However
,
this
forgetfulness
can
happen
in
two
ways
.


One
which
the
promise-breaker
truly
forgets
and
the
second
in
which
the
promise-breaker
breaks
his/her
promise
intentionally
,
not
because
of
forgetting
it
but
forgetting
it
intentionally
.


The
other
end
to
forgetfulness
is
the
sense
of
ignorance
which
leads
to
more
happiness
as
the
consciousness
of
the
human
forgot
or
yet
to
learn
about
the
things
that
cause
unhappiness
.


As
they
say
,
the
wiser
the
human
becomes
,
the
less
happy
he/she
is
.



One
of
the
reasons
behind
humans
as
a
superior
species
is
their
free
will
and
the
sovereign
soul
that
makes
decisions
based
on
his/her
choice
.


Hence
,
Nietzsche
argues
that
“this
sovereign
—
how
could
he
remain
ignorant
of
his
superiority
over
everybody
else
who
is
not
permitted
to
make
a
promise
or
answer
for
himself
,
how
much
trust
,
fear
and
respect
he
arouses
—
he
‘merits’
all
three
.

”
(The
Nietzsche
Reader
,
On
the
Genealogy
of
Morality
:
A
Polemic
,
p409)
.


The
point
in
which
a
person
makes
a
promise
is
not
only
to
another
person
,
but
he
should
also
‘answer
for
himself’
for
instance
:
I
will
do
this
or
that
.


The
terminology
of
‘I
will’
means
that
‘I
promise’
refers
to
an
action
of
the
future
.


However
,
a
human
breaks
too
many
promises
of
himself
but
breaking
a
promise
for
another
person
will
lead
to
a
severe
sense
of
guilt
.


The
human’s
consciousness
will
push
through
to
uphold
the
promise
.


“What
will
he
call
his
dominant
instinct
,
assuming
that
he
needs
a
word
for
it
?


No
doubt
about
the
answer
:
this
sovereign
man
calls
it
his
conscience
.

”
(The
Nietzsche
Reader
,
On
the
Genealogy
of
Morality
:
A
Polemic
,
p409)
.



Nietzsche
describes
the
parties
involved
in
the
promise
as
the
creditor
and
debtor
,
where
the
debtor
repays
the
creditor
in
the
form
of
punishment
in
which
pain
could
be
extracted
.


The
exchange
in
which
pain
as
a
form
of
debt
is
extracted
from
the
debtor
pays
the
creditor
,
according
to
Nietzsche
,
is
pleasurable
.


However
,
Nietzsche
makes
another
argument
that
concerns
memory
and
has
to
do
with
the
idea
of
forgetfulness
.


“Only
something
which
continues
to
hurt
stays
in
the
memory
—
that
is
a
proposition
from
the
oldest
(and
unfortunately
the
longest-lived)
psychology
on
earth
.

”
(The
Nietzsche
Reader
,
On
the
Genealogy
of
Morality
:
A
Polemic
,
p410)
.


Often
in
punishing
individuals
,
the
psychology
behind
it
is
that
it
will
stay
in
the
memory
of
both
the
observer
and
the
subject
—
it
shall
prevent
the
individual
from
committing
a
crime
but
also
give
a
lesson
for
the
rest
of
society
that
they
will
be
punished
for
their
involvement
in
the
act
of
crime
.


However
,
this
is
not
what
Nietzsche
wants
to
bring
into
the
modern
world
.


Rather
,
he
dives
into
the
genealogy
of
justice
and
morality
practised
in
ancient
times
through
the
relationship
of
creditor
and
debtor
.


Thus
,
the
debtor
is
the
person
who
holds
‘guilt’
or
is
guilty
of
breaking
the
law
or
promise
.


The
debtor
should
repay
the
creditor
in
the
form
that
substitutes
the
debtor’s
benefits
.


It
can
be
extended
to
different
realms
of
society
.


For
instance
:
the
creditor
can
be
a
religious
,
king
or
a
rich
person
and
debtor
based
on
the
contract
he/she
has
must
repay
for
what
substitutes
for
the
sin
he/she
has
committed
.


This
can
be
money
,
food
,
freedom
or
the
debtor’s
body
(something
the
debtor
owns)
that
when
the
debtor
is
unable
to
pay
the
creditor
,
the
things
that
the
debtor
owns
will
substitute
instead
as
a
form
of
payment
.


However
,
Nietzsche
argues
in
case
when
the
debtor
puts
his
body
as
a
substitute
“in
particular
,
the
creditor
could
inflict
all
kinds
of
dishonour
and
torture
on
the
body
of
the
debtor
,
for
example
,
cutting
as
much
flesh
off
as
seemed
appropriate
for
the
debt
.

”
(The
Nietzsche
Reader
,
On
the
Genealogy
of
Morality
:
A
Polemic
,
p412)
.


This
could
result
in
the
death
of
the
debtor
.



Furthermore
,
the
relationship
between
creditor
and
debtor
is
the
primary
but
profound
legal
form
to
keep
the
order
within
a
community
.


Thus
,
it
evolved
over
time
and
changed
to
a
system
of
justice
in
which
criminals
are
punished
for
the
act
that
harmed
the
creditor
.


This
act
could
harm
the
creditor
and
the
community
the
debtor
belongs
to
as
a
whole
;
therefore
,
the
punishment
is
necessary
to
prevent
such
acts
in
the
future
from
other
community
members
.


In
contrast
,
Nietzsche
argues
that
“it
was
out
of
anger
over
some
wrong
which
had
been
suffered
,
directed
at
the
perpetrator
,
—
but
this
anger
was
held
in
check
and
modified
by
the
idea
that
every
injury
has
its
equivalent
which
can
be
paid
in
compensation
,
if
only
through
the
pain
of
the
person
who
injures”
(The
Nietzsche
Reader
,
On
the
Genealogy
of
Morality
:
A
Polemic
,
p412)
.


The
punishment
will
not
prevent
future
wrong
acts
,
but
it
expresses
that
every
wrong
act
has
a
price
,
and
in
a
system
of
justice
,
whether
ancient
or
modern
—
the
price
is
measured
according
to
the
time
,
age
,
duration
and
consequences
of
the
wrong
act
of
the
doer
.


The
punishment
marks
in
the
debtor’s
memory
,
and
through
pain
,
the
memory
lasts
for
quite
a
long
time
.


However
,
the
memory
of
the
pain
may
vanish
or
be
forgotten
at
a
certain
point
in
future
,
but
the
other
aspect
that
Nietzsche
touched
upon
briefly
is
the
humiliation
of
the
debtor
by
the
creditor
.


The
psychology
of
humiliation
extends
;
it
will
make
the
debtor
disappear
from
the
public
eyes
after
receiving
the
punishment
in
the
public
arena
.


For
example
,
the
extrajudicial
beating
,
denigrating
and
shaving
the
heads
of
thieves
in
public
spaces
by
the
Taliban
in
Afghanistan
as
seen
in
the
21st
century
where
they
not
only
punish
them
but
parade
the
criminals
on
the
streets
.


These
criminals
,
however
,
receive
physical
punishment
,
but
the
humiliation
in
the
public
spaces
will
have
exponential
psychological
consequences
both
for
the
public
observers
and
the
criminals
at
the
same
time
.



The
debtor’s
price
in
a
developing
country
is
higher
than
in
a
rich
country
.


Today
,
the
punishment
of
the
debtor
is
crueler
in
poorer
communities
around
the
world
.


However
,
it
is
profoundly
connected
with
the
amount
of
pleasure
the
creditor
receives
from
the
punishment
of
the
debtor
.


Because
,
some
of
the
rich
countries
,
too
,
participate
in
getting
pleasure
from
inflicting
pain
on
the
debtor
,
“to
make
someone
suffer
,
—
a
true
feast
,
something
which
,
as
I
mentioned
,
rose
in
price
the
more
it
contrasted
with
the
rank
and
social
position
of
the
creditor
.

”
(The
Nietzsche
Reader
,
On
the
Genealogy
of
Morality
:
A
Polemic
,
p413)
.


Because
the
creditor
feels
threatened
for
his
position
,
he
will
hold
the
law
in
his
hand
to
extract
as
much
pain
from
the
debtor
as
his
societal
position
allows
him
to
.


This
extraction
of
pain
is
pleasurable
for
the
creditor
;
it
is
not
a
direct
pleasure
but
a
pleasure
of
superiority
,
a
pleasure
in
which
the
creditor
feels
powerful
,
strong
and
in
a
position
of
authority
.


“Through
punishment
of
the
debtor
,
the
creditor
takes
part
in
the
rights
of
the
masters
:
at
last
he
,
too
,
shares
the
elevated
feeling
of
despising
and
maltreating
someone
as
an
‘inferior’
.

”
(The
Nietzsche
Reader
,
On
the
Genealogy
of
Morality
:
A
Polemic
,
p413)
.


This
also
becomes
problematic
as
the
creditor
extends
his
credits
to
those
who
will
most
probably
be
unable
to
repay
the
debts
,
and
it
is
;
therefore
,
the
creditor
will
enjoy
not
the
pleasure
of
punishing
the
debtor
but
enjoy
having
authority
and
power
.


Moreover
,
the
extension
of
the
credits
in
which
those
who
are
unable
to
repay
it
will
enable
the
creditors
to
enjoy
an
authority
position
.


Thus
,
the
notion
of
‘will
to
power’
expands
to
a
deeper
discussion
for
another
essay
.



Furthermore
,
the
relationship
between
creditor
and
debtor
has
another
crucial
element
,
and
it
deals
with
‘justice’
which
is
only
implemented
by
the
strong
or
the
creditor
.


Justice
is
a
term
linked
with
strength
,
power
and
authority
;
what
is
just
and
what
is
not
can
only
be
determined
by
the
strong
—
only
the
strong
dictates
justice
.


“Justice
at
this
first
level
is
the
goodwill
,
between
those
who
are
roughly
equal
,
to
come
to
terms
with
each
other
.

”
(The
Nietzsche
Reader
,
On
the
Genealogy
of
Morality
:
A
Polemic
,
p414)
Nietzsche
further
takes
the
discussion
of
justice
to
a
system
that
emerges
in
greater
human
civilisation
with
greater
populations
.


A
system
of
justice
is
called
the
‘court’
where
before
anything
ruling
on
the
punishment
of
the
debtor
,
the
court
is
the
place
where
the
debtor
is
found
guilty
of
not
repaying
the
creditor
,
or
the
creditor
who
is
strong
enough
can
show
mercy
and
forgives
the
debtor
.



“As
a
community
grows
in
power
,
it
ceases
to
take
the
offence
of
the
individual
quite
so
seriously
,
because
these
do
not
seem
to
be
as
dangerous
and
destabilising
for
the
survival
of
the
whole
as
they
did
earlier
:
the
wrong-doer
is
no
longer
‘deprived
of
peace’
and
cast
out
,
nor
can
the
general
public
vent
their
anger
on
him
with
the
same
lack
of
constraint
,
—
instead
the
wrong-doer
is
carefully
shielded
by
the
community
from
this
anger
,
especially
from
that
of
the
immediate
injured
party
,
and
given
protection
.

”
(The
Nietzsche
Reader
,
On
the
Genealogy
of
Morality
:
A
Polemic
,
p415)

In
another
part
,
Nietzsche
argues
that
“the
creditor
always
becomes
more
humane
as
his
wealth
increases
.

”
(The
Nietzsche
Reader
,
On
the
Genealogy
of
Morality
:
A
Polemic
,
p416)
With
the
increase
of
wealth
,
the
creditor
realises
that
the
time
spent
on
the
punishment
of
the
weak
or
the
debtor
is
merely
a
waste
of
time
—
a
time
so
precious
that
it
may
bring
more
wealth
.


Thus
,
the
creditor
often
suffices
with
minimum
punishment
without
the
intention
of
pleasure
or
a
sense
of
mastery
but
to
keep
the
debtor
in
check
.


For
instance
,
the
death
penalty
does
exist
in
most
authoritarian
regimes
,
the
execution
of
the
political
opposition
that
damages
the
regime
—
making
it
an
excuse
to
execute
any
political
opposition
.


On
the
other
hand
,
many
other
countries
give
the
death
penalty
only
to
sporadic
and
exceptional
cases
as
a
form
of
justice
for
the
victim
and
justice
for
the
perpetrator’s
guilt
.


However
,
there
are
other
exceptional
cases
in
which
the
victim
forgives
the
debtor
and
reduces
the
amount
of
suffering
that
debtor
may
face
.


One
can
also
argue
that
punishment
will
undo
the
wrong
act
committed
by
the
debtor
.


“The
self-sublimation
of
justice
:
we
know
what
a
nice
name
it
gives
itself
—
mercy
;
it
remains
,
of
course
,
the
prerogative
of
the
most
powerful
man
,
better
still
,
his
way
of
being
beyond
the
law
.

”
(The
Nietzsche
Reader
,
On
the
Genealogy
of
Morality
:
A
Polemic
,
p416)

On
the
contrary
,
most
people
may
be
confused
with
the
forms
of
justice
being
applied
in
different
realms
of
society
.


As
discussed
in
the
first
essay
of
the
Genealogy
of
Morals
by
Nietzsche
that
the
revolt
of
the
slave
morality
against
the
strong
is
out
of
resentment
and
jealousy
.


The
slave
morality
is
vengeful
,
yet
it
is
not
strong
physically
;
therefore
,
the
slave
morality
uses
religion
as
a
weapon
of
fear
to
control
and
take
revenge
from
the
strong
.


This
will
to
power
of
the
slave
morality
is
out
of
resentment
and
envy
.


Hence
,
when
the
slave
morality
is
in
power
,
its
justice
is
reactionary
.


Justice
must
not
come
from
a
resentful
person
.


It
is
not
justice
in
any
form
or
shape
but
revenge
.


The
law
,
order
,
and
justice
are
only
applied
to
the
reactionary
people
,
not
the
active
and
strong
.


If
the
revenge
of
the
reactionary
takes
the
shape
of
justice
,
it
is
without
a
doubt
that
it
breeds
more
reactionary
people
who
will
seek
revenge
for
the
cruelty
they
face
and
call
it
‘justice’
.



In
conclusion
,
this
essay
is
demonstrated
in
the
second
essay
of
the
Genealogy
of
Morals
by
Nietzsche
,
in
which
he
argues
that
making
a
promise
is
a
skill
that
only
humans
possess
,
this
ability
to
remember
what
is
owed
and
when
it
is
due
.


The
relationship
that
Nietzsche
talks
about
is
between
creditor
and
debtor
.


Thus
,
when
the
debtor
breaks
his
promise
,
this
broken
promise
is
the
origin
of
‘guilt’
for
Nietzsche
,
and
in
the
process
,
the
debtor
,
before
making
a
promise
,
must
substitute
something
in
the
case
if
he
is
unable
to
repay
the
debts
to
the
creditor
in
any
form
—
which
lead
us
to
the
notion
of
justice
and
how
justice
can
prevail
between
the
creditor
and
debtor
.


After
all
,
Nietzsche’s
interest
in
the
profundity
of
the
elements
of
justice
,
guilt
or
bad
conscience
describes
how
the
justice
system
worked
both
historically
and
psychologically
.


For
Nietzsche
,
it
is
not
only
important
to
think
about
the
origin
of
the
above-discussed
subjects
but
also
their
correlation
to
the
modern
world
—
the
two
opposing
poles
that
Nietzsche
elaborates
on
in
his
philosophy
.

Medieval
Theories
of
Conscience

First
published
Tue
Jan
19
,
2021

The
question
of
what
role
the
human
mind
plays
in
moral
behaviour—or
the
study
of
moral
psychology—has
been
a
fruitful
area
of
research
in
medieval
philosophy
since
at
least
the
early
to
mid-1990s
.


Since
then
scholars
have
done
much
to
illuminate
medieval
contributions
to
such
perennial
topics
as
the
freedom
of
the
will
,
the
problem
of
moral
weakness
,
and
what
role
,
if
any
,
the
emotions
and
the
moral
virtues
play
in
the
achievement
of
happiness
(e

,
Dumont
2000
,
Eardley
2006
,
Hoffmann
2007
,
and
Osborne
2014)
.


Similarly
,
metaethical
theories
about
the
foundations
of
morality
that
were
prominent
during
the
medieval
period
such
as
natural
law
theory—particularly
in
its
Thomistic
and
Scotistic
variants—continue
to
receive
robust
scholarly
attention
(e

Möhle
2003
,
Lisska

,
Sweeney

,
and
Cross

.


Comparatively
less
consideration
,
however
,
has
been
devoted
to
what
was
believed
to
link
the
psychological
to
the
metaethical
:
the
mental
habit
or
act
of
conscience
(and
its
sister-concept
of
synderesis)
,
though
interest
in
the
subject
has
recently
seen
a
modest
resurgence
(e
.

g
.


,
Hoffmann
2012
,
Eardley
2013
,
and
Dougherty
2018)
.



What
is
the
scope
and
nature
of
this
apparent
ability
to
intuitively
grasp
right
from
wrong
?


Can
conscience
err
and
,
if
so
,
do
its
dictates
still
bind
?


The
best
way
to
address
these
and
other
questions
is
to
employ
a
developmental
approach
.


The
term
conscience
is
still
generally
used
to
refer
to
an
innate
moral
sense
,
but
it
has
slightly
different
connotations
today
than
it
did
in
the
medieval
period
,
which
in
turn
had
different
connotations
from
what
preceded
it
in
pagan
antiquity
and
in
Scripture
.


Still
,
medieval
theories
of
conscience
drew
extensively
on
these
earlier
sources
.


Since
the
concepts
of
conscience
and
synderesis
evolved
over
time
,
then
,
it
will
be
necessary
to
take
a
linear
approach
to
the
topic
and
begin
with
some
background
.

Background
:
The
Pagan
and
Early-Christian
Context

1
The
Ancient
Context
:
Judicial
Conscience

To
understand
the
medieval
theory
of
conscience
,
it
is
essential
to
examine
its
etymology
.


Unlike
most
philosophical
categories
that
are
central
to
medieval
thought
,
the
concept
of
conscience
did
not
have
its
origins
in
Plato
or
Aristotle
(Potts
1982
:
687)
.


Rather
,
most
scholars
agree
,
it
originated
in
the
Greek
playwrights
of
the
fifth
century
BCE
(Sorabji
2014
:
12
,
15–18)
.


It
is
also
possible
to
find
its
use
elsewhere
in
Greek
literature
,
such
as
in
the
fragments
of
Democritus
(D’Arcy
1961
:
5)
.



The
English
word
“conscience”
is
derived
from
the
Latin
conscientia
.


Its
Greek
equivalent
is
syneidesis
.


Both
terms
connote
a
state
or
act
of
“sharing
knowledge
with
oneself”
(Sorabji
2014
:
12)
.


This
knowledge
is
privileged
and
involves
awareness
of
a
personal
moral
defect
.


The
notion
that
“I”
can
judge
“myself”
naturally
suggests
,
as
Sorabji
puts
it
,
a
sort
of
“split
personality”
.


That
is
,
it
suggests
that
I
can
at
once
be
both
the
judge
and
the
one
being
judged
,
particularly
with
respect
to
specific
,
past
actions
which
ordinarily
elicit
remorse
.


This
suggestion
is
rooted
in
the
quite
intuitive
idea
that
human
beings
are
reflexive
animals
:
beings
who
are
not
only
capable
of
turning
their
attention
to
objects
in
the
outside
world
but
can
also
“turn
back
on”
(reflectere)
or
become
an
object
to
themselves
.


As

Lewis
put
it
in
his
study
of
the
concept
of
concept
of
conscience
in
the
Western
tradition
:


Man
might
be
defined
as
a
reflexive
animal
.


A
person
cannot
help

thinking
and
speaking
of
himself
as
,
and
even
feeling
himself
to
be

(for
certain
purposes)
,
two
people
,
one
of
whom
can
act
upon
and

observe
the
other
.


Thus
,
he
pities
,
loves
,
admires
,
hates
,
despises
,

rebukes
,
comforts
,
examines
,
masters
or
is
mastered
by
,
“himself”
[…]

He
is
privy
to
his
own
acts
,
is
his
own
conscius
or
accomplice
.


And
of

course
,
this
shadowy
inner
accomplice
has
all
the
same
properties
as

an
external
one
;
he
too
is
a
witness
against
you
,
a
potential

blackmailer
,
one
who
inflicts
shame
and
fear
.


(Lewis
1960
:
187
;
see

also
Sorabji
2014
:
12)

Lewis
refers
to
this
primarily
pagan
understanding
of
conscience
as
an
“inner
witness”
.


It
does
not
judge
our
actions
as
right
or
wrong
,
but
merely
testifies
to
their
existence
:


It
bears
witness
to
the
facts
,
say
,
that
we
committed
a
murder
.


It

does
not
tell
us
that
murder
is
wrong
;
we
are
supposed
to
know
that
in

some
other
way
.


(Lewis
1960
:
190)

Others
,
however
,
regard
the
sort
of
conscience
that
Lewis
describes
here
as
a
type
of
internal
judge
,
and
therefore
refer
to
it
as
“judicial
conscience”
(D’Arcy
1961
:
8)
.


While
this
property
of
the
mind
does
not
necessarily
issue
binding
rules
,
it
does
pass
moral
judgements
on
our
deeds
.


It
would
,
however
,
eventually
take
on
the
role
of
issuing
moral
dictates
for
future
acts
as
well
.


Eric
D’Arcy
refers
to
this
later
form
of
syneidesis
or
conscientia
as
the
“legislative
conscience”
whose
innovator
,
he
argues
,
was
the
Apostle
Paul
(ca
.


5
CE–ca
.


64/67
CE)
,
the
most
important
founder
of
the
Christian
faith
after
Jesus
of
Nazareth
(D’Arcy
1961
:
8)
.

2
St
.


Paul
:
Legislative
Conscience

The
judicial
understanding
of
conscience
continued
well
into
the
first
century
of
the
Common
Era
.


To
be
sure
,
Paul
himself
continued
to
employ
it
.


At
the
same
time
,
D’Arcy
credited
Paul
with
introducing
,
in
addition
to
the
“judicial
conscience”
,
a
novel
conception
he
termed
the
“legislative
conscience”
.


It
is
not
difficult
to
see
why
the
earlier
judicial
conception
would
later
take
on
legislative
features
.


This
is
because
the
ability
to
judge
past
actions
as
either
right
or
wrong—and
to
issue
exhortations
on
that
basis—would
,
once
this
property
came
to
be
associated
with
the
moral
law
,
take
on
the
legislative
role
of
issuing
commands
.


Indeed
,
it
is
in
St
.


Paul
that
we
find
this
very
association
between
syneidesis
and
the
moral
law
:


[W]hen
Gentiles
,
who
do
not
have
the
law
,
do
by
nature
things
required

by
the
law
,
they
are
a
law
for
themselves
,
even
though
they
do
not

have
the
law
.


They
show
that
the
requirements
of
the
law
are
written

on
their
hearts
,
their
consciences
also
bearing
witness
,
and
their

thoughts
sometimes
accusing
them
and
at
other
times
even
defending

them
.


(Romans
2
:14–15
;
NIV)

Judging
by
this
passage
,
there
are
evidently
two
expressions
of
the
moral
law
according
to
Paul
:
The
Mosaic
Law
,
explicitly
handed
down
to
the
Jews
,
and
another
law
that
is
“written
on
[men’s]
hearts”
.


This
latter
was
later
glossed
as
a
reference
to
the
natural
law
,
which
is
accessible
to
all
people
,
non-Jews
included
,
and
is
consistent
with
the
Mosaic
Law
.


Notice
that
,
according
to
the
foregoing
passage
,
conscience
(syneidesis)
is
not
the
ultimate
source
of
right
and
wrong
.


Rather
,
the
foundation
of
right
and
wrong
is
the
objective
moral
law
,
which
is
both
“written
on
[men’s]
hearts”
and
borne
witness
to
by
conscience
.



One
might
say
,
then
,
that
the
objective
norm
of
morality
on
Paul’s
account
is
the
moral
law
(or
natural
law)
.


Conscience
,
however
,
might
be
termed
morality’s
subjective
norm
.


This
is
made
clear
in
another
passage
from
St
.


Paul
,
where
he
is
addressing
the
question
of
whether
it
is
permissible
for
Christians
to
eat
meat
that
was
previously
sacrificed
to
idols
.


Some
,
Paul
says
,
erroneously
think
that
to
eat
such
food
defiles
them
.


In
fact
,
since
the
pagan
idols
do
not
exist
,
eating
food
sacrificed
to
them
,
or
indeed
to
God
himself
,
is
morally
irrelevant
,
since
“food
does
not
bring
us
near
to
God—we
are
no
worse
if
we
do
not
eat
,
and
no
better
if
we
do”
(1
Corinthians
8
:8
;
NIV)
.


Still
,
even
though
the
consciences
of
such
Christians
are
erroneous
,
they
must
follow
them
since
conscience
,
Paul
suggests
,
is
a
rule
of
conduct
(Romans
14
:13–23)
.


Eric
D’Arcy
sums
up
these
two
important
contributions
of
St
.


Paul
as
follows
:


St
.


Paul
,
then
,
introduces
an
entirely
new
phase
in
the
history
of
the

term
“conscience”
in
moral
theory
,
and
two
new
features
characterize

his
use
of
it
.


First
,
it
is
to
play
a
directive
role
before
action

takes
place
.


In
the
pagan
writers
,
conscience
did
not
appear
on
the

scene
until
after
the
action
was
performed
,
and
its
role
was
purely

judicial
;
but
in
St
.


Paul
,
conscience
is
credited
with
a
legislative

function
,
and
it
induces
an
obligation
in
the
proper
sense
.


Second
,

conscience
is
fallible
:
the
directions
it
issues
may
be
mistaken
;
but

whether
it
be
mistaken
or
not
,
it
seems
that
we
are
bound
to
follow

its
rulings
.


(D’Arcy
1961
:
11–12)

In
sum
,
we
might
follow
Sorabji’s
suggestion
that
this
phase
in
the
development
of
the
concept
of
conscience—that
is
,
from
its
origins
in
fifth-century
BCE
Greek
literature
to
the
first-century
CE—has
eight
features
(Sorabji
2014
:
36)
.



1
.


It
involves
a
consciousness
of
the
self
rather
than
of
others
.


2
.


It
draws
on
values
to
which
one
feels
personally
committed
or
that

are
“not
necessarily
shared
by
others”
.


3
.


It
is
self-reflexive
insofar
as
it
suggests
a
“split
person”
:
an
“I”

that
has
secret
knowledge
which
it
shares
with
itself
.


4
.


Its
original
purpose
was
“retrospective”
or
judicial
,
although
it

later
incorporated
into
its
definition
a
“prospective”
or

legislative
function
.


5
.


Although
it
draws
on
general
moral
principles
,
it
is
chiefly

concerned
with
their
application
to
the
specific
circumstances
in

which
the
agent
finds
him
or
herself
.


6
.


It
began
as
a
secular
concept
.


7
.


In
the
Christian
tradition
it
is
regarded
as
susceptible
to
error
,

and
8
.


although
cognitive
in
character
,
it
possesses
motivating
or

affective
power
.

St

Jerome
:
The
Invention
of
Synderesis

That
conscience
was
so
central
a
concept
in
St
.


Paul’s
writings
guaranteed
it
an
important
place
in
the
moral
theology
of
the
Greek
and
Latin
Fathers
,
especially
St
.


Basil
,
John
Damascene
and
St
.


Ambrose
.


Amongst
these
early
writers
,
however
,
it
was
a
text
from
St
.


Jerome
that
was
particularly
consequential
since
it
introduced
into
the
debate
a
neologism
that
would
have
an
important
impact
in
the
later
Middle
Ages
:
the
concept
of
synderesis
.



In
the
course
of
commenting
on
Ezekiel
,
Jerome
had
tied
a
prophecy
mentioned
in
its
first
book
to
Plato’s
moral
psychology
(commentary
on
Ezekiel
1
.

7)
.


The
prophecy
in
question
consisted
of
a
vision
of
four
creatures
emerging
from
the
heavens
,
each
with
four
faces
:
those
of
a
man
,
a
lion
,
an
ox
and
an
eagle
(Ezekiel
1
:
4–14)
.


In
his
gloss
,
Jerome
noted
that
“most
people”
(plerique)
interpreted
this
vision
with
reference
to
Plato’s
tripartite
division
of
the
soul
in
the
Republic
:
the
human
face
representing
reason
,
the
lion’s
face
the
spirited
part
,
and
the
ox’s
face
the
appetitive
part
(cf
.


Plato
,
Republic
,
436b–441b)
.


What
did
the
eagle
represent
?


According
to
Jerome
,
it
represented
that
“spark
of
conscience”
(scintilla
conscientiae)
which
makes
us
aware
of
our
sinfulness
when
reason
,
spirit
or
desire
become
disordered
.


Medieval
manuscripts
refer
to
this
psychological
property
as
synderesis
(or
sometimes
synteresis)
:


Now
above
these
three
was
the
eagle
;
so
in
the
soul
,
they
say
,
above

the
other
three
elements
and
beyond
them
is
a
fourth
,
which
the
Greeks

call
synderesis
.


This
is
that
spark
of
conscience
which
was
not

quenched
even
in
the
heart
of
Cain
,
when
he
was
driven
out
of

paradise
.


This
it
is
that
which
makes
us
,
too
,
feel
our
sinfulness

when
we
are
overcome
by
evil
Desire
or
unbridled
Spirit
,
or
deceived

by
sham
Reason
.


It
is
natural
to
identify
synderesis
with
the
eagle
,

since
it
is
distinct
from
the
other
three
elements
and
corrects
them

when
they
err
[…]
However
,
we
also
see
that
this
conscience

(conscientia)
is
cast
down
in
some
people
,
who
have
neither
shame
nor

insight
regarding
their
offences
,
and
loses
its
place
[…]
.


(commentary

on
Ezekiel
1
.

7
;
D’Arcy
trans
.


1961
:
16–17)

Most
scholars
now
agree
that
the
neologism
“synderesis”
introduced
in
Jerome’s
commentary
is
simply
a
corruption
of
the
Greek
syneidesis
(Kries
2002
:
67)
.


Since
syneidesis
is
simply
the
Greek
equivalent
of
the
Latin
term
conscientia—a
fact
of
which
Jerome
would
certainly
have
been
aware—one
might
have
expected
Jerome
to
use
them
interchangeably
.


Surprisingly
,
however
,
Jerome
suggests
that
the
Latin
term
means
something
different
from
the
Greek
term
.


In
the
text
cited
above
,
he
quite
explicitly
states
that
regardless
of
how
morally
corrupt
its
possessor
becomes
,
synderesis
can
never
be
lost
.


A
few
lines
later
,
however
,
he
does
admit
the
existence
of
those
who
are
shameless
and
lacking
in
moral
insight
.


Such
people
are
oblivious
to
their
offenses
because
,
according
to
Jerome
,
their
conscience
(conscientia)
ceases
to
be
present
in
them
(“looses
its
place”)
.


If
synderesis
cannot
be
lost
,
but
conscience
can
,
then
it
seems
to
follow
that
they
are
separate
properties
of
the
soul
.


In
any
case
,
whatever
Jerome’s
intention
,
this
curious
passage
was
indirectly
handed
down
to
the
Middle
Ages
via
the
Sentences
of
Peter
Lombard
(1095–1160)
.

The
Early-Scholastic
Tradition

.

1
Peter
Lombard
:
The
Scholastic
Origins
of
the
Debate

Peter
Lombard’s
role
in
the
evolution
of
the
concept
of
conscience
is
both
surprising
and
unsurprising
.


It
is—at
first
sight
,
anyway—surprising
because
Lombard
does
not
discuss
conscience
or
synderesis
in
any
actual
detail
.


Indeed
,
he
does
not
,
strictly
speaking
,
mention
the
terms
“synderesis”
or
“conscience”
at
all
.


What
he
does
is
merely
to
allude
to
Jerome’s
commentary
on
Ezekiel
in
the
context
of
discussing
the
will’s
role
in
how
rational
agents
can
naturally
want
what
is
good
while
simultaneously
being
slaves
to
sin
(Peter
Lombard
,
Sententiae
in
IV
libros
distinctae
,
2
.

39
;
Potts
1980
:
92)
.


In
St
.


Paul’s
reference
to
moral
weakness
in
Romans
7
:15
,
he
famously
says
:
“For
I
do
not
do
what
I
want
but
do
what
I
do
not
want”
.


Is
Paul
suggesting
,
asks
Lombard
,
that
we
have
two
separate
wills
:
one
naturally
oriented
towards
the
good
and
another
oriented
towards
sin
?


Or
is
it
rather
the
case
that
we
have
a
single
will
that
,
although
naturally
inclined
to
the
good
,
contains
a
defect
which
also
“takes
pleasure
in
what
is
evil”
(Sententiae
in
IV
libros
distinctae
,
2
.

39
;
Potts
1980
:
93)
?


Amongst
those
who
hold
the
first
view
,
the
motivating
power
that
orients
us
towards
the
good
is
called
the
“natural”
will
,
while
the
inclination
towards
sin
resulting
from
the
Fall
is
called
“free
will”
(or
“free
choice”)
.


With
respect
to
the
former
,
Peter
writes
:


For
some
say
that
there
are
two
motivations
,
one
by
which
a
man

naturally
wants
what
is
good
.


Why
naturally
?


And
why
is
it
called

“natural”
?


Because
such
was
the
motivation
of
human
nature
in
its

original
state
,
in
which
we
were
created
without
any
defect
,
and
this

is
properly
called
“nature”
.


For
man
was
created
with
a
righteous
will

[…]
Man
is
therefore
rightly
said
naturally
to
want
what
is
good
,

because

was
constructed
with
a
good
and
righteous
will
.


For
the

higher
spark
of
reason
(superior
enim
scintilla
rationis)
which
,
as

Jerome
says
,
“could
not
even
be
extinguished
in
Cain”
,
always
wants

what
is
good
and
hates
what
is
bad
.

libros

Lombard’s
brief
mention
of
Jerome’s
“spark
of
reason”
(sic)
in
the
aforementioned
passage
is
the
full
extent
of
his
treatment
of
conscience
and
synderesis
.


Still
,
that
was
sufficient
to
ensure
that
it
would
receive
robust
attention
by
later
scholastics
,
who
would
track
down
the
original
text
from
Jerome
in
order
to
comment
on
it
.


A
compilation
of
theological
writings
taken
mainly
from
Scripture
and
the
Fathers
and
arranged
in
systematic
fashion
,
the
Sentences
had
an
enormous
impact
on
later
theological
enquiry
since
much
it
,
after
the
1220s
,
was
carried
out
within
the
taxonomy
that
Lombard
had
laid
out
in
his
work
.


Indeed
,
after
Alexander
of
Hales
(1185–1245)
adopted
the
Sentences
as
the
main
source
for
his
ordinary
lectures
at
Paris
in
1222
,
and
Richard
Fischacre
(1206–1248)
did
the
same
at
Oxford
in
1245
,
lecturing
on
the
Sentences
became
a
requirement
for
every
aspiring
master
of
theology
.


Thus
did
such
major
scholastics
of
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
centuries
as
Bonaventure
(1221–1274)
,
Thomas
Aquinas
(1224/25–1274)
,
John
Duns
Scotus
(1265–1308)
and
William
of
Ockham
(1287–1347)
come
to
write
their
important
commentaries
on
the
work
.


This
tradition
would
continue
well
into
the
sixteenth
century
.



Consisting
of
four
books
,
each
subdivided
into
chapters
,
the
Sentences
follows
the
distinction
that
Saint
Augustine
had
drawn
in
the
De
doctrina
Christiana
between
the
things
that
are
real
and
the
signs
that
lead
us
back
to
the
former
.


Book
one
treats
of
God
,
who
is
really
real
,
and
his
triune
nature
.


Book
two
deals
with
creation
and
the
fall
,
including
human
nature
,
treating
these
as
signs
that
point
back
to
God
.


Book
three
treats
of
Christ
,
who
is
the
antidote
to
the
fall
,
and
who
,
as
God
incarnate
,
is
both
thing
and
sign
.


Finally
,
book
four
treats
of
the
sacraments
,
which
are
signs
that
assist
the
fallen
in
their
return
to
God
:
the
ultimate
reality
.


Since
book
two
deals
with
human
moral
psychology
in
the
context
of
creation
and
the
fall
,
it
is
here
,
in
distinction
39
,
that
Peter
Lombard’s
mention
of
Jerome’s
commentary
on
Ezekiel
is
found
.



Since
Lombard’s
treatment
of
Jerome
was
partial
and
elliptical
,
later
thinkers
,
in
composing
their
commentaries
on
the
Sentences
,
naturally
turned
to
Jerome’s
text
in
order
to
scrutinize
the
original
passage
.


There
,
they
discovered
his
apparent
distinction
between
synderesis
and
conscience
,
which
in
turn
would
come
to
frame
the
parameters
of
the
later
medieval
debate
.


If
synderesis
and
conscience
are
in
fact
two
separate
parts
of
the
soul
,
for
instance
,
what
is
their
relationship
to
one
another
?


What
,
come
to
that
,
are
their
respective
natures
and
,
rather
importantly
,
can
they
become
disordered
?


Such
questions
would
preoccupy
the
theologians
of
the
later
Middle
Ages
.

Stephen
Langton
:
Synderesis
and
its
Properties

Stephen
Langton
(1155–1228)
,
regent
master
of
theology
at
Paris
and
later
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
is
important
in
the
present
context
less
for
any
systematic
treatment
of
conscience—indeed
Stephen
scarcely
touches
on
the
issue
at
all—than
for
his
somewhat
scattered
views
on
synderesis
.


The
relevant
treatment
comes
in
Stephen’s
Quaestiones
disputatae
of
1203–1205
in
the
context
of
his
discussion
on
free
decision
(liberum
arbitrium)
.



For
Stephen
,
there
are
three
powers
(vires)
of
the
soul
that
are
relevant
to
the
moral
life
:
the
concupiscible
appetite
,
reason
and
synderesis
.


The
concupiscible
appetite
draws
reason
towards
what
is
bad—specifically
towards
the
sin
of
sensuality—while
synderesis
attempts
to
sway
it
towards
the
good
.


It
is
reason’s
job
to
adjudicate
between
these
two
impulses
.


Freedom
of
decision
(libertas
arbitrii)
is
the
outcome
of
reason
directing
the
will
to
choose
in
accordance
with
either
the
promptings
of
sensuality
,
or
the
promptings
of
synderesis
(Stephen
Langton
,
Quaestiones
disputatae
;
Lottin
ed
.


Psychologie
et
morale
I
,
1942
:
61)
.



The
purpose
of
synderesis
,
then
,
is
to
direct
reason
away
from
vice
for
it
is
the
faculty
“by
which
a
person
naturally
detests
what
is
evil
and
is
a
part
of
the
rational
power”
(Quaestiones
disputatae
;
Lottin
ed
.


Psychology
et
morale
II
.

1
,
1948
:
112)
.


Can
such
a
power
be
extinguished
?


Yes
and
no
.


In
its
capacity
as
an
inclination
towards
the
good
,
which
is
accidental
to
it
,
synderesis
can
indeed
be
lost
in
the
damned
.


Essentially
speaking
,
however
,
the
purpose
of
synderesis
is
to
repudiate
what
is
wicked
.


In
this
sense
,
it
is
never
lost
,
even
in
the
damned
(Quaestiones
disputatae
;
Lottin
ed
.


1948
:
111)
.



Stephen
Langton’s
most
important
contribution
to
the
development
of
the
concept
of
synderesis
occurs
in
his
discussion
of
whether
synderesis
can
merit
or
demerit
.


In
the
process
of
discussing
this
issue
Stephen
links
synderesis
to
the
practical
syllogism
,
specifically
associating
it
with
the
grasp
of
general
principles
(Quaestiones
disputatae
;
Lottin
ed
.


1948
:
113)
.


D’Arcy
sums
up
Langton’s
position
as
follows
:


Remorse
of
conscience
is
the
work
,
not
of
synderesis
,
but
of
reason
,

for
synderesis
remains
at
the
level
of
general
principles
,
whereas

reason
descends
to
the
concrete
case
;
but
it
is
precisely
over
the

concrete
case
that
remorse
of
conscience
is
felt
;
hence
it
is
by

reason
,
and
not
by
synderesis
,
that
we
sin
.


(D’Arcy
1961
:
23–24)

Langton’s
association
of
synderesis
with
general
moral
principles
would
,
as
we
will
see
,
influence
later
thinkers
such
as
Aquinas
.

Philip
the
Chancellor
:
The
First
Systematic
Treatment
of
Synderesis
and
Conscience

Although
Stephen
Langton
was
the
first
scholastic
to
touch
on
the
issue
of
synderesis
in
any
depth
,
it
was
Philip
the
Chancellor
(ca
.


1170–1237)
who
wrote
the
first
treatise
devoted
to
exploring
the
relationship
between
synderesis
and
conscience
(Lottin
1948
:
139–157)
.


As
chancellor
of
Notre
Dame
,
Philip
had
the
right
to
grant
the
license
to
teach
in
the
theology
faculty
at
Paris
,
and
it
was
under
his
tenure
that
the
Dominicans
and
the
Franciscans
acquired
their
chairs
in
theology
:
two
for
the
former
,
and
one
for
the
latter
.


Although
primarily
an
administrator
,
Philip
was
also
a
trained
theologian
.


His
most
important
work
is
the
Summa
de
bono
,
which
includes
the
treatise
on
conscience
.



In
his
treatise
Philip
sets
out
to
answer
several
questions
related
to
the
ontological
status
of
synderesis
,
to
the
question
of
whether
anyone
can
sin
if
they
follow
synderesis
,
and
to
whether
it
can
ever
be
extinguished
.


As
to
the
ontological
status
of
synderesis
,
Philip
cites
Jerome’s
authoritative
suggestion
that
synderesis
is
a
faculty
or
power
of
the
soul
.


Recall
that
Jerome
had
posited
a
quadripartite
soul
:
one
that
is
composed
of
reason
,
spirit
,
desire
and
synderesis
.


Since
the
first
three
parts
of
the
soul
are
potentialities
and
synderesis
is
classified
alongside
these
,
it
seems
to
follow
that
it
too
must
be
a
faculty
or
power
of
the
soul
,
distinct
from
the
faculty
of
reason
.


Philip
cites
St
.


Paul
and
John
of
Damascus
as
corroborating
authorities
who
apparently
share
the
view
that
synderesis
is
a
faculty
of
the
soul
independent
of
the
others
(Philip
the
Chancellor
,
Summa
de
bono
:
Treatise
on
Conscience
;
Potts
trans
.


1980
:
95–96)
.



Against
the
claim
that
synderesis
is
a
power
of
the
soul
,
Philip
presents
arguments
for
the
view
that
it
is
,
on
the
contrary
,
a
moral
habit
.


On
this
view
,
synderesis
is
to
the
natural
will
what
choice
is
to
the
deliberative
will
:
a
disposition
that
regulates
the
rationally
appetitive
powers
.


But
while
choice
simply
regulates
the
deliberative
will
with
respect
to
the
contingent
good
,
or
means
towards
happiness
,
synderesis


is
a
disposition
arising
naturally
in
conjunction
with
that

potentiality
by
which
the
natural
will
is
directed
to
what
is
good

without
qualification
.


(Summa
de
bono
:
Treatise
on
Conscience
;
Potts

trans
.


1980
:
96)

Moreover
,
just
as
the
impulse
to
sin
is
distinct
from
the
soul
,
so
too
is
synderesis
.


But
whereas
the
former
inclines
the
agent
towards
evil
,
the
latter
inclines
him
towards
goodness
.



Is
synderesis
,
then
,
a
power
of
the
soul
or
a
habit
?


This
distinction
goes
back
to
Aristotle
,
for
whom
powers
are
innate
and
associated
with
specific
capacities
,
while
habits
are
acquired
and
associated
,
by
contrast
,
with
tendencies
to
behave
in
certain
ways
.


Habits
,
moreover
,
inhere
in
powers
.


Although
both
of
these
properties
dispose
the
agent
to
act
in
particular
ways
,
powers
,
in
contrast
to
habits
,
are
linked
to
the
ability
to
do
so
contingently
.


If
I
am
in
the
habit
of
speaking
Russian
,
for
instance
,
then
I
will
have
the
tendency
to
do
so
on
a
regular
basis
.


It
is
my
preferred
mode
of
communication
,
and
I
will
take
every
opportunity
to
express
myself
in
that
language
.


That
I
may
have
the
mere
capacity—or
power—to
speak
Russian
,
on
the
other
hand
,
having
studied
it
in
school
,
say
,
in
no
way
ensures
that
I
will
do
so
even
in
situations
where
I
probably
should
.


I
might
,
for
example
,
hate
and
resent
speaking
Russian
for
various
reasons
,
and
therefore
freely
refuse
to
do
so
under
any
circumstances
(see
,
e
.

g
.


,
Aristotle
,
Metaphysics
9
.

2
,
and
Potts
1980
:
20–22)
.



Although
Philip
seems
to
favour
the
belief
that
synderesis
is
a
habit
,
the
claim
that
it
is
a
power
of
the
soul
has
the
rather
weighty
authority
of
St
.


Paul
and
St
.


Jerome
.


Philip
therefore
splits
the
difference
,
as
it
were
,
and
argues
that
it
is
a
“habit-like
power”
or
“dispositional
potentiality”
(habitualis
potentiae)—a
faculty
of
the
soul
that
disposes
its
possessor
towards
choosing
the
unqualified
good—though
one
that
is
innate
rather
than
acquired
through
habituation
:


Synderesis
,
although
the
morphology
of
its
name
makes
it
sound
more

like
a
disposition
than
a
potentiality
,
is
nevertheless
the
name
of
a

dispositional
potentiality
:
I
do
not
say
of
an
acquired
disposition
,

but
of
an
innate
one
.


And
thus
,
qua
disposition
it
can
be
applied
to

what
is
related
to
it
as
a
disposition
,
qua
potentiality
to
what
is

related
to
it
as
a
potentiality
.


From
this
it
follows
that
it
has
a

certain
opposition
to
free
choice
,
a
certain
opposition
to
the
impulse

[to
sin]
and
sensuality
,
and
a
certain
opposition
to
proheresis
,
which

is
part
of
free
choice
:
qua
potentiality
,
it
is
disparate
from
free

choice
and
from
sensuality
,
qua
disposition
it
is
disparate
from

proheresis
and
the
impulse
[to
sin]…So
,
if
anyone
asks
whether
it
is
a

potentiality
or
a
disposition
,
the
right
answer
lies
in
taking

something
in
between
:
a
dispositional
potentiality
.


(Summa
de
bono
:

Treatise
on
Conscience
;
Potts
trans
.


1980
:
97)

It
would
seem
,
then
,
that
synderesis
is
a
potentiality
,
albeit
an
unusual
one
.


Is
it
connected
to
the
cognitive
side
of
the
soul
or
to
the
appetitive
?


According
to
Philip
,
it
is
related
to
the
appetitive
,
and
specifically
to
the
rational
appetite
,
that
is
,
to
the
will
,
rather
than
to
the
sense
appetite
.


However
,
as
we
saw
,
Philip
divides
the
rational
appetite
into
what
he
calls
“natural
will”
and
“deliberative
will”
.


The
natural
will
signifies
the
general
inclination
that
humans
have
to
the
good
or
happiness
as
such
.


Such
an
object
is
beyond
the
scope
of
choice
.


Having
said
that
,
happiness
can
be
achieved
in
any
number
of
ways
and
by
the
acquisition
of
any
number
of
legitimate
,
though
contingent
goods
.


Indeed
,
it
is
fair
to
say
that
rational
agents
never
choose
happiness
as
such
,
given
that
it
is
a
mere
abstraction
.


Rather
,
what
they
choose
are
particular
goods
which
,
taken
together
,
comprise
the
good
life
if
pursued
in
an
orderly
way
.


Such
contingent
goods
are
the
means
to
happiness
and
are
the
objects
of
the
deliberative
will
,
and
therefore
choice
.


Synderesis
,
according
to
Philip
,
pertains
to
the
natural
will
.


It
is
the
remnant
of
original
rectitude
or
justice
which
,
although
damaged
during
the
fall
,
remains
in
the
soul
in
diminished
form
.


As
Philip
puts
it
,
synderesis
is
that
which
“murmurs
back
against
sin
and
correctly
contemplates
and
wants
what
is
good
without
qualification”
(Summa
de
bono
:
Treatise
on
Conscience
;
Potts
trans
.


1980
:
100)
.



On
the
matter
of
conscience
and
how
it
is
related
to
synderesis
,
Philip
distinguishes
them
.


For
one
thing
,
conscience
can
be
mistaken
while
synderesis
cannot
.


Specifically
,
conscience
is
the
result
of
a
concurrence
of
synderesis
with
free
decision
(liberum
arbitrium)
.


Put
otherwise
,
it
is
the
specific
application
of
a
general
moral
principle
that
is
the
outcome
of
deliberation
.


When
correctly
applied
,
conscience
is
correct
.


When
incorrectly
applied
,
it
errs
.


In
either
case
,
the
judgement
of
conscience
generates
a
moral
obligation
to
act
.


Philip
uses
the
following
example
of
how
synderesis
,
which
is
always
right
,
can
nonetheless
conjoin
with
an
erring
conscience
(Potts
1980
:
104)
:

1
.


Unerring
universal
premise
of
synderesis
:
“Everyone
who
falsely

claims
to
be
the
Son
of
God
should
be
put
to
death”
.


2
.


Erring
minor
premise
of
reason
:
“This
Christ
fellow
is
falsely

claiming
to
be
the
Son
of
God”
.


3
.


Erring
judgement
of
conscience
:
“Therefore
this
Christ
fellow
should

be
put
to
death”

From
the
foregoing
example
,
it
is
clear
that
synderesis
delivers
a
general
,
non-deliberative
proposition
,
while
conscience
yields
what
Potts
calls
a
particular
,
“deontic
proposition”
:


Philip’s
argument
is
[…]
that
we
need
to
distinguish
between
general

and
particular
propositions
which
are
of
the
form
:
“A
ought
to
φ”

where
the
proper
name
of
any
person
may
be
substituted
for
“A”
and
any

verb-phrase
containing
a
verb
of
action
for
“φ”
(I
shall
henceforth

call
these
“deontic
propositions”)
.

correct
(by

the

Bonaventure
:
Conscience
as
Cognitive/Synderesis
as
Affective

One
of
the
most
prominent
representatives
of
the
Franciscan
intellectual
tradition
,
Bonaventure
(1217–1274)
lectured
on
the
Sentences
at
Paris
from
1250
until
1252
,
when
he
became
regent
master
in
the
theology
faculty
,
a
position
he
held
until
1257
.


His
commentary
on
the
Sentences
is
the
fruit
of
these
lectures
,
and
it
is
in
this
work
that
he
discusses
the
topics
of
conscience
and
synderesis
.


For
Bonaventure
we
not
only
possess
innate
moral
knowledge
,
but
we
also
have
an
inextinguishable
inclination
towards
achieving
the
good
.


Our
inborn
knowledge
of
the
former
,
that
is
,
of
the
natural
law
,
is
associated
with
conscience
,
which
resides
in
the
intellect
,
while
our
inclination
towards
desiring
the
good
is
associated
with
synderesis
,
which
inheres
in
the
will
.



What
is
the
ontological
status
of
conscience
?


According
to
Bonaventure
,
just
as
theologians
have
disagreed
over
the
nature
of
“thought”
,
defining
it
variously
as
the
power
of
thinking
,
a
habit
or
an
apprehended
principle
of
knowledge
,
so
too
have
they
differed
over
how
to
define
“conscience”
(conscientia)
.


Most
commonly
,
however
,
the
term
has
been
used
to
refer
to
a
cognitive
habit
or
disposition
that
relates
to
the
practical
as
opposed
to
the
theoretical
intellect
.


Indeed
,
it
is
the
disposition
that
perfects
the
practical
intellect
.


How
so
?


Through
its
consciousness
of
the
principles
that
comprise
the
natural
law—such
as
that
“God
is
to
be
honoured”—and
through
the
issuing
of
such
injunctions
to
the
will
.


As
Bonaventure
puts
it
:


theoretical
knowledge
perfects
our
thought
to
the
extent
that
the

latter
is
theoretical
,
whereas
conscience
is
a
disposition
perfecting

our
thought
to
the
extent
that
it
is
practical
,
or
to
the
extent
that

it
directs
us
towards
deeds
.

Is
such
a
disposition
innate
or
acquired
?


It
is
possible
,
according
to
Bonaventure
,
to
find
authorities
on
both
sides
of
the
debate
.


For
the
opinion
that
conscience
is
innate
,
Bonaventure
cites
,
among
other
authorities
,
St
.


Paul’s
famous
reference
to
a
moral
law
that
is
“written
on
[men’s]
hearts”
in
Romans
1
:14–15
.


He
also
appeals
to
a
“natural
instinct
to
seek
blessedness
and
[to]
honor
[one’s]
parents”
(commentary

;

.


For
the
opinion
that
conscience
is
not
innate
,
on
the
other
hand
,
Bonaventure
cites
Aristotle’s
claim
that
the
soul
is
a
blank
slate
.


Bonaventure’s
solution
is
to
find
a
middle
position
between
St
.


Paul
,
on
the
one
hand
,
and
Aristotle
,
on
the
other
.


His
conclusion
:
conscience
is
part
innate
,
part
acquired
.



In
what
sense
is
it
innate
?


Just
as
rational
creatures
have
a
natural
capacity
to
judge
the
veracity
of
first
principles
in
the
realm
of
speculative
reason
,
so
we
have
an
innate
capacity
to
judge
the
first
principles
of
practical
reason
.


This
innate
capacity
to
immediately
grasp
such
principles
as
true
or
not
in
the
realm
of
practical
reason
is
called
conscience
.


It
is
associated
,
for
Bonaventure
,
with
the
Augustinian
“natural
light”—or
“natural
tribunal”—that
is
built
into
the
structure
of
the
mind
and
which
permits
rational
agents
to
intuitively
grasp
the
basic
principles
of
the
natural
law
(see

Augustine
,
City
of
God
,
11
.

27
,
Bettenson
trans
.


1972
:
461–462)
.


Just
as
the
mind
is
disposed
to
grasp
,
in
the
realm
of
theoretical
reason
,
the
axiomatic
nature
of
such
propositions
as
that
“all
bachelors
are
unmarried
males”
,
so
too
it
has
a
innate
disposition
to
grasp
as
self-evidently
true
such
basic
principles
in
the
domain
of
practical
reason
as
“Honour
thy
father
and
mother”
and
“Do
not
harm
thy
neighbour”
.



In
what
sense
,
though
,
is
conscience
acquired
?


Although
the
ability
to
judge
the
deontic
propositions
of
the
natural
law
as
self-evidently
true
is
innate
,
it
does
not
follow
that
the
contents
of
such
propositions
are
innate
.


It
does
not
follow
,
that
is
,
that
the
concepts
“father”
and
“mother”
in
the
precept
to
honor
one’s
parents
are
in
the
mind
from
birth
.


And
indeed
,
so
Bonaventure
thinks
,
they
are
not
.


Rather
,
they
are
species
or
likenesses
acquired
through
sense
experience
which
,
once
acquired
,
form
the
terms
of
the
universal
propositions
of
the
natural
law
that
are
intuitively
grasped
.


In
this
sense
,
Bonaventure
is
true
to
Aristotle
:


For
everyone
agrees
that
there
is
an
imparted
light
of
the

apprehensory
potentiality
which
is
called
a
natural
tribunal
,
but
we

acquire
forms
and
likenesses
of
things
by
means
of
the
senses
,
as

Aristotle
says
explicitly
in
many
places
,
and
as
experience
also

teaches
us
.

Conscience
,
then
,
is
partly
innate
and
partly
acquired
with
respect
to
the
content
of
the
natural
law
.


But
what
is
the
relationship
of
such
universal
premises
to
the
conclusions
of
practical
reason
?


How
does
the
agent
proceed
from
a
general
knowledge
of
right
and
wrong
to
the
application
of
this
knowledge
to
concrete
situations
?


After
all
,
such
universal
premises
are
only
useful
to
the
extent
that
they
can
be
applied
.


For
Bonaventure
,
the
habit
of
directing
the
agent
toward
applying
the
general
principles
of
the
natural
law
to
specific
actions
,
like
the
habit
of
immediately
grasping
deontic
principles
,
is
innate
.


But
in
order
to
apply
this
self-evident
knowledge
we
must
acquire
further
knowledge
.


For
example
,
although
we
grasp
a
priori
the
truth
that
one
should
honor
one’s
father
and
mother
,
we
have
no
innate
knowledge
that
John
and
Mary
are
our
parents
and
that
it
is
they
specifically
who
must
be
honoured
as
opposed
to
,
say
,
Michael
and
Jane
.


Rather
,
this
type
of
knowledge
is
derived
from
experience
and
instruction
.



Note
that
conscience
does
not
simply
move
from
the
general
to
the
particular
with
respect
to
concrete
actions
.


It
also
moves
from
the
general
to
the
specific
with
respect
to
propositions
themselves
.


As
Potts
points
out
,
there
are
in
fact
two
classes
of
deontic
propositions
:
basic
and
derived
(Potts
1982
:
698)
.


Consider
the
deontic
proposition
to
obey
God
,
which
is
basic
,
or
maximally
evident
.


Obviously
,
other
more
specific
precepts
can
be
derived
from
this
very
general
one
.


Historically
,
for
instance
,
from
the
basic
deontic
proposition
to
obey
God
the
Jews
derived
the
further
,
less
evident
but
more
specific
deontic
propositions
to
refrain
from
eating
pork
and
to
circumcise
their
sons
.


How
did
they
come
to
know
these
more
specific
propositions
?


By
means
of
a
revealed
commandment—via
(divine)
instruction
,
in
other
words
(commentary

.


Although
the
distinction
between
basic
and
derived
deontic
propositions
is
Potts’
,
and
although
the
case
cited
is
an
example
of
an
erroneous
conscience
(Bonaventure
argues
that
male
circumcision
and
the
prohibition
on
eating
pork
are
no
longer
applicable)
,
it
accurately
sums
up
Bonaventure’s
distinction
between
propositions
that
are
“very
clearly
evident”
versus
those
that
are
“less
evident”
:


Just
as
some
things
that
are
cognizable
are
very
clearly
evident
,
such

as
axioms
and
first
principles
,
while
some
are
less
evident
,
such
as

particular
conclusions
,
so
also
in
things
that
can
be
done
,
some
are

evident
in
the
highest
degree
,
for
example
,
“Do
not
do
to
another
what

you
do
not
want
done
to
you”
and
that
one
should
submit
to
God
and

suchlike
.


In
the
same
way
,
then
,
as
the
cognition
of
first
principles

is
said
to
be
innate
in
us
by
reason
of
that
light
,
because
(due
to

their
self-evidence)
that
light
suffices
for
cognizing
them
(after
the

reception
of
species)
without
any
additional
persuasion
,
so
also
the

cognition
of
moral
first
principles
is
innate
in
us
,
in
that
that

judicatory
suffices
for
cognizing
them
.


Again
,
in
the
same
way
as

cognition
of
the
particular
conclusions
of
the
sciences
is
acquired
,

because
the
light
innate
in
us
does
not
fully
suffice
for
knowing

them
,
but
some
persuasion
and
fuller
acquaintance
are
needed
,
so
on

the
side
of
things
that
can
be
done
we
must
understand
,
similarly
,

that
we
are
bound
to
do
some
things
which
we
know
only
through

additional
instruction
.

This
distinction
between
basic
,
or
very
general
principles
,
and
specific
or
derived
precepts
is
germane
to
the
question
of
whether
conscience
can
ever
be
mistaken
and
,
if
so
,
whether
in
such
cases
it
continues
to
bind
.


Bonaventure’s
response
is
that
we
can
never
be
mistaken
about
basic
deontic
propositions
.


Rather
,
it
is
with
respect
to
derived
ones
that
we
sometimes
err
since


although
conscience
is
always
right
so
long
as
it
sticks
to
the

general
and
is
moved
by
simple
inspection
,
it
can
become
mistaken
when

it
descends
to
particulars
and
brings
things
together
,
because
the

actualisation
of
deliberative
reason
is
mixed
with
it
.

Is
one
obliged
to
always
follow
one’s
conscience
?


It
depends
,
since
conscience
is
fallible
.


If
what
it
dictates
is
in
accordance
with
God’s
will
,
then
one
is
obliged
to
follow
it
on
pain
of
eternal
damnation
.


If
erroneous—if
what
it
dictates
is
contrary
to
the
divine
will—as
is
sometimes
the
case
when
applying
basic
deontological
principles
,
then
conscience
does
not
bind
.


Rather
,
the
agent
has
an
obligation
to
correct
the
error
in
order
to
bring
his
conscience
into
line
with
the
natural
law
.


If
he
does
not
,
and
follows
his
erroneous
conscience
,
he
commits
a
mortal
sin
.


“It

Obviously

the

Does
it
not
have
an
equally
important
role
to
play
in
the
moral
life
?


Yes
:
in
its
possession
of
synderesis
.


In
line
with
tradition
,
Bonaventure
calls
synderesis
the
“spark
of
conscience”
(commentary

He
breaks
with
tradition
,
however
,
in
arguing
that
it
inheres
in
the
will
rather
than
in
the
intellect
.


Indeed
synderesis
,
for
Bonaventure
,
is
precisely
the
counterpart
of
conscience
insofar
as
the
will
,
like
the
intellect
,
has
an
innate
inclination
towards
the
moral
(as
opposed
to
the
useful)
good
.


In
the
case
of
the
intellect
this
disposition
takes
the
form
of
the
“natural
light”
of
conscience
that
apprehends
the
first
principles
of
the
natural
law
;
in
the
case
of
the
will
,
it
takes
the
form
of
synderesis
:
a
“natural
bias”
towards
desiring
the
moral
good
.


There
is
one
sense
,
however
,
in
which
synderesis
is
not
exactly
analogous
to
conscience
.


While
it
looks
very
much
like
a
habit
,
synderesis
is
rather
,
according
to
Bonaventure
(presumably
following
Philip
the
Chancellor)
,
a
habit-like
power
of
the
soul
(commentary

Can
synderesis
ever
be
extinguished
?


No
:
it
is
an
innate
orientation
towards
goodness
that
cannot
be
completely
eradicated
,
ontologically
speaking
,
even
in
the
most
vicious
of
people
.


In
its
exercise
,
however
,
it
can
become
impeded
“either
by
the
darkness
of
blindness
,
or
by
the
wantonness
of
pleasure
,
or
by
the
hardness
of
obstinacy”

.


In
such
cases
,
synderesis
ceases
to
“murmur”
against
evil
or
“goad”
towards
the
good
,
either
because
the
agent
is
blinded
by
ignorance
,
distracted
by
physical
pleasure
or
is
so
stubbornly
persistent
in
their
depravity
that
they
cannot
reorient
themselves
towards
the
good
.


Still
,
when
synderesis
follows
the
innate
judgement
of
conscience
with
respect
to
basic
deontic
principles
,
which
can
never
err
,
then
it
too
functions
correctly
because
that
is
its
natural
state
.


It
has
the
potential
to
go
wrong
and
fall
into
sin
only
during
the
exercise
of
deliberation
with

particular
truths
since
it
is
here
that
reason
can
become
faulty
and
the

free

disordered

When
reason
and
will
malfunction
synderesis
is
“overthrown
,
in
that

its
government
over

St
Thomas
Aquinas
:
Synderesis
and
Conscience
as
Cognitive

Thomas
Aquinas
(1224/25–1274)
is
,
by
any
measure
,
one
of
the
most
important
,
if
not
the
most
important
,
scholastic
theologian
of
the
later
Middle
Ages
.


Although
his
views
on
conscience
and
synderesis
have
received
less
attention
in
recent
years
than
his
theory
of
natural
law
,
this
is
unjustified
.


For
the
scholastics
,
a
full
account
of
morality
includes
not
only
an
explanation
of
how
practical
norms
are
grounded
,
but
also
an
understanding
of
how
they
are
grasped
and
how
it
is
that
rational
agents
,
despite
possessing
an
infallible
guide
to
such
knowledge
,
often
fail
to
apply
it
.


One’s
metaethics
,
in
other
words
,
is
inextricably
linked
to
one’s
moral
psychology
,
which
is
to
say
,
to
one’s
understanding
of
how
the
will
and
the
intellect
interact
with
one’s
knowledge
of
right
and
wrong
.



Aquinas
discussed
the
issues
of
synderesis
and
conscience
in
several
of
his
major
works
,
from
his
early
commentary
on
the
Sentences
and
the
De
veritate
to
his
mature
Summa
theologica
(see
D’Arcy
1961
:
36–47)
.


As
might
be
expected
,
his
account
is
very
different
from
that
of
his
Franciscan
contemporary
Bonaventure
.


For
one
thing
,
Bonaventure
assigns
synderesis
to
the
will
.


He
also
describes
it
,
as
we
saw
above
,
as
a
“habit-like
faculty”
.


Aquinas
,
as
might
be
expected
,
hews
much
closer
to
his
Dominican
mentor
and
teacher
Albert
the
Great
(ca
.


1200–1280)
for
whom
both
synderesis
and
conscience
belong
to
the
intellect
(see
Dougherty
2018
:
221)
.



For
Aquinas
,
the
rational
part
of
the
soul
comprises
the
faculties
or
powers
of
intellect
and
will
.


The
object
of
the
will
is
the
good
,
and
the
object
of
the
intellect
is
the
true
.


The
latter
potency
is
further
divided
into
the
speculative
intellect
(intellectus
speculativus)
and
the
practical
intellect
(intellectus
practicus)
.


How
do
these
differ
?


The
object
of
the
speculative
intellect
is
truth
as
such
,
while
the
object
of
the
practical
intellect
is
the
good
“under
the
aspect
of
truth”
(Thomas
Aquinas
,
Summa
theologica
I
,
q
.


79
,
a
.

,
ad
.

.


Synderesis
and
conscience
,
for
Aquinas
,
both
belong
to
the
practical
intellect
.



All
reasoning
must
start
from
immediately
evident
principles
if
an
infinite
regress
is
to
be
avoided
.


This
is
as
true
in
the
realm
of
practical
reason
as
it
is
in
the
realm
of
speculative
reason
.


Once
such
principles
have
been
grasped
and
assented
to
,
more
specific
conclusions
can
be
deduced
.


How
are
these
principles
grasped
?


In
the
domain
of
speculative
reason
,
they
are
apprehended
by
the
innate
disposition
that
Aquinas
calls
intellectus—“intuitive
reason”
or
“understanding”—and
that
Aristotle
called
nous
.


The
objects
of
this
habit
are
such
self-evident
propositions
as
that
“every
whole
is
greater
than
its
part”
and
that
“things
equal
to
one
and
the
same
are
equal
to
one
another”
(Summa
theologica
I-II
,
q
94
,
a
.


2
,
corp
.

)
.


Once
their
terms
are
known
,
the
intellect
immediately
grasps
the
truth
of
such
propositions
since
they
are
analytic
in
nature
.


The
corresponding
habit
in
the
domain
of
practical
reason
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
synderesis
:
a
property
of
the
soul
which
can
never
be
lost
,
which
never
errs
,
and
whose
objects
are
the
first
principles
of
the
natural
law
(De
veritate
16
.

1
,
corp
.

)
.


A
good
description
of
how
Aquinas
understands
synderesis
is
Hoffmann’s
,
who
calls
it
an
“infallible
moral
awareness”
(Hoffmann
2012
:
255)
.


Like
understanding
,
synderesis
is
innate
:


Wherefore
the
first
practical
principles
,
bestowed
on
us
by
nature
,
do

not
belong
to
a
special
power
,
but
to
a
special
natural
habit
,
which

we
call
“synderesis”
.


Whence
“synderesis”
is
said
to
incite
to
good
,

and
to
murmur
at
evil
,
inasmuch
as
through
first
principles
we
proceed

to
discover
,
and
judge
of
what
we
have
discovered
.


It
is
therefore

clear
that
“synderesis”
is
not
a
power
,
but
a
natural
habit
.


(Summa

theologica
I
,
q
.


79
,
a
.


12
,
corp
.

)

In
broad
terms
,
synderesis
is
a
link
between
the
human
intellect
and
the
divine
wisdom
.


The
universe
is
created
and
governed
by
a
providential
God
and
is
therefore
subject
to
the
order
of
final
causality
.


Accordingly
,
all
things
,
rational
and
non-rational
alike
,
seek
their
proper
ends
.


Non-rational
beings
,
since
they
lack
will
and
intellect
and
are
therefore
incapable
of
prudential
reasoning
,
achieve
their
ends
through
the
natural
inclinations
that
are
implanted
in
them
by
God
.


In
this
sense
,
they
participate
in
the
providential
plan
for
all
creation
that
Aquinas
calls
the
“eternal
law”
:
the
divine
wisdom
insofar
as
it
directs
all
creatures
towards
their
ends
(Summa
theologica
I-II
,
q
.


93
,
a
.


1
,
corp
.

)
.


They
do
so
,
however
,
in
a
diminished
way
.


Rational
beings
,
by
contrast
,
participate
in
divine
providence
in
a
more
excellent
way
.


This
participation
in
the
eternal
law
is
called
the
natural
law
,
whose
moral
principles
function
to
direct
human
beings
toward
their
ultimate
end
:
happiness
(Summa
theologica
,
I-II
,
q
.


91
,
a
.


2
,
corp
.

)
.


These
moral
principles
,
which
are
grasped
and
accordingly
possessed
by
synderesis
,
offer
an
insight
into
God’s
intentions
for
human
beings
and
therefore
into
the
ultimate
purpose
of
human
life
.


As
Baylor
writes
of
Aquinas’s
theory
:


Moral
principles
are
based
upon
and
derived
from
a
rationality
that
is

present
in
reality
;
they
are
a
human
knowledge
of
the
exemplary
ideas

in
the
divine
mind
according
to
which
creation
is
imbued
with
a

rational
order
.


(Baylor
1977
:
46)

Practical
reasoning
,
then
,
plays
a
central
role
in
the
achievement
of
happiness
,
the
final
end
for
humans
,
and
therefore
in
God’s
plan
for
us
.


Like
speculative
reasoning
,
practical
reasoning
generally
takes
a
deductive
form
.


Just
as
science
is
the
conclusion
of
the
demonstrative
syllogism
,
so
conscience
is
the
conclusion
of
a
practical
syllogism
.


The
practical
syllogism
,
like
the
demonstrative
syllogism
,
contains
a
major
premise
,
a
minor
premise
and
a
conclusion
.


The
major
premise
is
drawn
or
deduced
from
synderesis
.


The
minor
premise
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
drawn
either
from
faith
,
natural
reason
or
human
positive
law
.


From
the
major
and
minor
premises
,
a
conclusion
is
drawn
that
generates
a
moral
obligation
to
act
(Hoffmann
2012
:
258)
.


This
inferential
judgment
is
associated
,
for
Aquinas
,
with
conscience
:
an
act—as
opposed
to
a
faculty
or
a
habit—that
includes
a
number
of
applications
,
such
as
“to
witness
,
to
bind
,
or
incite
,
and
also
to
accuse
,
torment
,
or
rebuke”
(Thomas
Aquinas
,
Summa
theologica
I
,
q
.


79
,
a
.


13
,
corp
.

)
.



Conscience
acts
as
a
“witness”
when
it
is
consciously
aware
of
some
personal
wrongdoing
,
whether
of
commission
or
omission
.


It
“binds”
or
“incites”
when
it
makes
a
judgement
that
some
act
should
be
performed
.


Finally
,
it
“accuses”
,
“torments”
or
“rebukes”
when
it
judges
that
some
past
action
was
either
morally
acceptable
or
it
was
not
.


Although
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
conscience
in
the
first
sense—conscience
as
witness—can
function
as
an
application
of
knowledge
to
conduct
,
this
seems
less
problematic
in
the
second
and
third
senses
of
the
term
,
which
harken
back
to
the
legislative
and
judicial
senses
of
conscience
found
in
St
.


Paul
and
pagan
antiquity
,
respectively
(D’Arcy
1961
:
46)
.


In
any
case
,
an
example
of
the
way
in
which
conscience
applies
the
natural
law—whose
principles
are
apprehended
by
synderesis—
is
articulated
in
Aquinas’s
De
veritate
:


If
the
judgement
of
synderesis
expresses
the
statement
:
“nothing

prohibited
by
the
law
of
God
is
to
be
done”
,
and
if
the
knowledge
of

higher
reason
presents
this
minor
premise
“sexual
intercourse
with

this
woman
is
forbidden
by
the
law
of
God”
,
the
application
of

conscience
will
be
made
by
concluding
:
“this
sexual
intercourse
is
to

be
avoided”
.


(De
veritate
,
q
.


17
,
a
.


2
,
corp
.


;
cited
in
Dougherty

2018
:
222)

Now
the
dictates
of
conscience
can
either
be
right
,
if
correctly
deduced
from
the
natural
law
,
or
wrong
,
if
they
are
incorrectly
deduced
.


The
dictates
of
the
former
are
the
product
of
a
“correct
conscience”
and
the
judgements
of
the
latter
are
the
result
of
an
“erroneous
conscience”
.


Since
synderesis
is
infallible
,
the
main
source
of
an
erroneous
conscience
,
when
it
does
occur
,
is
the
agent’s
adoption
of
a
faulty
minor
premise
in
the
practical
syllogism
(De
veritate
q
.


17
,
a
.


2
;
Potts
trans
.


1980
:
132–133)
.



Now
it
is
clear
that
we
have
an
obligation
to
follow
a
correct
conscience
since
to
do
so
contributes
to
achieving
our
final
end
.


But
what
of
an
erroneous
conscience
?


Does
this
have
any
authority
?


For
Aquinas
,
an
erring
conscience
also
binds
.


It
does
not
,
however
,
necessarily
excuse
.


As
Hoffmann
puts
it
,


regardless
of
whether
my
action
is
objectively
good
,
evil
or

indifferent
,
conscience
binds
,
for
it
is
by
means
of
conscience
that

an
action
is
proposed
to
me
as
good
,
bad
,
or
indifferent
.


(Hoffmann

2012
:
260)

For
example
,
it
is
objectively
right—in
accordance
with
the
natural
law—to
refrain
from
sex
outside
of
marriage
.


But
suppose
that
an
agent
(mistakenly)
believes
that
such
abstinence
is
sinful
,
and
yet
still
refrains
.


According
to
Aquinas
,
this
agent
,
although
he
does
what
is
objectively
right
,
nonetheless
sins
.


Why
?


Because
in
choosing
the
opposite
of
what
his
conscience
dictated
,
he
chose
to
do
something
he
believed
to
be
evil
.


And
choosing
what
is
(subjectively
if
not
objectively)
wrong
,
for
Aquinas
,
is
a
sin
:
“[F]
from
the
very
fact
that
a
thing
is
proposed
by
the
reason
as
being
evil
,
the
will
by
tending
thereto
becomes
evil”
(Summa
theologica
,
I-II
,
q
.


19
,
a
.


5
,
corp
.

)
.



What
follows
from
this
is
that
conscience
,
whether
right
or
erroneous
,
always
binds
.


As
to
the
question
of
whether
an
erroneous
conscience
excuses
,
on
the
other
hand
,
that
depends
on
the
type
of
ignorance
that
causes
it
.


This
is
because
some
types
of
ignorance
render
an
act
involuntary
and
therefore
excusable
,
and
some
do
not
.


Ignorance
that
excuses
is
called
invincible
,
and
concerns
ignorance
about
the
facts
of
the
situation
(assuming
,
of
course
,
there
is
no
negligence
involved)
.


Such
cases
,
that
is
,
where
an
agent
could
not
have
known
better
under
the
circumstances
and
would
not
have
thus
acted
had
he
known
better
,
are
excusable
.


Aquinas
uses
the
example
of
fornication—voluntary
,
illicit
sex—to
illustrate
his
point
.


Although
it
is
a
sin
to
commit
adultery
,
a
man
is
excused
if
he
has
sexual
relations
with
a
woman
who
is
not
his
wife
,
so
long
as
he
is
genuinely
,
if
improbably
,
mistakes
the
women
for
his
wife
.


This
is


because
this
error
arises
from
ignorance
of
a
circumstance
,
which

ignorance
excuses
,
and
causes
the
act
to
be
involuntary
.


(Summa

theologica
I-II
,
q
.


19
,
a
.


6
,
corp
.

)

Ignorance
that
contributes
to
an
erroneous
conscience
that
is
in
any
way
voluntary
is
vincible
,
or
able
to
be
corrected
,
and
therefore
culpable
if
followed
.


This
generally
happens
where
the
agent’s
ignorance
of
the
particulars
of
the
situation
is
either
the
result
of
negligence
,
or
where
there
is
ignorance
of
the
relevant
moral
principles
.


The
former
cases
are
the
result
of
the
agent
not
taking
appropriate
care
to
find
out
about
the
facts
of
situation
so
that
he
or
she
can
sin
while
feigning
ignorance
.


In
the
case
of
one’s
ignorance
of
universal
premises
,
this
too
is
culpable
since
it
is
one’s
obligation
to
know
the
moral
law
.


(Summa
theologica
I-II
,
q
.


19
,
a
.


6
,
corp
.

)
.



But
one
might
be
wondering
how
it
is
that
culpable
ignorance
is
even
possible
where
it
relates
to
general
moral
principles
.


How
can
one
go
wrong
about
the
universal
premises
that
form
the
major
premise
of
the
practical
syllogism
,
which
are
drawn
from
the
precepts
which
comprise
the
natural
law
,
if
synderesis
,
which
grasps
such
premises
,
is
infallible
?


Aquinas’s
answer
is
that
there
are
two
types
of
natural
law
precepts
:
primary—or
those
which
are
“most
general”—and
secondary
.


Aquinas
is
less
specific
on
this
topic
than
is
optimal
,
but
in
drawing
this
distinction
he
seems
to
mean
something
like
the
following
.


About
the
primary
precepts
of
the
natural
law
,
no-one
can
go
wrong
.


Unfortunately
,
as
we
have
seen
,
such
precepts
are
of
a
very
general
character
,
such
as
“do
good
and
avoid
evil”
.


For
such
general
knowledge
to
be
applicable
by
conscience
,
it
must
be
further
specified
.


This
further
specification
comprises
the
secondary
precepts
of
the
natural
law
,
which
are
closely
drawn
from
the
former
precepts
and
from
natural
inclination
.


About
such
secondary
,
derived
precepts
of
the
natural
law
,
such
as
“adultery
is
to
be
avoided”
,
humans
are
all
too
prone
to
become
ignorant
.


For
Aquinas
such
ignorance
is
the
result
either
of
vice
or
of
having
been
socialized
in
a
culture
with
“vicious
customs”
:


I
answer
that
[…]
there
belongs
to
the
natural
law
,
first
,
certain

most
general
precepts
,
that
are
known
to
all
;
and
secondly
,
certain

secondary
and
more
detailed
precepts
,
which
are
,
as
it
were
,

conclusions
following
closely
from
first
principles
.


As
to
those

general
principles
,
the
natural
law
,
in
the
abstract
,
can
nowise
be

blotted
out
from
men’s
hearts
.


[…]
But
as
to
[…]
the
secondary

precepts
,
the
natural
law
can
be
blotted
out
from
the
human
heart
,

either
by
evil
persuasions
,
just
as
in
speculative
matters
errors

occur
in
respect
of
necessary
conclusions
;
or
by
vicious
customs
and

corrupt
habits
[…]
.


(Summa
theologica
I-II
,
q
.


94
,
a
.


6
,
corp
.

)

A
final
problem
seems
to
emerge
:
are
we
not
,
according
to
Aquinas’s
account
of
the
erroneous
conscience
,
left
with
the
possibility
of
a
moral
dilemma
?


For
if
we
have
an
obligation
to
always
follow
our
consciences
,
but
we
sometimes
sin
when
we
do
follow
them
,
then
it
seems
that
we
are
sometimes
put
into
a
double
bind
.


We
seem
,
that
is
,
to
sometimes
have
conflicting
obligations
so
that
regardless
of
what
we
do
,
we
sin
.


Aquinas’s
solution
is
that
it
is
only
wrong
to
follow
a
conscience
that
is
in
a
state
of
vincible
ignorance
.


Since
such
ignorance
is
by
definition
correctable
,
we
can
always
resolve
the
apparent
dilemma
by
choosing
to
put
aside
our
ignorance
.


As
far
as
acting
from
invincible
ignorance
is
concerned
,
we
are
pardoned
.

William
of
Ockham
:
New
Directions
in
the
Understanding
of
Synderesis
and
Conscience

With
the
fourteenth-century
theologian
William
of
Ockham
(1285–1347)
we
encounter
some
radically
new
developments
on
the
topics
of
synderesis
and
conscience
.


While
Ockham’s
Franciscan
predecessor
John
Duns
Scotus
had
disagreements
with
Aquinas
about
the
nature
of
the
moral
law
,
Scotus
fundamentally
agreed
with
the
Dominican
in
viewing
synderesis
and
conscience
a
habit
and
an
act
of
the
practical
reason
,
respectively
,
whose
jobs
were
to
apprehend
the
basic
principles
of
morality
in
the
case
of
synderesis
,
and
to
apply
them
in
the
case
of
conscience
(John
Duns
Scotus
,
Ordinatio
2
,
d
.


39
;
Wolter
trans
.


1997
:
162–163)
.


Like
Scotus
,
Ockham
also
agrees
with
Aquinas
in
several
crucial
respects
.


Where
Ockham
departs
from
Aquinas
,
and
indeed
with
the
entire
scholastic
tradition
which
preceded
him
,
however
,
is
in
his
abandonment
of
the
concept
of
synderesis
,
and
in
his
unique
approach
to
the
invincibly
erroneous
conscience
.



It
is
difficult
to
know
for
certain
why
Ockham
abandoned
the
concept
of
synderesis
.


Michael
Baylor
,
however
,
has
suggested
two
possibilities
.


The
first
is
that
,
as
we
have
seen
,
synderesis
was
regarded
by
Ockham’s
predecessors
,
like
Aquinas
,
as
an
inborn
habit
.


But
for
Ockham
,
rational
agents
only
come
to
possess
habits
by
acquiring
them
,
and
they
can
only
acquire
them
by
doing
the
relevant
acts
repeatedly
.


The
notion
that
a
habit
could
be
innate
,
then
,
would
have
seemed
incoherent
to
Ockham
(Baylor
1977
:
78
;
Fuchs
1952
:
5–6)
.



The
second
possible
explanation—though
Baylor
thinks
this
implausible—has
to
do
with
the
way
that
Ockham
understands
the
foundations
of
morality
as
compared
with
Aquinas
.


For
Ockham
,
there
is
no
essential
connection
between
the
moral
order
as
it
currently
exists
and
the
divine
wisdom
.


The
highest
norm
of
morality
is
the
divine
will
.


It
just
so
happens
that
murder
,
for
example
,
is
wrong
today
.


But
there
is
no
reason
that
God
could
not
make
murder
right
tomorrow
if
he
so
willed
.


The
moral
order
,
in
short
,
is
contingent
.


On
the
Thomistic
view
,
however
,
the
natural
law
is
a
participation
in
the
eternal
law
.


It
is
the
point
of
contact
between
God’s
plan
for
us
as
conceived
in
the
divine
mind
,
on
the
one
hand
,
and
the
human
intellect
,
on
the
other
.


Synderesis
,
as
we
saw
above
,
plays
a
key
role
in
this
connection
insofar
as
it
grasps
the
moral
principles
that
lead
human
beings
to
their
final
destiny
.


Moreover
,
the
moral
principles
that
guide
us
in
how
to
achieve
our
final
end
are
as
true
today
as
they
were
yesterday
,
and
indeed
will
be
for
all
time
,
owing
to
the
natures
that
God
has
bestowed
upon
us
.


As
Baylor
writes
:


As
the
element
of
man’s
original
nature
which
was
substantially

undamaged
after
Adam’s
fall
,
the
synteresis
was
the
anthropological

point
of
connection
between
an
abiding
moral
order
,
which
manifested

ideas
in
the
divine
intellect
according
to
which
creation
was

necessarily
ordered
,
and
man’s
certain
knowledge
of
universal

principles
of
that
moral
order
.


Ockham
,
however
,
stressed
the
absolute

contingency
of
creation
[…]
For
Ockham
,
God’s
will
,
as
manifested
in

the
moral
precepts
he
has
ordained
,
constitutes
the
ultimate
and

objective
norm
of
morality
.


God
is
under
no
obligation
;
rather
,
it
is

divine
will
which
determines
moral
obligation
.


This
awesome
conception

of
divine
liberty
and
omnipotence
,
and
the
contingency
of
the
created

order
has
led
many
to
the
conclusion
that
the
objective
basis
of

Ockham’s
ethics
is
authoritarian
or
positivistic
and
inherently

unstable
since
it
appears
to
depend
only
upon
an
alterable
divine

fiat
.


If
this
were
so
,
then
it
would
appear
odd
also
to
posit
within

man
an
inborn
and
inalienable
knowledge
of
moral
principles
in
the

form
of
synteresis
.


(Baylor
1977
:
79–80)

A
distinguished
proponent
of
the
interpretation
Baylor
describes
was
Servais
Pinckaers
.


Because
the
foundations
of
morality
are
rooted
in
the
divine
will
,
which
can
change
,
there
was
no
need
for
Ockham
to
resort
to
a
mechanism
that
discovers
the
eternal
principles
of
morality
as
these
emerge
from
human
nature
since
,
for
Ockham
,
no
such
principles
exist
.


Rather
,
according
to
Pinckaers’
interpretation
of
Ockham
,
moral
principles
are
known
through
revelation
.


(Pinckaers
1993
:
258)
.


While
Pinckaers
was
correct
in
his
assessment
of
Ockham’s
metaethics—which
is
fundamentally
authoritarian
despite
elements
of
rationalism—he
was
wrong
in
his
characterization
of
Ockham’s
moral
epistemology
.


This
is
because
,
while
it
is
indeed
possible
to
come
to
know
the
principles
of
morality
via
divine
revelation
,
on
Ockham’s
account
,
it
is
also
possible
,
despite
their
grounding
in
God’s
will
,
to
come
to
know
them
via
natural
reason
and
experience
(see
Eardley
2013
:
82–87)
.


Examples
of
the
former
,
that
is
,
of
principles
that
are
self-evidently
true
,
are
“every
blameworthy
evil
is
to
be
avoided”
and
“the
will
ought
to
conform
itself
to
right
reason”
.


An
example
of
a
moral
proposition
that
is
grounded
in
experience
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
“an
angry
man
should
be
calmed
with
soothing
words”
(Eardley
2013
:
86–87)
.


God
obviously
wills
that
we
should
follow
such
injunctions
.


But
how
can
we
know
his
will
if
not
through
revelation
?


Although
the
contemporary
philosopher
Peter
Geach
was
not
a
particularly
sympathetic
reader
of
Ockham
,
he
was
willing
to
concede
the
possibility
that
a
metaethics
grounded
in
divine
commands
could
nonetheless
yield
a
naturalistic
moral
epistemology
.


As
he
put
it
:


the
rational
recognition
that
a
practice
is
generally
undesirable
and

that
it
is
best
for
people
on
the
whole
not
even
to
think
of
resorting

to
it
is
thus
in
fact
a
promulgation
to
a
man
of
the
Divine
law

forbidding
the
practice
,
even
if
he
does
not
realise
that
this
is
a

promulgation
of
the
Divine
law
,
even
if
he
does
not
believe
there
is
a

God
.


(Geach
1981
:
170)

Ockham
would
have
agreed
.



A
second
and
related
way
in
which
Pinckaers
misinterpreted
Ockham’s
moral
epistemology
was
Pinckaers’
assumption
that
,
because
Ockham
discarded
the
traditional
notion
of
synderesis
,
he
must
have
done
the
same
for
its
twin
concept
of
conscience
.


Pinckaers
conceded
that
moral
principles
,
even
if
rooted
in
the
divine
will
,
still
need
to
be
applied
to
particular
situations
on
Ockham’s
account
.


This
role
was
,
of
course
,
reserved
for
conscience
in
the
earlier
tradition
.


In
Ockham
,
according
to
Pinckaers
,
this
role
now
became
associated
with
practical
reason
and
prudence
(Pinckaers
1993
:
259)
.



A
closer
reading
of
the
textual
evidence
suggests
that
Ockham
very
much
made
use
of
the
traditional
concept
of
conscience
.


Indeed
,
much
of
how
he
employed
the
concept
was
consistent
with
the
tradition
,
especially
as
articulated
by
Aquinas
.


Ockham
associates
the
dictates
of
practical
reason
,
for
example
,
with
judgements
of
conscience
.


He
is
also
emphatic
in
his
belief
that
rational
agents
have
an
absolute
obligation
to
follow
their
consciences
,
which
can
be
correct
or
erroneous
(Quaestiones
variae
,
q
.


8
,
a
.


1
,
OTh
8
:
411)
.


A
conscience
is
correct
when
it
is
in
accord
with
right
reason
;
it
is
erroneous
when
it
is
not
.


Finally
,
an
erroneous
conscience
,
for
Ockham
,
as
with
Aquinas
,
is
either
in
a
state
of
vincible—voluntary
and
therefore
culpable—ignorance
,
or
in
a
state
of
invincible—or
involuntary—ignorance
.


Where
conscience
is
in
a
state
of
vincible
ignorance
,
we
must
do
our
best
to
set
it
aside
.


In
all
these
cases
Ockham
follows
the
tradition
,
with
one
exception
:
that
of
the
invincibly
erroneous
conscience
(Eardley
2013
:
94–98)
,
the
state
in
which
the
agent
finds
himself
with
the
correct
universal
principles
,
but
non-culpably
errs
with
respect
to
his
grasp
of
the
circumstances
in
which
he
finds
himself
.



In
what
sense
does
Ockham
depart
from
the
tradition
?


For
Ockham
,
the
act
of
following
an
invincibly
erroneous
conscience
is
not
merely
excusable
,
as
it
was
For
Aquinas
,
but
“virtuous
and
meritorious”
.


Consider
the
following
example
from
Ockham
.


While
walking
down
the
street
one
day
you
pass
a
homeless
person
who
asks
you
for
money
.


He
appears
to
have
a
moral
claim
on
you
since
you
assent
to
the
moral
principle
that
“help
is
to
be
given
to
every
needy
person
in
extreme
need
lest
he
die”
.


Does
he
appear
needy
,
and
indeed
desperate
to
you
?


Yes
.


Sizing
him
up
,
you
determine
that
,
although
it
is
theoretically
possible
that
he
could
be
fraud
,
this
seems
unlikely
.


For
Ockham
,
you
are
obliged
in
this
instance
to
follow
your
conscience
,
and
indeed
you
do
.


It
turns
out
,
however
,
that
this
apparent
homeless
person
is
in
fact
a
very
wealthy
person
who
is
impersonating
a
beggar
.


For
Ockham
,
in
following
your
conscience
,
you
are
not
merely
excused
or
absolved
of
your
error
,
but
your
(ignorant)
act
is
virtuous
and
,
indeed
,
regarded
by
God
as
meritorious
(so
long
,
that
is
,
that
your
act
of
charity
is
done
out
of
love
for
God)
.


As
Ockham
puts
it
:


Consequently
,
[in
the
above
case]
a
right
act
of
the
will
and
an
error

of
the
intellect
remain
at
the
same
time
with
respect
to
the
same

object
.


And
the
whole
reason
is
because
that
error
is
not
in
the
power

of
the
one
who
is
mistaken
,
who
took
all
due
diligence
to
find
out
the

truth
,
and
therefore
that
error
excuses
from
every
sin
.


And

consequently
,
the
will
that
elicits
the
act
in
conformity
to
such

[invincibly]
erroneous
reason
acts
virtuously
and
meritoriously
.



Indeed
,
had
he
not
,
while
in
such
error
,
willed
to
help
that
person
,

he
would
have
performed
a
vicious
and
demeritorious
act
because
such

an
act
would
have
been
knowingly
elicited
against
conscience
and

against
non-culpable
reason
,
because
in
the
aforementioned
case
he

does
not
know
that
he
is
in
error
but
believes
that
he
possesses
right

reason
,
and
consequently
by
despising
reason
[in
this
way]
he
sins

mortally
.


(Quaestiones
varie
q
.


8
,
a
.


2
,
Oth
8
:
423–424)

What
is
motivating
Ockham’s
novel
suggestion
?


Even
Aquinas
admitted
that
we
have
an
obligation
to
follow
our
consciences
,
whether
right
or
erroneous
.


When
we
do
not
do
so
,
according
to
Aquinas
,
we
sin
.


Of
course
,
when
our
consciences
are
in
a
state
of
voluntary
or
vincible
ignorance
we
also
have
a
duty
to
put
aside
our
error
,
otherwise
we
sin
.


It
is
obviously
not
possible
,
however
,
to
put
error
aside
in
the
case
of
invincible
ignorance
since
such
ignorance
is
by
definition
involuntary
.


Accordingly
,
for
Aquinas
,
we
are
obliged
to
follow
such
a
conscience
.


Although
we
act
wrongly
,
in
such
cases
,
we
are
,
for
Aquinas
,
excused
on
the
grounds
that
we
could
not
have
known
better
.


To
return
to
Aquinas’s
example
of
inadvertently
sleeping
with
someone
who
is
not
your
spouse
:
this
might
be
excusable
,
for
Aquinas
,
but
there
is
no
possibility
that
such
an
act
might
be
considered
virtuous
,
much
less
meritorious
.


But
for
Ockham
,
if
it
is
vicious
and
therefore
punishable
not
to
follow
an
invincibly
erroneous
conscience
,
then
merely
being
excused
for
following
it
when
we
are
under
a
moral
obligation
to
do
so
would
be
an
insufficient
reward
.


Rather
,
it
should
logically
follow
that
it
is
virtuous
and
therefore
meritorious
.

Why
did
the
experience
of
consciousness
evolve
from
our
underlying
brain
physiology
?


Despite
being
a
vibrant
area
of
neuroscience
,
current
research
on
consciousness
is
characterised
by
disagreement
and
controversy
–
with
several
rival
theories
in
contention
.



A
recent
scoping
review
of
over
1
,000
articles
identified
over
20
different
theoretical
accounts
.


Philosophers
like
David
Chalmers
argue
that
no
single
scientific
theory
can
truly
explain
consciousness
.



We
define
consciousness
as
embodied
subjective
awareness
,
including
self
awareness
.


In
a
recent
article
published
in
Interalia
(which
is
not
peer
reviewed)
,
we
argue
that
one
reason
for
this
predicament
is
the
powerful
role
played
by
intuition
.



We
are
not
alone
.


Social
scientist
Jacy
Reese
Anthis
writes
“much
of
the
debate
on
the
fundamental
nature
of
consciousness
takes
the
form
of
intuition
jousting
,
in
which
the
different
parties
each
report
their
own
strong
intuitions
and
joust
them
against
each
other”
.



Dangers
of
intuition

Key
intuitive
beliefs
–
for
example
that
our
mental
processes
are
distinct
from
our
physical
bodies
(mind-body
dualism)
and
that
our
mental
processes
give
rise
to
and
control
our
decisions
and
actions
(mental
causation)
–
are
supported
by
a
lifetime
of
subjective
experiences
.



These
beliefs
are
found
in
all
human
cultures
.


They
are
important
as
they
serve
as
foundational
beliefs
for
most
liberal
democracies
and
criminal
justice
systems
.


They
are
resistant
to
counter
evidence
.


That’s
because
they
are
powerfully
endorsed
by
social
and
cultural
concepts
such
as
free
will
,
human
rights
,
democracy
,
justice
and
moral
responsibility
.


All
these
concepts
assume
that
consciousness
plays
a
central
controlling
influence
.



Intuition
,
however
,
is
an
automatic
,
cognitive
process
that
evolved
to
provide
fast
trusted
explanations
and
predictions
.


In
fact
,
it
does
so
without
the
need
for
us
to
know
how
or
why
we
know
it
.


The
outcomes
of
intuition
therefore
shape
how
we
perceive
and
explain
our
everyday
world
without
the
need
for
extensive
reflection
or
formal
analytic
explanations
.



While
helpful
and
indeed
crucial
for
many
everyday
activities
,
intuitive
beliefs
can
be
wrong
.


They
can
also
interfere
with
scientific
literacy
.



Intuitive
accounts
of
consciousness
ultimately
put
us
in
the
driver’s
seat
as
“captain
of
our
own
ship”
.


We
think
we
know
what
consciousness
is
and
what
it
does
from
simply
experiencing
it
.


Mental
thoughts
,
intentions
and
desires
are
seen
as
determining
and
controlling
our
actions
.



The
widespread
acceptance
of
these
tacit
intuitive
accounts
helps
explain
,
in
part
,
why
the
formal
study
of
consciousness
was
relegated
to
the
margins
of
mainstream
neuroscience
until
late
20th
century
.



The
problem
for
scientific
models
of
consciousness
remains
accommodating
these
intuitive
accounts
within
a
materialist
framework
consistent
with
the
findings
of
neuroscience
.


While
there
is
no
current
scientific
explanation
for
how
brain
tissue
generates
or
maintains
subjective
experience
,
the
consensus
among
(most)
neuroscientists
is
that
it
is
a
product
of
brain
processes
.



Social
purpose

If
that’s
the
case
,
why
did
consciousness
,
defined
as
subjective
awareness
,
evolve
?



Consciousness
presumably
evolved
as
part
of
the
evolution
of
the
nervous
system
.


According
to
several
theories
the
key
adaptive
function
(providing
an
organism
with
survival
and
reproductive
benefits)
of
consciousness
is
to
make
volitional
movement
possible
.


And
volition
is
something
we
ultimately
associate
with
will
,
agency
and
individuality
.


It
is
therefore
easy
to
think
that
consciousness
evolved
to
benefit
us
as
individuals
.



Humans
are
a
highly
social
species
.


Esteban
De
Armas/Shuttestock

But
we
have
argued
that
consciousness
may
have
evolved
to
facilitate
key
social
adaptive
functions
.


Rather
than
helping
individuals
survive
,
it
evolved
to
help
us
broadcast
our
experienced
ideas
and
feelings
into
the
wider
world
.


And
this
might
benefit
the
survival
and
wellbeing
of
the
wider
species
.



The
idea
fits
with
new
thinking
on
genetics
.


While
evolutionary
science
traditionally
focuses
on
individual
genes
,
there
is
growing
recognition
that
natural
selection
among
humans
operates
at
multiple
levels
.


For
example
,
culture
and
society
influence
traits
passed
on
between
generations
–
we
value
some
more
than
others
.



Central
to
our
account
is
the
idea
that
sociality
(the
tendency
of
groups
and
individuals
to
develop
social
links
and
live
in
communities)
is
a
key
survival
strategy
that
influences
how
the
brain
and
cognition
evolve
.



Adopting
this
social
evolutionary
framework
,
we
propose
that
subjective
awareness
lacks
any
independent
capacity
to
causally
influence
other
psychological
processes
or
actions
.


An
example
would
be
initiating
a
course
of
action
.


The
idea
that
subjective
awareness
has
a
social
purpose
has
been
described
previously
by
other
reserachers
.



The
claim
that
subjective
awareness
is
without
causal
influence
,
however
,
is
not
to
deny
the
reality
of
subjective
experience
or
claim
that
the
experience
is
an
illusion
.



While
our
model
removes
subjective
awareness
from
the
traditional
driving
seat
of
the
mind
,
it
does
not
imply
that
we
don’t
value
private
internal
experiences
.


Indeed
,
it
is
precisely
because
of
the
value
we
place
on
these
experiences
that
intuitive
accounts
remain
compelling
and
widespread
in
social
and
legal
organisation
systems
and
psychology
.



While
it
is
counter-intuitive
to
attribute
agency
and
personal
accountability
to
a
biological
assembly
of
nerve
cells
,
it
makes
sense
that
highly
valued
social
constructs
such
as
free
will
,
truth
,
honesty
and
fairness
can
be
meaningfully
attributed
to
individuals
as
accountable
people
in
a
social
community
.



Think
about
it
.


While
we
are
deeply
rooted
in
our
biological
nature
,
our
social
nature
is
largely
defined
by
our
roles
and
interactions
in
society
.


As
such
,
the
mental
architecture
of
the
mind
should
be
strongly
adapted
for
the
exchange
and
reception
of
information
,
ideas
and
feelings
.


Consequently
,
while
brains
as
biological
organs
are
incapable
of
responsibility
and
agency
,
legal
and
social
traditions
have
long
held
individuals
accountable
for
their
behaviour
.



Key
to
achieving
a
more
scientific
explanation
of
subjective
awareness
requires
accepting
that
biology
and
culture
work
collectively
to
shape
how
brains
evolve
.


Subjective
awareness
comprises
only
one
part
of
the
brain’s
much
larger
mental
architecture
designed
to
facilitate
species
survival
and
wellbeing
.

Conscious
Leadership
:
What
is
it
and
its
Benefits

[Picture

Kilpatrick

Consciously
acknowledging
an
error
or
weakness
,
as
well
as
a
strength
,
is
the
starting
point
for
learning
and
generating
improvements
through
concrete
actions
.


This
is
precisely
what
conscious
leadership
is
about
.



Next
,
we
will
provide
more
information
about
this
new
type
of
leadership
,
explaining
its
characteristics
,
the
skills
involved
,
and
the
benefits
it
brings
to
organizations
and
their
teams
.



 

What
is
Conscious
Leadership
?



 

The
key
to
this
type
of
leadership
is
precisely
the
consciousness
of
the
act
of
leading
.


It
means
that
being
aware
is
not
just
about
realizing
it
but
also
about
being
capable
of
reflecting
on
our
actions
,
roles
,
and
the
repercussions
of
the
actions
we
execute
.



This
type
of
leadership
implies
that
those
in
charge
of
a
company’s
destiny
are
fully
present
in
their
roles
,
committed
,
and
engaged
.


Only
from
there
can
they
make
conscious
decisions
,
generating
trust
and
inspiring
teams
.



An
essential
aspect
of
practicing
conscious
leadership
is
taking
responsibility
for
mistakes
and
learning
from
them
,
while
also
analyzing
successes
to
replicate
them
.


All
of
this
is
done
in
order
to
better
guide
teams
and
the
company
.



 

Difference
from
Traditional
Leadership

Conscious
leadership
and
traditional
leadership
are
not
differentiated
by
just
a
single
word
.


While
traditional
leadership
focuses
on
achieving
economic
results
,
conscious
leadership
places
emphasis
on
three
aspects
of
value
generation
within
the
company
:
profitability
,
social
development
,
and
environmental
care
.



Additionally
,
traditional
leadership
revolves
around
a
leader
who
prioritizes
these
results
over
personal
attributes
when
making
decisions
,
whereas
conscious
leadership
requires
a
leader
who
seeks
self-awareness
.


This
entails
understanding
one’s
strengths
and
weaknesses
,
as
well
as
the
importance
of
making
decisions
and
acting
with
social
and
ethical
responsibility
.



This
significant
difference
makes
conscious
leadership
the
result
of
a
reflective
process
in
which
the
leader
knows
oneself
to
then
know
and
accept
others
.


The
challenge
lies
in
promoting
and
implementing
within
work
teams
the
aspects
,
qualities
,
and
business
skills
that
echo
conscious
leadership
.



 

 

 

The
Importance
of
a
Conscious
Leader

A
conscious
leader
is
a
figure
that
is
increasingly
gaining
prominence
in
companies
.


Consciousness
applied
to
decision-making
within
an
organization
is
crucial
for
leading
positive
changes
.


Why
?


Because
it
allows
for
the
consideration
of
different
variables
involved
.



In
a
way
,
conscious
leadership
is
based
on
the
idea
that
conscious
leaders
can
make
a
difference
and
lead
their
teams
towards
excellence
,
happiness
,
and
well-being
.



Adopting
this
approach
by
the
leader
is
important
,
as
it
can
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
company’s
culture
,
employee
satisfaction
,
and
team
performance
.



 

Characteristics
of
a
Conscious
Leader

A
good
conscious
leader
doesn’t
just
have
to
appear
to
be
one
,
but
actually
be
one
.


Here
are
some
of
the
general
characteristics
they
should
possess
:

1
.


Ability
to
listen
:
It’s
not
always
the
time
to
speak
,
but
often
the

time
to
listen
.


And
it
should
be
done
actively
,
paying
attention
to

every
detail
conveyed
by
the
words
and
body
language
of
others
.


2
.


The
importance
of
leading
by
example
:
To
be
a
good
conscious
leader
,

you
must
preach
and
practice
at
the
same
time
.


Leading
by
example

allows
the
team
to
see
that
you’re
the
first
person
to
align

yourself
with
the
principles
you
promote
.


3
.


Promoting
collaboration
:
Encourage
not
only
teamwork
but
also

collaboration
among
members
of
the
organization
and
foster
healthy

competition
.


4
.


Observational
skills
:
It’s
not
just
about
taking
action
.


As
a

conscious
leader
,
you
should
have
the
ability
to
step
back
and
gain

perspective
,
observe
,
and
consider
alternative
options
,
bringing

forth
new
ideas
.


5
.


Clarity
:
Decisions
should
be
made
with
clarity
,
as
the
team
needs
to

see
that
you
are
confident
in
your
actions
,
which
generates
the

necessary
trust
within
the
team
.


6
.


The
importance
of
smiling
:
It’s
important
to
convey
calmness
and

happiness
,
even
in
challenging
circumstances
.


Fostering
a
happy
team

translates
into
a
motivated
team
that
performs
better
.


7
.


Assertiveness
:
Communication
from
a
conscious
leader
is
consistently

assertive
.


They
express
their
thoughts
and
ideas
honestly
and

simply
.


This
allows
each
team
member
to
know
what
is
expected
of

them
,
fostering
confidence
and
clarity
in
their
work
lives
.


8
.


Recognizing
mistakes
:
As
mentioned
earlier
,
a
conscious
leader
is

based
on
self-awareness
,
which
involves
recognizing
mistakes
.



Acknowledging
mistakes
is
the
foundation
for
improvement
and
change
.



This
is
not
seen
as
a
weakness
by
the
team
but
rather
as
a
sign
of
a

human
leader
who
is
continuously
striving
for
improvement
.



 

Advantages
of
Conscious
Leadership

When
it
comes
to
benefits
,
there
are
several
advantages
associated
with
conscious
leadership
,
such
as
the
following
:

1
.


Better
understanding
of
the
company’s
vision
:
Conscious
leadership

involves
identifying
and
calibrating
the
different
and
most

important
aspects
of
the
organization
so
that
the
team
can
focus
on

them
.


A
conscious
leader
considers
goals
in
relation
to
the
purpose

and
vision
of
the
company
.


2
.


Talent
development
:
Conscious
leadership
attracts
talent
to

companies
.


Moreover
,
through
the
development
of
good
practices
,

talent
chooses
to
stay
because
it’s
not
about
retention
but
rather

growth
.


3
.


Improved
work
relationships
:
As
mentioned
before
,
a
conscious
leader

promotes
positive
teamwork
and
collaboration
.


This
leads
to
better

project
outcomes
and
fewer
interpersonal
conflicts
since
the

emphasis
is
on
group
performance
rather
than
individual

contributions
.


4
.


Increased
job
satisfaction
:
It’s
not
just
about
directing
,
but
also

about
motivating
teams
and
helping
them
improve
.


Encouraging
them
to

become
drivers
of
change
and
innovation
within
the
company
.


5
.


Higher
productivity
:
When
employees
feel
valued
,
engaged
,
motivated
,

and
satisfied
,
employee
turnover
decreases
,
and
absenteeism
reduces
,

resulting
in
increased
productivity
.


6
.


Inspiring
leadership
:
Soft
skills
are
promoted
,
which
allow
for

greater
well-being
from
within
to
the
outside
.


Being
at
peace
with

oneself
translates
into
being
at
peace
with
others
.

Representation
of
consciousness
from
the
17th
century
by
Robert
Fludd
,
an
English
Paracelsian
physician

Consciousness
,
at
its
simplest
,
is
awareness
of
internal
and
external
existence
.

^([1])
However
,
its
nature
has
led
to
millennia
of
analyses
,
explanations
,
and
debate
by
philosophers
,
scientists
,
and
theologians
.


Opinions
differ
about
what
exactly
needs
to
be
studied
or
even
considered
consciousness
.


In
some
explanations
,
it
is
synonymous
with
the
mind
,
and
at
other
times
,
an
aspect
of
it
.


In
the
past
,
it
was
one
'
s
"inner
life"
,
the
world
of
introspection
,
of
private
thought
,
imagination
,
and
volition
.

^([2])
Today
,
it
often
includes
any
kind
of
cognition
,
experience
,
feeling
,
or
perception
.


It
may
be
awareness
,
awareness
of
awareness
,
metacognition
,
or
self-awareness
,
either
continuously
changing
or
not
.

^([3][4])
The
disparate
range
of
research
,
notions
,
and
speculations
raises
a
curiosity
about
whether
the
right
questions
are
being
asked
.

^([5])

Examples
of
the
range
of
descriptions
,
definitions
or
explanations
are
:
ordered
distinction
between
self
and
environment
,
simple
wakefulness
,
one
'
s
sense
of
selfhood
or
soul
explored
by
"looking
within"
;
being
a
metaphorical
"stream"
of
contents
,
or
being
a
mental
state
,
mental
event
,
or
mental
process
of
the
brain
.



Etymology

[edit]

The
words
"conscious"
and
"consciousness"
in
the
English
language
date
to
the
17th
century
,
and
the
first
recorded
use
of
"conscious"
as
a
simple
adjective
was
applied
figuratively
to
inanimate
objects
("the
conscious
Groves"
,
1643)
.

^([6]
:
175
)
It
derived
from
the
Latin
conscius
(con-
"together"
and
scio
"to
know")
which
meant
"knowing
with"
or
"having
joint
or
common
knowledge
with
another"
,
especially
as
in
sharing
a
secret
.

^([7])
Thomas
Hobbes
in
Leviathan
(1651)
wrote
:
"Where
two
,
or
more
men
,
know
of
one
and
the
same
fact
,
they
are
said
to
be
Conscious
of
it
one
to
another"
.

^([8])
There
were
also
many
occurrences
in
Latin
writings
of
the
phrase
conscius
sibi
,
which
translates
literally
as
"knowing
with
oneself"
,
or
in
other
words
"sharing
knowledge
with
oneself
about
something"
.


This
phrase
has
the
figurative
sense
of
"knowing
that
one
knows"
,
which
is
something
like
the
modern
English
word
"conscious"
,
but
it
was
rendered
into
English
as
"conscious
to
oneself"
or
"conscious
unto
oneself"
.


For
example
,
Archbishop
Ussher
wrote
in
1613
of
"being
so
conscious
unto
myself
of
my
great
weakness"
.

^([9])

The
Latin
conscientia
,
literally

'
knowledge-with
'

,
first
appears
in
Roman
juridical
texts
by
writers
such
as
Cicero
.


It
means
a
kind
of
shared
knowledge
with
moral
value
,
specifically
what
a
witness
knows
of
someone
else
'
s
deeds
.

^([10][11])
Although
René
Descartes
(1596–1650)
,
writing
in
Latin
,
is
generally
taken
to
be
the
first
philosopher
to
use
conscientia
in
a
way
less
like
the
traditional
meaning
and
more
like
the
way
modern
English
speakers
would
use
"conscience"
,
his
meaning
is
nowhere
defined
.

^([12])
In
Search
after
Truth
(Regulæ
ad
directionem
ingenii
ut
et
inquisitio
veritatis
per
lumen
naturale
,
Amsterdam
1701)
he
wrote
the
word
with
a
gloss
:
conscientiâ
,
vel
interno
testimonio
(translatable
as
"conscience
,
or
internal
testimony")
.

^([13][14])
It
might
mean
the
knowledge
of
the
value
of
one
'
s
own
thoughts
.

John
Locke
,
a
17th-century
British
Age
of
Enlightenment
philosopher

The
origin
of
the
modern
concept
of
consciousness
is
often
attributed
to
John
Locke
who
defined
the
word
in
his
Essay
Concerning
Human
Understanding
,
published
in
1690
,
as
"the
perception
of
what
passes
in
a
man
'
s
own
mind"
.

^([15][16])
The
essay
strongly
influenced
18th-century
British
philosophy
,
and
Locke
'
s
definition
appeared
in
Samuel
Johnson
'
s
celebrated
Dictionary
(1755)
.

^([17])

The
French
term
conscience
is
defined
roughly
like
English
"consciousness"
in
the
1753
volume
of
Diderot
and
d
'
Alembert
'
s
Encyclopédie
as
"the
opinion
or
internal
feeling
that
we
ourselves
have
from
what
we
do"
.

^([18])

Problem
of
definition

[edit]


About
forty
meanings
attributed
to
the
term
consciousness
can
be

identified
and
categorized
based
on
functions
and
experiences
.


The

prospects
for
reaching
any
single
,
agreed-upon
,
theory-independent

definition
of
consciousness
appear
remote
.

^([19])

Scholars
are
divided
as
to
whether
Aristotle
had
a
concept
of
consciousness
.


He
does
not
use
any
single
word
or
terminology
that
is
clearly
similar
to
the
phenomenon
or
concept
defined
by
John
Locke
.


Victor
Caston
contends
that
Aristotle
did
have
a
concept
more
clearly
similar
to
perception
.

^([20])

Modern
dictionary
definitions
of
the
word
consciousness
evolved
over
several
centuries
and
reflect
a
range
of
seemingly
related
meanings
,
with
some
differences
that
have
been
controversial
,
such
as
the
distinction
between
inward
awareness
and
perception
of
the
physical
world
,
or
the
distinction
between
conscious
and
unconscious
,
or
the
notion
of
a
mental
entity
or
mental
activity
that
is
not
physical
.



The
common-usage
definitions
of
consciousness
in
Webster

(1966)
are
as

:

The
Cambridge
English
Dictionary
defines
consciousness
as
"the
state
of
understanding
and
realizing
something"
.

^([21])
The
Oxford
Living
Dictionary
defines
consciousness
as
"[t]he
state
of
being
aware
of
and
responsive
to
one
'
s
surroundings"
,
"[a]
person
'
s
awareness
or
perception
of
something"
,
and
"[t]he
fact
of
awareness
by
the
mind
of
itself
and
the
world"
.

^([22])

Philosophers
have
attempted
to
clarify
technical
distinctions
by
using
a
jargon
of
their
own
.


The
corresponding
entry
in
the
Routledge
Encyclopedia
of
Philosophy
(1998)
reads
:

Consciousness

Philosophers
have
used
the
term
consciousness
for
four
main
topics
:

knowledge
in
general
,
intentionality
,
introspection
(and
the

knowledge
it
specifically
generates)
and
phenomenal
experience
.


.


.



Something
within
one
'
s
mind
is

'
introspectively
conscious
'

just
in

case
one
introspects
it
(or
is
poised
to
do
so)
.


Introspection
is

often
thought
to
deliver
one
'
s
primary
knowledge
of
one
'
s
mental

life
.


An
experience
or
other
mental
entity
is

'
phenomenally

conscious
'

just
in
case
there
is

'
something
it
is
like
'

for
one
to

have
it
.


The
clearest
examples
are
:
perceptual
experience
,
such
as

tastings
and
seeings
;
bodily-sensational
experiences
,
such
as
those

of
pains
,
tickles
and
itches
;
imaginative
experiences
,
such
as
those

of
one
'
s
own
actions
or
perceptions
;
and
streams
of
thought
,
as
in

the
experience
of
thinking

'
in
words
'

or

'
in
images
'

.


Introspection

and
phenomenality
seem
independent
,
or
dissociable
,
although
this
is

controversial
.

^([23])

Traditional
metaphors
for
mind

[edit]

During
the
early
19th
century
,
the
emerging
field
of
geology
inspired
a
popular
metaphor
that
the
mind
likewise
had
hidden
layers
"which
recorded
the
past
of
the
individual"
.

^([24]
:
3
)
By
1875
,
most
psychologists
believed
that
"consciousness
was
but
a
small
part
of
mental
life"
,^([24]
:
3
)
and
this
idea
underlies
the
goal
of
Freudian
therapy
,
to
expose
the
unconscious
layer
of
the
mind
.



Other
metaphors
from
various
sciences
inspired
other
analyses
of
the
mind
,
for
example
:
Johann
Friedrich
Herbart
described
ideas
as
being
attracted
and
repulsed
like
magnets
;
John
Stuart
Mill
developed
the
idea
of
"mental
chemistry"
and
"mental
compounds"
,
and
Edward
B
.


Titchener
sought
the
"structure"
of
the
mind
by
analyzing
its
"elements"
.


The
abstract
idea
of
states
of
consciousness
mirrored
the
concept
of
states
of
matter
.



In
1892
,
William
James
noted
that
the
"ambiguous
word

'
content
'

has
been
recently
invented
instead
of

'
object
'
"
and
that
the
metaphor
of
mind
as
a
container
seemed
to
minimize
the
dualistic
problem
of
how
"states
of
consciousness
can
know"
things
,
or
objects
;^([25]
:
465
)
by
1899
psychologists
were
busily
studying
the
"contents
of
conscious
experience
by
introspection
and
experiment"
.

^([26]
:
365
)
Another
popular
metaphor
was
James
'
s
doctrine
of
the
stream
of
consciousness
,
with
continuity
,
fringes
,
and
transitions
.

^([25]
:
vii
[a])

James
discussed
the
difficulties
of
describing
and
studying
psychological
phenomena
,
recognizing
that
commonly-used
terminology
was
a
necessary
and
acceptable
starting
point
towards
more
precise
,
scientifically
justified
language
.


Prime
examples
were
phrases
like
inner
experience
and
personal
consciousness
:


The
first
and
foremost
concrete
fact
which
every
one
will
affirm
to

belong
to
his
inner
experience
is
the
fact
that
consciousness
of
some

sort
goes
on
.



'
States
of
mind
'

succeed
each
other
in
him
.


[
.


.


.

]
But

everyone
knows
what
the
terms
mean
[only]
in
a
rough
way
;
[
.


.


.

]
When
I

say
every

'
state
'

or

'
thought
'

is
part
of
a
personal
consciousness
,


'
personal
consciousness
'

is
one
of
the
terms
in
question
.


Its
meaning

we
know
so
long
as
no
one
asks
us
to
define
it
,
but
to
give
an

accurate
account
of
it
is
the
most
difficult
of
philosophic
tasks
.



[
.


.


.

]
The
only
states
of
consciousness
that
we
naturally
deal
with
are

found
in
personal
consciousnesses
,
minds
,
selves
,
concrete
particular

I
'
s
and
you
'
s
.


^([25]

)

From
introspection
to
awareness

[edit]

Prior
to
the
20th
century
,
philosophers
treated
the
phenomenon
of
consciousness
as
the
"inner
world
[of]
one
'
s
own
mind"
,
and
introspection
was
the
mind
"attending
to"
itself
,^([b])
an
activity
seemingly
distinct
from
that
of
perceiving
the

'
outer
world
'

and
its
physical
phenomena
.


In
1892
William
James
noted
the
distinction
along
with
doubts
about
the
inward
character
of
the
mind
:



'
Things
'

have
been
doubted
,
but
thoughts
and
feelings
have
never
been

doubted
.


The
outer
world
,
but
never
the
inner
world
,
has
been
denied
.



Everyone
assumes
that
we
have
direct
introspective
acquaintance
with

our
thinking
activity
as
such
,
with
our
consciousness
as
something

inward
and
contrasted
with
the
outer
objects
which
it
knows
.


Yet
I

must
confess
that
for
my
part
I
cannot
feel
sure
of
this
conclusion
.



[
.


.


.

]
It
seems
as
if
consciousness
as
an
inner
activity
were
rather
a

postulate
than
a
sensibly
given
fact
.


.


.

^([25]
:
467
)

By
the
1960s
,
for
many
philosophers
and
psychologists
who
talked
about
consciousness
,
the
word
no
longer
meant
the

'
inner
world
'

but
an
indefinite
,
large
category
called
awareness
,
as
in
the
following
example
:


It
is
difficult
for
modern
Western
man
to
grasp
that
the
Greeks
really

had
no
concept
of
consciousness
in
that
they
did
not
class
together

phenomena
as
varied
as
problem
solving
,
remembering
,
imagining
,

perceiving
,
feeling
pain
,
dreaming
,
and
acting
on
the
grounds
that
all

these
are
manifestations
of
being
aware
or
being
conscious
.

^([28]
:
4
)

Many
philosophers
and
scientists
have
been
unhappy
about
the
difficulty
of
producing
a
definition
that
does
not
involve
circularity
or
fuzziness
.

^([29])
In
The
Macmillan
Dictionary
of
Psychology
(1989
edition)
,
Stuart
Sutherland
emphasized
external
awareness
,
and
expressed
a
skeptical
attitude
more
than
a
definition
:


Consciousness—The
having
of
perceptions
,
thoughts
,
and
feelings
;

awareness
.


The
term
is
impossible
to
define
except
in
terms
that
are

unintelligible
without
a
grasp
of
what
consciousness
means
.


Many
fall

into
the
trap
of
equating
consciousness
with
self-consciousness—to
be

conscious
it
is
only
necessary
to
be
aware
of
the
external
world
.



Consciousness
is
a
fascinating
but
elusive
phenomenon
:
it
is

impossible
to
specify
what
it
is
,
what
it
does
,
or
why
it
has
evolved
.



Nothing
worth
reading
has
been
written
on
it
.

^([29])

Using

'
awareness
'

,
however
,
as
a
definition
or
synonym
of
consciousness
is
not
a
simple
matter
:


If
awareness
of
the
environment
.


.


.


is
the
criterion
of

consciousness
,
then
even
the
protozoans
are
conscious
.


If
awareness
of

awareness
is
required
,
then
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
great
apes
and

human
infants
are
conscious
.

^([26])

Influence
on
research

[edit]

Many
philosophers
have
argued
that
consciousness
is
a
unitary
concept
that
is
understood
by
the
majority
of
people
despite
the
difficulty
philosophers
have
had
defining
it
.

^([30])
Max
Velmans
proposed
that
the
"everyday
understanding
of
consciousness"
uncontroversially
"refers
to
experience
itself
rather
than
any
particular
thing
that
we
observe
or
experience"
and
he
added
that
consciousness
"is
[therefore]
exemplified
by
all
the
things
that
we
observe
or
experience"
,^([31]
:
4
)
whether
thoughts
,
feelings
,
or
perceptions
.


Velmans
noted
however
,
as
of
2009
,
that
there
was
a
deep
level
of
"confusion
and
internal
division"^([31])
among
experts
about
the
phenomenon
of
consciousness
,
because
researchers
lacked
"a
sufficiently
well-specified
use
of
the
term
.


.


.

to
agree
that
they
are
investigating
the
same
thing"
.

^([31]
:
3
)
He
argued
additionally
that
"pre-existing
theoretical
commitments"
to
competing
explanations
of
consciousness
might
be
a
source
of
bias
.



Within
the
"modern
consciousness
studies"
community
the
technical
phrase

'
phenomenal
consciousness
'

is
a
common
synonym
for
all
forms
of
awareness
,
or
simply

'
experience
'

,^([31]
:
4
)
without
differentiating
between
inner
and
outer
,
or
between
higher
and
lower
types
.


With
advances
in
brain
research
,
"the
presence
or
absence
of
experienced
phenomena"^([31]
:
3
)
of
any
kind
underlies
the
work
of
those
neuroscientists
who
seek
"to
analyze
the
precise
relation
of
conscious
phenomenology
to
its
associated
information
processing"
in
the
brain
.

^([31]
:
10
)
This
neuroscientific
goal
is
to
find
the
"neural
correlates
of
consciousness"
(NCC)
.


One
criticism
of
this
goal
is
that
it
begins
with
a
theoretical
commitment
to
the
neurological
origin
of
all
"experienced
phenomena"
whether
inner
or
outer
.

^([c])
Also
,
the
fact
that
the
easiest

'
content
of
consciousness
'

to
be
so
analyzed
is
"the
experienced
three-dimensional
world
(the
phenomenal
world)
beyond
the
body
surface"^([31]
:
4
)
invites
another
criticism
,
that
most
consciousness
research
since
the
1990s
,
perhaps
because
of
bias
,
has
focused
on
processes
of
external
perception
.

^([33])

From
a
history
of
psychology
perspective
,
Julian
Jaynes
rejected
popular
but
"superficial
views
of
consciousness"^([2]
:
447
)
especially
those
which
equate
it
with
"that
vaguest
of
terms
,
experience"
.

^([24]
:
8
)
In
1976
he
insisted
that
if
not
for
introspection
,
which
for
decades
had
been
ignored
or
taken
for
granted
rather
than
explained
,
there
could
be
no
"conception
of
what
consciousness
is"^([24]
:
18
)
and
in
1990
,
he
reaffirmed
the
traditional
idea
of
the
phenomenon
called

'
consciousness
'

,
writing
that
"its
denotative
definition
is
,
as
it
was
for
René
Descartes
,
John
Locke
,
and
David
Hume
,
what
is
introspectable"
.

^([2]
:
450
)
Jaynes
saw
consciousness
as
an
important
but
small
part
of
human
mentality
,
and
he
asserted
:
"there
can
be
no
progress
in
the
science
of
consciousness
until 
.


.


.


what
is
introspectable
[is]
sharply
distinguished"^([2]
:
447
)
from
the
unconscious
processes
of
cognition
such
as
perception
,
reactive
awareness
and
attention
,
and
automatic
forms
of
learning
,
problem-solving
,
and
decision-making
.

^([24]
:
21-47
)

The
cognitive
science
point
of
view—with
an
inter-disciplinary
perspective
involving
fields
such
as
psychology
,
linguistics
and
anthropology^([34])—requires
no
agreed
definition
of
"consciousness"
but
studies
the
interaction
of
many
processes
besides
perception
.


For
some
researchers
,
consciousness
is
linked
to
some
kind
of
"selfhood"
,
for
example
to
certain
pragmatic
issues
such
as
the
feeling
of
agency
and
the
effects
of
regret^([33])
and
action
on
experience
of
one
'
s
own
body
or
social
identity
.

^([35])
Similarly
Daniel
Kahneman
,
who
focused
on
systematic
errors
in
perception
,
memory
and
decision-making
,
has
differentiated
between
two
kinds
of
mental
processes
,
or
cognitive
"systems"
:^([36])
the
"fast"
activities
that
are
primary
,
automatic
and
"cannot
be
turned
off"
,^([36]
:
22
)
and
the
"slow"
,
deliberate
,
effortful
activities
of
a
secondary
system
"often
associated
with
the
subjective
experience
of
agency
,
choice
,
and
concentration"
.

^([36]
:
13
)
Kahneman
'
s
two
systems
have
been
described
as
"roughly
corresponding
to
unconscious
and
conscious
processes"
.

^([37]
:
8
)
The
two
systems
can
interact
,
for
example
in
sharing
the
control
of
attention
.

^([36]
:
22
)
While
System
1
can
be
impulsive
,
"System
2
is
in
charge
of
self-control"
,^([36]
:
26
)
and
"When
we
think
of
ourselves
,
we
identify
with
System
2
,
the
conscious
,
reasoning
self
that
has
beliefs
,
makes
choices
,
and
decides
what
to
think
about
and
what
to
do"
.

^([36]
:
21
)

Some
have
argued
that
we
should
eliminate
the
concept
from
our
understanding
of
the
mind
,
a
position
known
as
consciousness
semanticism
.

^([38])

In
medicine
,
a
"level
of
consciousness"
terminology
is
used
to
describe
a
patient
'
s
arousal
and
responsiveness
,
which
can
be
seen
as
a
continuum
of
states
ranging
from
full
alertness
and
comprehension
,
through
disorientation
,
delirium
,
loss
of
meaningful
communication
,
and
finally
loss
of
movement
in
response
to
painful
stimuli
.

^([39])
Issues
of
practical
concern
include
how
the
level
of
consciousness
can
be
assessed
in
severely
ill
,
comatose
,
or
anesthetized
people
,
and
how
to
treat
conditions
in
which
consciousness
is
impaired
or
disrupted
.

^([40])
The
degree
or
level
of
consciousness
is
measured
by
standardized
behavior
observation
scales
such
as
the
Glasgow
Coma
Scale
.



Philosophy
of
mind

[edit]

While
historically
philosophers
have
defended
various
views
on
consciousness
,
surveys
indicate
that
physicalism
is
now
the
dominant
position
among
contemporary
philosophers
of
mind
.

^([41])
For
an
overview
of
the
field
,
approaches
often
include
both
historical
perspectives
(e
.

g
.


,
Descartes
,
Locke
,
Kant)
and
organization
by
key
issues
in
contemporary
debates
.


An
alternative
is
to
focus
primarily
on
current
philosophical
stances
and
empirical
findings
.



Coherence
of
the
concept

[edit]

Philosophers
differ
from
non-philosophers
in
their
intuitions
about
what
consciousness
is
.

^([42])
While
most
people
have
a
strong
intuition
for
the
existence
of
what
they
refer
to
as
consciousness
,^([30])
skeptics
argue
that
this
intuition
is
too
narrow
,
either
because
the
concept
of
consciousness
is
embedded
in
our
intuitions
,
or
because
we
all
are
illusions
.


Gilbert
Ryle
,
for
example
,
argued
that
traditional
understanding
of
consciousness
depends
on
a
Cartesian
dualist
outlook
that
improperly
distinguishes
between
mind
and
body
,
or
between
mind
and
world
.


He
proposed
that
we
speak
not
of
minds
,
bodies
,
and
the
world
,
but
of
entities
,
or
identities
,
acting
in
the
world
.


Thus
,
by
speaking
of
"consciousness"
we
end
up
leading
ourselves
by
thinking
that
there
is
any
sort
of
thing
as
consciousness
separated
from
behavioral
and
linguistic
understandings
.

^([43])

Types

[edit]

Ned
Block
argued
that
discussions
on
consciousness
often
failed
to
properly
distinguish
phenomenal
(P-consciousness)
from
access
(A-consciousness)
,
though
these
terms
had
been
used
before
Block
.

^([44])
P-consciousness
,
according
to
Block
,
is
raw
experience
:
it
is
moving
,
colored
forms
,
sounds
,
sensations
,
emotions
and
feelings
with
our
bodies
and
responses
at
the
center
.


These
experiences
,
considered
independently
of
any
impact
on
behavior
,
are
called
qualia
.


A-consciousness
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
the
phenomenon
whereby
information
in
our
minds
is
accessible
for
verbal
report
,
reasoning
,
and
the
control
of
behavior
.


So
,
when
we
perceive
,
information
about
what
we
perceive
is
access
conscious
;
when
we
introspect
,
information
about
our
thoughts
is
access
conscious
;
when
we
remember
,
information
about
the
past
is
access
conscious
,
and
so
on
.


Although
some
philosophers
,
such
as
Daniel
Dennett
,
have
disputed
the
validity
of
this
distinction
,^([45])
others
have
broadly
accepted
it
.


David
Chalmers
has
argued
that
A-consciousness
can
in
principle
be
understood
in
mechanistic
terms
,
but
that
understanding
P-consciousness
is
much
more
challenging
:
he
calls
this
the
hard
problem
of
consciousness
.

^([46])

Some
philosophers
believe
that
Block
'
s
two
types
of
consciousness
are
not
the
end
of
the
story
.


William
Lycan
,
for
example
,
argued
in
his
book
Consciousness
and
Experience
that
at
least
eight
clearly
distinct
types
of
consciousness
can
be
identified
(organism
consciousness
;
control
consciousness
;
consciousness
of
;
state/event
consciousness
;
reportability
;
introspective
consciousness
;
subjective
consciousness
;
self-consciousness)—and
that
even
this
list
omits
several
more
obscure
forms
.

^([47])

There
is
also
debate
over
whether
or
not
A-consciousness
and
P-consciousness
always
coexist
or
if
they
can
exist
separately
.


Although
P-consciousness
without
A-consciousness
is
more
widely
accepted
,
there
have
been
some
hypothetical
examples
of
A
without
P
.


Block
,
for
instance
,
suggests
the
case
of
a
"zombie"
that
is
computationally
identical
to
a
person
but
without
any
subjectivity
.


However
,
he
remains
somewhat
skeptical
concluding
"I
don
'
t
know
whether
there
are
any
actual
cases
of
A-consciousness
without
P-consciousness
,
but
I
hope
I
have
illustrated
their
conceptual
possibility"
.

^([48])

Distinguishing
consciousness
from
its
contents

[edit]

Sam
Harris
observes
:
"At
the
level
of
your
experience
,
you
are
not
a
body
of
cells
,
organelles
,
and
atoms
;
you
are
consciousness
and
its
ever-changing
contents"
.

^([49])
Seen
in
this
way
,
consciousness
is
a
subjectively
experienced
,
ever-present
field
in
which
things
(the
contents
of
consciousness)
come
and
go
.



Christopher
Tricker
argues
that
this
field
of
consciousness
is
symbolized
by
the
mythical
bird
that
opens
the
Daoist
classic
the
Zhuangzi
.


This
bird
'
s
name
is
Of
a
Flock
(peng
鵬)
,
yet
its
back
is
countless
thousands
of
miles
across
and
its
wings
are
like
clouds
arcing
across
the
heavens
.


"Like
Of
a
Flock
,
whose
wings
arc
across
the
heavens
,
the
wings
of
your
consciousness
span
to
the
horizon
.


At
the
same
time
,
the
wings
of
every
other
being
'
s
consciousness
span
to
the
horizon
.


You
are
of
a
flock
,
one
bird
among
kin
.

Mind–body
problem

[edit]

Main
article
:
Mind–body
problem

[]

Illustration
of
mind–body
dualism
by
René
Descartes
.


Inputs
are
passed
by
the
sensory
organs
to
the
pineal
gland
,
and
from
there
to
the
immaterial
spirit
.



Mental
processes
(such
as
consciousness)
and
physical
processes
(such
as
brain
events)
seem
to
be
correlated
,
however
the
specific
nature
of
the
connection
is
unknown
.



The
first
influential
philosopher
to
discuss
this
question
specifically
was
Descartes
,
and
the
answer
he
gave
is
known
as
mind–body
dualism
.


Descartes
proposed
that
consciousness
resides
within
an
immaterial
domain
he
called
res
cogitans
(the
realm
of
thought)
,
in
contrast
to
the
domain
of
material
things
,
which
he
called
res
extensa
(the
realm
of
extension)
.

^([51])
He
suggested
that
the
interaction
between
these
two
domains
occurs
inside
the
brain
,
perhaps
in
a
small
midline
structure
called
the
pineal
gland
.

^([52])

Although
it
is
widely
accepted
that
Descartes
explained
the
problem
cogently
,
few
later
philosophers
have
been
happy
with
his
solution
,
and
his
ideas
about
the
pineal
gland
have
especially
been
ridiculed
.

^([53])
However
,
no
alternative
solution
has
gained
general
acceptance
.


Proposed
solutions
can
be
divided
broadly
into
two
categories
:
dualist
solutions
that
maintain
Descartes
'
s
rigid
distinction
between
the
realm
of
consciousness
and
the
realm
of
matter
but
give
different
answers
for
how
the
two
realms
relate
to
each
other
;
and
monist
solutions
that
maintain
that
there
is
really
only
one
realm
of
being
,
of
which
consciousness
and
matter
are
both
aspects
.


Each
of
these
categories
itself
contains
numerous
variants
.


The
two
main
types
of
dualism
are
substance
dualism
(which
holds
that
the
mind
is
formed
of
a
distinct
type
of
substance
not
governed
by
the
laws
of
physics)
,
and
property
dualism
(which
holds
that
the
laws
of
physics
are
universally
valid
but
cannot
be
used
to
explain
the
mind)
.


The
three
main
types
of
monism
are
physicalism
(which
holds
that
the
mind
consists
of
matter
organized
in
a
particular
way)
,
idealism
(which
holds
that
only
thought
or
experience
truly
exists
,
and
matter
is
merely
an
illusion)
,
and
neutral
monism
(which
holds
that
both
mind
and
matter
are
aspects
of
a
distinct
essence
that
is
itself
identical
to
neither
of
them)
.


There
are
also
,
however
,
a
large
number
of
idiosyncratic
theories
that
cannot
cleanly
be
assigned
to
any
of
these
schools
of
thought
.

^([54])

Since
the
dawn
of
Newtonian
science
with
its
vision
of
simple
mechanical
principles
governing
the
entire
universe
,
some
philosophers
have
been
tempted
by
the
idea
that
consciousness
could
be
explained
in
purely
physical
terms
.


The
first
influential
writer
to
propose
such
an
idea
explicitly
was
Julien
Offray
de
La
Mettrie
,
in
his
book
Man
a
Machine
(L
'
homme
machine)
.


His
arguments
,
however
,
were
very
abstract
.

^([55])
The
most
influential
modern
physical
theories
of
consciousness
are
based
on
psychology
and
neuroscience
.


Theories
proposed
by
neuroscientists
such
as
Gerald
Edelman^([56])
and
Antonio
Damasio
,^([57])
and
by
philosophers
such
as
Daniel
Dennett
,^([58])
seek
to
explain
consciousness
in
terms
of
neural
events
occurring
within
the
brain
.


Many
other
neuroscientists
,
such
as
Christof
Koch
,^([59])
have
explored
the
neural
basis
of
consciousness
without
attempting
to
frame
all-encompassing
global
theories
.


At
the
same
time
,
computer
scientists
working
in
the
field
of
artificial
intelligence
have
pursued
the
goal
of
creating
digital
computer
programs
that
can
simulate
or
embody
consciousness
.

^([60])

A
few
theoretical
physicists
have
argued
that
classical
physics
is
intrinsically
incapable
of
explaining
the
holistic
aspects
of
consciousness
,
but
that
quantum
theory
may
provide
the
missing
ingredients
.


Several
theorists
have
therefore
proposed
quantum
mind
(QM)
theories
of
consciousness
.

^([61])
Notable
theories
falling
into
this
category
include
the
holonomic
brain
theory
of
Karl
Pribram
and
David
Bohm
,
and
the
Orch-OR
theory
formulated
by
Stuart
Hameroff
and
Roger
Penrose
.


Some
of
these
QM
theories
offer
descriptions
of
phenomenal
consciousness
,
as
well
as
QM
interpretations
of
access
consciousness
.


None
of
the
quantum
mechanical
theories
have
been
confirmed
by
experiment
.


Recent
publications
by
G
.


Guerreshi
,
J
.


Cia
,
S
.


Popescu
,
and
H
.


Briegel^([62])
could
falsify
proposals
such
as
those
of
Hameroff
,
which
rely
on
quantum
entanglement
in
protein
.


At
the
present
time
many
scientists
and
philosophers
consider
the
arguments
for
an
important
role
of
quantum
phenomena
to
be
unconvincing
.

^([63])
Empirical
evidence
is
against
the
notion
of
quantum
consciousness
,
an
experiment
about
wave
function
collapse
led
by
Catalina
Curceanu
in
2022
suggests
that
quantum
consciousness
,
as
suggested
by
Roger
Penrose
and
Stuart
Hameroff
,
is
highly
implausible
.

^([64])

Apart
from
the
general
question
of
the
"hard
problem"
of
consciousness
(which
is
,
roughly
speaking
,
the
question
of
how
mental
experience
can
arise
from
a
physical
basis^([65]))
,
a
more
specialized
question
is
how
to
square
the
subjective
notion
that
we
are
in
control
of
our
decisions
(at
least
in
some
small
measure)
with
the
customary
view
of
causality
that
subsequent
events
are
caused
by
prior
events
.


The
topic
of
free
will
is
the
philosophical
and
scientific
examination
of
this
conundrum
.

Problem
of
other
minds

Many
philosophers
consider
experience
to
be
the
essence
of
consciousness
,
and
believe
that
experience
can
only
fully
be
known
from
the
inside
,
subjectively
.


The
problem
of
other
minds
is
a
philosophical
problem
traditionally
stated
as
the
following
epistemological
question
:
Given
that
I
can
only
observe
the
behavior
of
others
,
how
can
I
know
that
others
have
minds
?

^([66])
The
problem
of
other
minds
is
particularly
acute
for
people
who
believe
in
the
possibility
of
philosophical
zombies
,
that
is
,
people
who
think
it
is
possible
in
principle
to
have
an
entity
that
is
physically
indistinguishable
from
a
human
being
and
behaves
like
a
human
being
in
every
way
but
nevertheless
lacks
consciousness
.

^([67])
Related
issues
have
also
been
studied
extensively
by
Greg
Littmann
of
the
University
of
Illinois
,^([68])
and
by
Colin
Allen
(a
professor
at
the
University
of
Pittsburgh)
regarding
the
literature
and
research
studying
artificial
intelligence
in
androids
.

^([69])

The
most
commonly
given
answer
is
that
we
attribute
consciousness
to
other
people
because
we
see
that
they
resemble
us
in
appearance
and
behavior
;
we
reason
that
if
they
look
like
us
and
act
like
us
,
they
must
be
like
us
in
other
ways
,
including
having
experiences
of
the
sort
that
we
do
.

^([70])
There
are
,
however
,
a
variety
of
problems
with
that
explanation
.


For
one
thing
,
it
seems
to
violate
the
principle
of
parsimony
,
by
postulating
an
invisible
entity
that
is
not
necessary
to
explain
what
we
observe
.

^([70])
Some
philosophers
,
such
as
Daniel
Dennett
in
a
research
paper
titled
"The
Unimagined
Preposterousness
of
Zombies"
,
argue
that
people
who
give
this
explanation
do
not
really
understand
what
they
are
saying
.

^([71])
More
broadly
,
philosophers
who
do
not
accept
the
possibility
of
zombies
generally
believe
that
consciousness
is
reflected
in
behavior
(including
verbal
behavior)
,
and
that
we
attribute
consciousness
on
the
basis
of
behavior
.


A
more
straightforward
way
of
saying
this
is
that
we
attribute
experiences
to
people
because
of
what
they
can
do
,
including
the
fact
that
they
can
tell
us
about
their
experiences
.

^([72])

Qualia

[edit]

Main
article
:
qualia

The
term
"qualia"
was
introduced
in
philosophical
literature
by
C
.


I
.


Lewis
.


The
word
is
derived
from
Latin
and
means
"of
what
sort"
.


It
is
basically
a
quantity
or
property
of
something
as
perceived
or
experienced
by
an
individual
,
like
the
scent
of
rose
,
the
taste
of
wine
,
or
the
pain
of
a
headache
.


They
are
difficult
to
articulate
or
describe
.


The
philosopher
and
scientist
Daniel
Dennett
describes
them
as
"the
way
things
seem
to
us"
,
while
philosopher
and
cognitive
scientist
David
Chalmers
expanded
on
qualia
as
the
"hard
problem
of
consciousness"
in
the
1990s
.


When
qualia
is
experienced
,
activity
is
simulated
in
the
brain
,
and
these
processes
are
called
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
(NCCs)
.


Many
scientific
studies
have
been
done
to
attempt
to
link
particular
brain
regions
with
emotions
or
experiences
.

^([73][74][75])

Species
which
experience
qualia
are
said
to
have
sentience
,
which
is
central
to
the
animal
rights
movement
,
because
it
includes
the
ability
to
experience
pain
and
suffering
.

^([73])

Scientific
study

[edit]

For
many
decades
,
consciousness
as
a
research
topic
was
avoided
by
the
majority
of
mainstream
scientists
,
because
of
a
general
feeling
that
a
phenomenon
defined
in
subjective
terms
could
not
properly
be
studied
using
objective
experimental
methods
.

^([76])
In
1975
George
Mandler
published
an
influential
psychological
study
which
distinguished
between
slow
,
serial
,
and
limited
conscious
processes
and
fast
,
parallel
and
extensive
unconscious
ones
.

^([77])
The
Science
and
Religion
Forum^([78])
1984
annual
conference
,

'
From
Artificial
Intelligence
to
Human
Consciousness
'

identified
the
nature
of
consciousness
as
a
matter
for
investigation
;
Donald
Michie
was
a
keynote
speaker
.


Starting
in
the
1980s
,
an
expanding
community
of
neuroscientists
and
psychologists
have
associated
themselves
with
a
field
called
Consciousness
Studies
,
giving
rise
to
a
stream
of
experimental
work
published
in
books
,^([79])
journals
such
as
Consciousness
and
Cognition
,
Frontiers
in
Consciousness
Research
,
Psyche
,
and
the
Journal
of
Consciousness
Studies
,
along
with
regular
conferences
organized
by
groups
such
as
the
Association
for
the
Scientific
Study
of
Consciousness^([80])
and
the
Society
for
Consciousness
Studies
.



Modern
medical
and
psychological
investigations
into
consciousness
are
based
on
psychological
experiments
(including
,
for
example
,
the
investigation
of
priming
effects
using
subliminal
stimuli)
,^([81])
and
on
case
studies
of
alterations
in
consciousness
produced
by
trauma
,
illness
,
or
drugs
.


Broadly
viewed
,
scientific
approaches
are
based
on
two
core
concepts
.


The
first
identifies
the
content
of
consciousness
with
the
experiences
that
are
reported
by
human
subjects
;
the
second
makes
use
of
the
concept
of
consciousness
that
has
been
developed
by
neurologists
and
other
medical
professionals
who
deal
with
patients
whose
behavior
is
impaired
.


In
either
case
,
the
ultimate
goals
are
to
develop
techniques
for
assessing
consciousness
objectively
in
humans
as
well
as
other
animals
,
and
to
understand
the
neural
and
psychological
mechanisms
that
underlie
it
.

Measurement
via
verbal
report

[edit]

[]

The
Necker
cube
,
an
ambiguous
image

Experimental
research
on
consciousness
presents
special
difficulties
,
due
to
the
lack
of
a
universally
accepted
operational
definition
.


In
the
majority
of
experiments
that
are
specifically
about
consciousness
,
the
subjects
are
human
,
and
the
criterion
used
is
verbal
report
:
in
other
words
,
subjects
are
asked
to
describe
their
experiences
,
and
their
descriptions
are
treated
as
observations
of
the
contents
of
consciousness
.

^([82])

For
example
,
subjects
who
stare
continuously
at
a
Necker
cube
usually
report
that
they
experience
it
"flipping"
between
two
3D
configurations
,
even
though
the
stimulus
itself
remains
the
same
.

^([83])
The
objective
is
to
understand
the
relationship
between
the
conscious
awareness
of
stimuli
(as
indicated
by
verbal
report)
and
the
effects
the
stimuli
have
on
brain
activity
and
behavior
.


In
several
paradigms
,
such
as
the
technique
of
response
priming
,
the
behavior
of
subjects
is
clearly
influenced
by
stimuli
for
which
they
report
no
awareness
,
and
suitable
experimental
manipulations
can
lead
to
increasing
priming
effects
despite
decreasing
prime
identification
(double
dissociation)
.

^([84])

Verbal
report
is
widely
considered
to
be
the
most
reliable
indicator
of
consciousness
,
but
it
raises
a
number
of
issues
.

^([85])
For
one
thing
,
if
verbal
reports
are
treated
as
observations
,
akin
to
observations
in
other
branches
of
science
,
then
the
possibility
arises
that
they
may
contain
errors—but
it
is
difficult
to
make
sense
of
the
idea
that
subjects
could
be
wrong
about
their
own
experiences
,
and
even
more
difficult
to
see
how
such
an
error
could
be
detected
.

^([86])
Daniel
Dennett
has
argued
for
an
approach
he
calls
heterophenomenology
,
which
means
treating
verbal
reports
as
stories
that
may
or
may
not
be
true
,
but
his
ideas
about
how
to
do
this
have
not
been
widely
adopted
.

^([87])
Another
issue
with
verbal
report
as
a
criterion
is
that
it
restricts
the
field
of
study
to
humans
who
have
language
:
this
approach
cannot
be
used
to
study
consciousness
in
other
species
,
pre-linguistic
children
,
or
people
with
types
of
brain
damage
that
impair
language
.


As
a
third
issue
,
philosophers
who
dispute
the
validity
of
the
Turing
test
may
feel
that
it
is
possible
,
at
least
in
principle
,
for
verbal
report
to
be
dissociated
from
consciousness
entirely
:
a
philosophical
zombie
may
give
detailed
verbal
reports
of
awareness
in
the
absence
of
any
genuine
awareness
.

^([88])

Although
verbal
report
is
in
practice
the
"gold
standard"
for
ascribing
consciousness
,
it
is
not
the
only
possible
criterion
.

^([85])
In
medicine
,
consciousness
is
assessed
as
a
combination
of
verbal
behavior
,
arousal
,
brain
activity
,
and
purposeful
movement
.


The
last
three
of
these
can
be
used
as
indicators
of
consciousness
when
verbal
behavior
is
absent
.

^([89][90])
The
scientific
literature
regarding
the
neural
bases
of
arousal
and
purposeful
movement
is
very
extensive
.


Their
reliability
as
indicators
of
consciousness
is
disputed
,
however
,
due
to
numerous
studies
showing
that
alert
human
subjects
can
be
induced
to
behave
purposefully
in
a
variety
of
ways
in
spite
of
reporting
a
complete
lack
of
awareness
.

^([84])
Studies
related
to
the
neuroscience
of
free
will
have
also
shown
that
the
influence
consciousness
has
on
decision-making
is
not
always
straightforward
.

Mirror
test
and
contingency
awareness

[edit]

[]

Mirror
test
subjected
on
a
common
octopus

See
also
:
Mirror
test

Another
approach
applies
specifically
to
the
study
of
self-awareness
,
that
is
,
the
ability
to
distinguish
oneself
from
others
.


In
the
1970s
Gordon
Gallup
developed
an
operational
test
for
self-awareness
,
known
as
the
mirror
test
.


The
test
examines
whether
animals
are
able
to
differentiate
between
seeing
themselves
in
a
mirror
versus
seeing
other
animals
.


The
classic
example
involves
placing
a
spot
of
coloring
on
the
skin
or
fur
near
the
individual
'
s
forehead
and
seeing
if
they
attempt
to
remove
it
or
at
least
touch
the
spot
,
thus
indicating
that
they
recognize
that
the
individual
they
are
seeing
in
the
mirror
is
themselves
.

^([92])
Humans
(older
than
18
months)
and
other
great
apes
,
bottlenose
dolphins
,
orcas
,
pigeons
,
European
magpies
and
elephants
have
all
been
observed
to
pass
this
test
.

^([93])
While
some
other
animals
like
pigs
have
been
shown
to
find
food
by
looking
into
the
mirror
.

^([94])

Contingency
awareness
is
another
such
approach
,
which
is
basically
the
conscious
understanding
of
one
'
s
actions
and
its
effects
on
one
'
s
environment
.

^([95])
It
is
recognized
as
a
factor
in
self-recognition
.


The
brain
processes
during
contingency
awareness
and
learning
is
believed
to
rely
on
an
intact
medial
temporal
lobe
and
age
.


A
study
done
in
2020
involving
transcranial
direct
current
stimulation
,
Magnetic
resonance
imaging
(MRI)
and
eyeblink
classical
conditioning
supported
the
idea
that
the
parietal
cortex
serves
as
a
substrate
for
contingency
awareness
and
that
age-related
disruption
of
this
region
is
sufficient
to
impair
awareness
.

^([96])

Neural
correlates

[edit]

[]

Schema
of
the
neural
processes
underlying
consciousness
,
from
Christof
Koch

A
major
part
of
the
scientific
literature
on
consciousness
consists
of
studies
that
examine
the
relationship
between
the
experiences
reported
by
subjects
and
the
activity
that
simultaneously
takes
place
in
their
brains—that
is
,
studies
of
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
.


The
hope
is
to
find
that
activity
in
a
particular
part
of
the
brain
,
or
a
particular
pattern
of
global
brain
activity
,
which
will
be
strongly
predictive
of
conscious
awareness
.


Several
brain
imaging
techniques
,
such
as
EEG
and
fMRI
,
have
been
used
for
physical
measures
of
brain
activity
in
these
studies
.

^([97])

Another
idea
that
has
drawn
attention
for
several
decades
is
that
consciousness
is
associated
with
high-frequency
(gamma
band)
oscillations
in
brain
activity
.


This
idea
arose
from
proposals
in
the
1980s
,
by
Christof
von
der
Malsburg
and
Wolf
Singer
,
that
gamma
oscillations
could
solve
the
so-called
binding
problem
,
by
linking
information
represented
in
different
parts
of
the
brain
into
a
unified
experience
.

^([98])
Rodolfo
Llinás
,
for
example
,
proposed
that
consciousness
results
from
recurrent
thalamo-cortical
resonance
where
the
specific
thalamocortical
systems
(content)
and
the
non-specific
(centromedial
thalamus)
thalamocortical
systems
(context)
interact
in
the
gamma
band
frequency
via
synchronous
oscillations
.

^([99])

A
number
of
studies
have
shown
that
activity
in
primary
sensory
areas
of
the
brain
is
not
sufficient
to
produce
consciousness
:
it
is
possible
for
subjects
to
report
a
lack
of
awareness
even
when
areas
such
as
the
primary
visual
cortex
(V1)
show
clear
electrical
responses
to
a
stimulus
.

^([100])
Higher
brain
areas
are
seen
as
more
promising
,
especially
the
prefrontal
cortex
,
which
is
involved
in
a
range
of
higher
cognitive
functions
collectively
known
as
executive
functions
.

^([101])
There
is
substantial
evidence
that
a
"top-down"
flow
of
neural
activity
(i
.

e
.


,
activity
propagating
from
the
frontal
cortex
to
sensory
areas)
is
more
predictive
of
conscious
awareness
than
a
"bottom-up"
flow
of
activity
.

^([102])
The
prefrontal
cortex
is
not
the
only
candidate
area
,
however
:
studies
by
Nikos
Logothetis
and
his
colleagues
have
shown
,
for
example
,
that
visually
responsive
neurons
in
parts
of
the
temporal
lobe
reflect
the
visual
perception
in
the
situation
when
conflicting
visual
images
are
presented
to
different
eyes
(i
.

e
.


,
bistable
percepts
during
binocular
rivalry)
.

^([103])
Furthermore
,
top-down
feedback
from
higher
to
lower
visual
brain
areas
may
be
weaker
or
absent
in
the
peripheral
visual
field
,
as
suggested
by
some
experimental
data
and
theoretical
arguments
;^([104])
nevertheless
humans
can
perceive
visual
inputs
in
the
peripheral
visual
field
arising
from
bottom-up
V1
neural
activities
.

^([104][105])
Meanwhile
,
bottom-up
V1
activities
for
the
central
visual
fields
can
be
vetoed
,
and
thus
made
invisible
to
perception
,
by
the
top-down
feedback
,
when
these
bottom-up
signals
are
inconsistent
with
the
brain
'
s
internal
model
of
the
visual
world
.

^([104][105])

Modulation
of
neural
responses
may
correlate
with
phenomenal
experiences
.


In
contrast
to
the
raw
electrical
responses
that
do
not
correlate
with
consciousness
,
the
modulation
of
these
responses
by
other
stimuli
correlates
surprisingly
well
with
an
important
aspect
of
consciousness
:
namely
with
the
phenomenal
experience
of
stimulus
intensity
(brightness
,
contrast)
.


In
the
research
group
of
Danko
Nikolić
it
has
been
shown
that
some
of
the
changes
in
the
subjectively
perceived
brightness
correlated
with
the
modulation
of
firing
rates
while
others
correlated
with
the
modulation
of
neural
synchrony
.

^([106])
An
fMRI
investigation
suggested
that
these
findings
were
strictly
limited
to
the
primary
visual
areas
.

^([107])
This
indicates
that
,
in
the
primary
visual
areas
,
changes
in
firing
rates
and
synchrony
can
be
considered
as
neural
correlates
of
qualia—at
least
for
some
type
of
qualia
.



In
2013
,
the
perturbational
complexity
index
(PCI)
was
proposed
,
a
measure
of
the
algorithmic
complexity
of
the
electrophysiological
response
of
the
cortex
to
transcranial
magnetic
stimulation
.


This
measure
was
shown
to
be
higher
in
individuals
that
are
awake
,
in
REM
sleep
or
in
a
locked-in
state
than
in
those
who
are
in
deep
sleep
or
in
a
vegetative
state
,^([108])
making
it
potentially
useful
as
a
quantitative
assessment
of
consciousness
states
.



Assuming
that
not
only
humans
but
even
some
non-mammalian
species
are
conscious
,
a
number
of
evolutionary
approaches
to
the
problem
of
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
open
up
.


For
example
,
assuming
that
birds
are
conscious—a
common
assumption
among
neuroscientists
and
ethologists
due
to
the
extensive
cognitive
repertoire
of
birds—there
are
comparative
neuroanatomical
ways
to
validate
some
of
the
principal
,
currently
competing
,
mammalian
consciousness–brain
theories
.


The
rationale
for
such
a
comparative
study
is
that
the
avian
brain
deviates
structurally
from
the
mammalian
brain
.


So
how
similar
are
they
?


What
homologs
can
be
identified
?


The
general
conclusion
from
the
study
by
Butler
,
et
al
.

^([109])
is
that
some
of
the
major
theories
for
the
mammalian
brain^([110][111][112])
also
appear
to
be
valid
for
the
avian
brain
.


The
structures
assumed
to
be
critical
for
consciousness
in
mammalian
brains
have
homologous
counterparts
in
avian
brains
.


Thus
the
main
portions
of
the
theories
of
Crick
and
Koch
,^([110])
Edelman
and
Tononi
,^([111])
and
Cotterill
^([112])
seem
to
be
compatible
with
the
assumption
that
birds
are
conscious
.


Edelman
also
differentiates
between
what
he
calls
primary
consciousness
(which
is
a
trait
shared
by
humans
and
non-human
animals)
and
higher-order
consciousness
as
it
appears
in
humans
alone
along
with
human
language
capacity
.

^([111])
Certain
aspects
of
the
three
theories
,
however
,
seem
less
easy
to
apply
to
the
hypothesis
of
avian
consciousness
.


For
instance
,
the
suggestion
by
Crick
and
Koch
that
layer
5
neurons
of
the
mammalian
brain
have
a
special
role
,
seems
difficult
to
apply
to
the
avian
brain
,
since
the
avian
homologs
have
a
different
morphology
.


Likewise
,
the
theory
of
Eccles^([113][114])
seems
incompatible
,
since
a
structural
homolog/analogue
to
the
dendron
has
not
been
found
in
avian
brains
.


The
assumption
of
an
avian
consciousness
also
brings
the
reptilian
brain
into
focus
.


The
reason
is
the
structural
continuity
between
avian
and
reptilian
brains
,
meaning
that
the
phylogenetic
origin
of
consciousness
may
be
earlier
than
suggested
by
many
leading
neuroscientists
.



Joaquin
Fuster
of
UCLA
has
advocated
the
position
of
the
importance
of
the
prefrontal
cortex
in
humans
,
along
with
the
areas
of
Wernicke
and
Broca
,
as
being
of
particular
importance
to
the
development
of
human
language
capacities
neuro-anatomically
necessary
for
the
emergence
of
higher-order
consciousness
in
humans
.

^([115])

A
study
in
2016
looked
at
lesions
in
specific
areas
of
the
brainstem
that
were
associated
with
coma
and
vegetative
states
.


A
small
region
of
the
rostral
dorsolateral
pontine
tegmentum
in
the
brainstem
was
suggested
to
drive
consciousness
through
functional
connectivity
with
two
cortical
regions
,
the
left
ventral
anterior
insular
cortex
,
and
the
pregenual
anterior
cingulate
cortex
.


These
three
regions
may
work
together
as
a
triad
to
maintain
consciousness
.

Global
workspace
theory

[edit]

Global
workspace
theory
(GWT)
is
a
cognitive
architecture
and
theory
of
consciousness
proposed
by
the
cognitive
psychologist
Bernard
Baars
in
1988
.


Baars
explains
the
theory
with
the
metaphor
of
a
theater
,
with
conscious
processes
represented
by
an
illuminated
stage
.


This
theater
integrates
inputs
from
a
variety
of
unconscious
and
otherwise
autonomous
networks
in
the
brain
and
then
broadcasts
them
to
unconscious
networks
(represented
in
the
metaphor
by
a
broad
,
unlit
"audience")
.


The
theory
has
since
been
expanded
upon
by
other
scientists
including
cognitive
neuroscientist
Stanislas
Dehaene
and
Lionel
Naccache
.

^([120][121])

Integrated
information
theory

[edit]

Integrated
information
theory
(IIT)
,
pioneered
by
neuroscientist
Giulio
Tononi
in
2004
,
postulates
that
consciousness
resides
in
the
information
being
processed
and
arises
once
the
information
reaches
a
certain
level
of
complexity
.


Additionally
,
IIT
is
one
of
the
only
leading
theories
of
consciousness
that
attempts
to
create
a
1
:1
mapping
between
conscious
states
and
precise
,
formal
mathematical
descriptions
of
those
mental
states
.


Proponents
of
this
model
suggest
that
it
may
provide
a
physical
grounding
for
consciousness
in
neurons
,
as
they
provide
the
mechanism
by
which
information
is
integrated
.


This
also
relates
to
the
"hard
problem
of
consciousness"
proposed
by
David
Chalmers
.


The
theory
remains
controversial
,
because
of
its
lack
of
credibility
.

Orchestrated
objective
reduction

[edit]

Orchestrated
objective
reduction
(Orch-OR)
,
or
the
quantum
theory
of
mind
,
was
proposed
by
scientists
Roger
Penrose
and
Stuart
Hameroff
,
and
states
that
consciousness
originates
at
the
quantum
level
inside
neurons
.


The
mechanism
is
held
to
be
a
quantum
process
called
objective
reduction
that
is
orchestrated
by
cellular
structures
called
microtubules
,
which
form
the
cytoskeleton
around
which
the
brain
is
built
.


The
duo
proposed
that
these
quantum
processes
accounted
for
creativity
,
innovation
,
and
problem-solving
abilities
.


Penrose
published
his
views
in
the
book
The
Emperor
'
s
New
Mind
.


In
2014
,
the
discovery
of
quantum
vibrations
inside
microtubules
gave
new
life
to
the
argument
.

Attention
schema
theory

[edit]

In
2011
,
Graziano
and
Kastner^([124])
proposed
the
"attention
schema"
theory
of
awareness
.


In
that
theory
,
specific
cortical
areas
,
notably
in
the
superior
temporal
sulcus
and
the
temporo-parietal
junction
,
are
used
to
build
the
construct
of
awareness
and
attribute
it
to
other
people
.


The
same
cortical
machinery
is
also
used
to
attribute
awareness
to
oneself
.


Damage
to
these
cortical
regions
can
lead
to
deficits
in
consciousness
such
as
hemispatial
neglect
.


In
the
attention
schema
theory
,
the
value
of
explaining
the
feature
of
awareness
and
attributing
it
to
a
person
is
to
gain
a
useful
predictive
model
of
that
person
'
s
attentional
processing
.


Attention
is
a
style
of
information
processing
in
which
a
brain
focuses
its
resources
on
a
limited
set
of
interrelated
signals
.


Awareness
,
in
this
theory
,
is
a
useful
,
simplified
schema
that
represents
attentional
states
.


To
be
aware
of
X
is
explained
by
constructing
a
model
of
one
'
s
attentional
focus
on
X
.



Entropic
brain
theory

[edit]

The
entropic
brain
is
a
theory
of
conscious
states
informed
by
neuroimaging
research
with
psychedelic
drugs
.


The
theory
suggests
that
the
brain
in
primary
states
such
as
rapid
eye
movement
(REM)
sleep
,
early
psychosis
and
under
the
influence
of
psychedelic
drugs
,
is
in
a
disordered
state
;
normal
waking
consciousness
constrains
some
of
this
freedom
and
makes
possible
metacognitive
functions
such
as
internal
self-administered
reality
testing
and
self-awareness
.

^([125][126][127][128])
Criticism
has
included
questioning
whether
the
theory
has
been
adequately
tested
.

^([129])

Projective
consciousness
model

[edit]

In
2017
,
work
by
David
Rudrauf
and
colleagues
,
including
Karl
Friston
,
applied
the
active
inference
paradigm
to
consciousness
,
leading
to
the
projective
consciousness
model
(PCM)
,
a
model
of
how
sensory
data
is
integrated
with
priors
in
a
process
of
projective
transformation
.


The
authors
argue
that
,
while
their
model
identifies
a
key
relationship
between
computation
and
phenomenology
,
it
does
not
completely
solve
the
hard
problem
of
consciousness
or
completely
close
the
explanatory
gap
.

^([130])

Claustrum
being
the
conductor
for
consciousness

[edit]

In
2004
,
a
proposal
was
made
by
molecular
biologist
Francis
Crick
(co-discoverer
of
the
double
helix)
,
which
stated
that
to
bind
together
an
individual
'
s
experience
,
a
conductor
of
an
orchestra
is
required
.


Together
with
neuroscientist
Christof
Koch
,
he
proposed
that
this
conductor
would
have
to
collate
information
rapidly
from
various
regions
of
the
brain
.


The
duo
reckoned
that
the
claustrum
was
well
suited
for
the
task
.


However
,
Crick
died
while
working
on
the
idea
.

^([73])

The
proposal
is
backed
by
a
study
done
in
2014
,
where
a
team
at
the
George
Washington
University
induced
unconsciousness
in
a
54-year-old
woman
suffering
from
intractable
epilepsy
by
stimulating
her
claustrum
.


The
woman
underwent
depth
electrode
implantation
and
electrical
stimulation
mapping
.


The
electrode
between
the
left
claustrum
and
anterior-dorsal
insula
was
the
one
which
induced
unconsciousness
.


Correlation
for
interactions
affecting
medial
parietal
and
posterior
frontal
channels
during
stimulation
increased
significantly
as
well
.


Their
findings
suggested
that
the
left
claustrum
or
anterior
insula
is
an
important
part
of
a
network
that
subserves
consciousness
,
and
that
disruption
of
consciousness
is
related
to
increased
EEG
signal
synchrony
within
frontal-parietal
networks
.


However
,
this
remains
an
isolated
,
hence
inconclusive
study
.

Biological
function
and
evolution

[edit]

The
emergence
of
consciousness
during
biological
evolution
remains
a
topic
of
ongoing
scientific
inquiry
.


The
survival
value
of
consciousness
is
still
a
matter
of
exploration
and
understanding
.


While
consciousness
appears
to
play
a
crucial
role
in
human
cognition
,
decision-making
,
and
self-awareness
,
its
adaptive
significance
across
different
species
remains
a
subject
of
debate
.



Some
people
question
whether
consciousness
has
any
survival
value
.


Some
argue
that
consciousness
is
a
by-product
of
evolution
.


Thomas
Henry
Huxley
for
example
defends
in
an
essay
titled
"On
the
Hypothesis
that
Animals
are
Automata
,
and
its
History"
an
epiphenomenalist
theory
of
consciousness
,
according
to
which
consciousness
is
a
causally
inert
effect
of
neural
activity—"as
the
steam-whistle
which
accompanies
the
work
of
a
locomotive
engine
is
without
influence
upon
its
machinery"
.

^([132])
To
this
William
James
objects
in
his
essay
Are
We
Automata
?


by
stating
an
evolutionary
argument
for
mind-brain
interaction
implying
that
if
the
preservation
and
development
of
consciousness
in
the
biological
evolution
is
a
result
of
natural
selection
,
it
is
plausible
that
consciousness
has
not
only
been
influenced
by
neural
processes
,
but
has
had
a
survival
value
itself
;
and
it
could
only
have
had
this
if
it
had
been
efficacious
.

^([133][134])
Karl
Popper
develops
a
similar
evolutionary
argument
in
the
book
The
Self
and
Its
Brain
.

^([135])

Opinions
are
divided
on
when
and
how
consciousness
first
arose
.


It
has
been
argued
that
consciousness
emerged
(i)
exclusively
with
the
first
humans
,
(ii)
exclusively
with
the
first
mammals
,
(iii)
independently
in
mammals
and
birds
,
or
(iv)
with
the
first
reptiles
.

^([136])
Other
authors
date
the
origins
of
consciousness
to
the
first
animals
with
nervous
systems
or
early
vertebrates
in
the
Cambrian
over
500
million
years
ago
.

^([137])
Donald
Griffin
suggests
in
his
book
Animal
Minds
a
gradual
evolution
of
consciousness
.

^([138])
Further
exploration
of
the
origins
of
consciousness
,
particularly
in
molluscs
,
has
been
done
by
Peter
Godfrey
Smith
in
his
book
Metazoa
.

^([139])

Regarding
the
primary
function
of
conscious
processing
,
a
recurring
idea
in
recent
theories
is
that
phenomenal
states
somehow
integrate
neural
activities
and
information-processing
that
would
otherwise
be
independent
.

^([140])
This
has
been
called
the
integration
consensus
.


Another
example
has
been
proposed
by
Gerald
Edelman
called
dynamic
core
hypothesis
which
puts
emphasis
on
reentrant
connections
that
reciprocally
link
areas
of
the
brain
in
a
massively
parallel
manner
.

^([141])
Edelman
also
stresses
the
importance
of
the
evolutionary
emergence
of
higher-order
consciousness
in
humans
from
the
historically
older
trait
of
primary
consciousness
which
humans
share
with
non-human
animals
(see
Neural
correlates
section
above)
.


These
theories
of
integrative
function
present
solutions
to
two
classic
problems
associated
with
consciousness
:
differentiation
and
unity
.


They
show
how
our
conscious
experience
can
discriminate
between
a
virtually
unlimited
number
of
different
possible
scenes
and
details
(differentiation)
because
it
integrates
those
details
from
our
sensory
systems
,
while
the
integrative
nature
of
consciousness
in
this
view
easily
explains
how
our
experience
can
seem
unified
as
one
whole
despite
all
of
these
individual
parts
.


However
,
it
remains
unspecified
which
kinds
of
information
are
integrated
in
a
conscious
manner
and
which
kinds
can
be
integrated
without
consciousness
.


Nor
is
it
explained
what
specific
causal
role
conscious
integration
plays
,
nor
why
the
same
functionality
cannot
be
achieved
without
consciousness
.


Not
all
kinds
of
information
are
capable
of
being
disseminated
consciously
(e
.

g
.


,
neural
activity
related
to
vegetative
functions
,
reflexes
,
unconscious
motor
programs
,
low-level
perceptual
analyzes
,
etc
.

)
,
and
many
kinds
of
information
can
be
disseminated
and
combined
with
other
kinds
without
consciousness
,
as
in
intersensory
interactions
such
as
the
ventriloquism
effect
.

^([142])
Hence
it
remains
unclear
why
any
of
it
is
conscious
.


For
a
review
of
the
differences
between
conscious
and
unconscious
integrations
,
see
the
article
of
Ezequiel
Morsella
.

^([142])

As
noted
earlier
,
even
among
writers
who
consider
consciousness
to
be
well-defined
,
there
is
widespread
dispute
about
which
animals
other
than
humans
can
be
said
to
possess
it
.

^([143])
Edelman
has
described
this
distinction
as
that
of
humans
possessing
higher-order
consciousness
while
sharing
the
trait
of
primary
consciousness
with
non-human
animals
(see
previous
paragraph)
.


Thus
,
any
examination
of
the
evolution
of
consciousness
is
faced
with
great
difficulties
.


Nevertheless
,
some
writers
have
argued
that
consciousness
can
be
viewed
from
the
standpoint
of
evolutionary
biology
as
an
adaptation
in
the
sense
of
a
trait
that
increases
fitness
.

^([144])
In
his
article
"Evolution
of
consciousness"
,
John
Eccles
argued
that
special
anatomical
and
physical
properties
of
the
mammalian
cerebral
cortex
gave
rise
to
consciousness
("[a]
psychon

.


.


.


linked
to
[a]
dendron
through
quantum
physics")
.

^([145])
Bernard
Baars
proposed
that
once
in
place
,
this
"recursive"
circuitry
may
have
provided
a
basis
for
the
subsequent
development
of
many
of
the
functions
that
consciousness
facilitates
in
higher
organisms
.

^([146])
Peter
Carruthers
has
put
forth
one
such
potential
adaptive
advantage
gained
by
conscious
creatures
by
suggesting
that
consciousness
allows
an
individual
to
make
distinctions
between
appearance
and
reality
.

^([147])
This
ability
would
enable
a
creature
to
recognize
the
likelihood
that
their
perceptions
are
deceiving
them
(e
.

g
.


that
water
in
the
distance
may
be
a
mirage)
and
behave
accordingly
,
and
it
could
also
facilitate
the
manipulation
of
others
by
recognizing
how
things
appear
to
them
for
both
cooperative
and
devious
ends
.



Other
philosophers
,
however
,
have
suggested
that
consciousness
would
not
be
necessary
for
any
functional
advantage
in
evolutionary
processes
.

^([148][149])
No
one
has
given
a
causal
explanation
,
they
argue
,
of
why
it
would
not
be
possible
for
a
functionally
equivalent
non-conscious
organism
(i
.

e
.


,
a
philosophical
zombie)
to
achieve
the
very
same
survival
advantages
as
a
conscious
organism
.


If
evolutionary
processes
are
blind
to
the
difference
between
function
F
being
performed
by
conscious
organism
O
and
non-conscious
organism
O*
,
it
is
unclear
what
adaptive
advantage
consciousness
could
provide
.

^([150])
As
a
result
,
an
exaptive
explanation
of
consciousness
has
gained
favor
with
some
theorists
that
posit
consciousness
did
not
evolve
as
an
adaptation
but
was
an
exaptation
arising
as
a
consequence
of
other
developments
such
as
increases
in
brain
size
or
cortical
rearrangement
.

^([137])
Consciousness
in
this
sense
has
been
compared
to
the
blind
spot
in
the
retina
where
it
is
not
an
adaption
of
the
retina
,
but
instead
just
a
by-product
of
the
way
the
retinal
axons
were
wired
.

^([151])
Several
scholars
including
Pinker
,
Chomsky
,
Edelman
,
and
Luria
have
indicated
the
importance
of
the
emergence
of
human
language
as

:
Altered
state
of
consciousness

There
are
some
brain
states
in
which
consciousness
seems
to
be
absent
,
including
dreamless
sleep
or
coma
.


There
are
also
a
variety
of
circumstances
that
can
change
the
relationship
between
the
mind
and
the
world
in
less
drastic
ways
,
producing
what
are
known
as
altered
states
of
consciousness
.


Some
altered
states
occur
naturally
;
others
can
be
produced
by
drugs
or
brain
damage
.

^([152])
Altered
states
can
be
accompanied
by
changes
in
thinking
,
disturbances
in
the
sense
of
time
,
feelings
of
loss
of
control
,
changes
in
emotional
expression
,
alternations
in
body
image
and
changes
in
meaning
or
significance
.

^([153])

The
two
most
widely
accepted
altered
states
are
sleep
and
dreaming
.


Although
dream
sleep
and
non-dream
sleep
appear
very
similar
to
an
outside
observer
,
each
is
associated
with
a
distinct
pattern
of
brain
activity
,
metabolic
activity
,
and
eye
movement
;
each
is
also
associated
with
a
distinct
pattern
of
experience
and
cognition
.


During
ordinary
non-dream
sleep
,
people
who
are
awakened
report
only
vague
and
sketchy
thoughts
,
and
their
experiences
do
not
cohere
into
a
continuous
narrative
.


During
dream
sleep
,
in
contrast
,
people
who
are
awakened
report
rich
and
detailed
experiences
in
which
events
form
a
continuous
progression
,
which
may
however
be
interrupted
by
bizarre
or
fantastic
intrusions
.

^([154][failed
verification])
Thought
processes
during
the
dream
state
frequently
show
a
high
level
of
irrationality
.


Both
dream
and
non-dream
states
are
associated
with
severe
disruption
of
memory
:
it
usually
disappears
in
seconds
during
the
non-dream
state
,
and
in
minutes
after
awakening
from
a
dream
unless
actively
refreshed
.

^([155])

Research
conducted
on
the
effects
of
partial
epileptic
seizures
on
consciousness
found
that
patients
who
have
partial
epileptic
seizures
experience
altered
states
of
consciousness
.

^([156][157])
In
partial
epileptic
seizures
,
consciousness
is
impaired
or
lost
while
some
aspects
of
consciousness
,
often
automated
behaviors
,
remain
intact
.


Studies
found
that
when
measuring
the
qualitative
features
during
partial
epileptic
seizures
,
patients
exhibited
an
increase
in
arousal
and
became
absorbed
in
the
experience
of
the
seizure
,
followed
by
difficulty
in
focusing
and
shifting
attention
.



A
variety
of
psychoactive
drugs
,
including
alcohol
,
have
notable
effects
on
consciousness
.

^([158])
These
range
from
a
simple
dulling
of
awareness
produced
by
sedatives
,
to
increases
in
the
intensity
of
sensory
qualities
produced
by
stimulants
,
cannabis
,
empathogens–entactogens
such
as
MDMA
("Ecstasy")
,
or
most
notably
by
the
class
of
drugs
known
as
psychedelics
.

^([152])
LSD
,
mescaline
,
psilocybin
,
dimethyltryptamine
,
and
others
in
this
group
can
produce
major
distortions
of
perception
,
including
hallucinations
;
some
users
even
describe
their
drug-induced
experiences
as
mystical
or
spiritual
in
quality
.


The
brain
mechanisms
underlying
these
effects
are
not
as
well
understood
as
those
induced
by
use
of
alcohol
,^([158])
but
there
is
substantial
evidence
that
alterations
in
the
brain
system
that
uses
the
chemical
neurotransmitter
serotonin
play
an
essential
role
.

^([159])

There
has
been
some
research
into
physiological
changes
in
yogis
and
people
who
practise
various
techniques
of
meditation
.


Some
research
with
brain
waves
during
meditation
has
reported
differences
between
those
corresponding
to
ordinary
relaxation
and
those
corresponding
to
meditation
.


It
has
been
disputed
,
however
,
whether
there
is
enough
evidence
to
count
these
as
physiologically
distinct
states
of
consciousness
.

^([160])

The
most
extensive
study
of
the
characteristics
of
altered
states
of
consciousness
was
made
by
psychologist
Charles
Tart
in
the
1960s
and
1970s
.


Tart
analyzed
a
state
of
consciousness
as
made
up
of
a
number
of
component
processes
,
including
exteroception
(sensing
the
external
world)
;
interoception
(sensing
the
body)
;
input-processing
(seeing
meaning)
;
emotions
;
memory
;
time
sense
;
sense
of
identity
;
evaluation
and
cognitive
processing
;
motor
output
;
and
interaction
with
the
environment
.

^([161][self-published
source])
Each
of
these
,
in
his
view
,
could
be
altered
in
multiple
ways
by
drugs
or
other
manipulations
.


The
components
that
Tart
identified
have
not
,
however
,
been
validated
by
empirical
studies
.


Research
in
this
area
has
not
yet
reached
firm
conclusions
,
but
a
recent
questionnaire-based
study
identified
eleven
significant
factors
contributing
to
drug-induced
states
of
consciousness
:
experience
of
unity
;
spiritual
experience
;
blissful
state
;
insightfulness
;
disembodiment
;
impaired
control
and
cognition
;
anxiety
;
complex
imagery
;
elementary
imagery
;
audio-visual
synesthesia
;
and
changed
meaning
of
percepts
.

Medical
aspects

[edit]

The
medical
approach
to
consciousness
is
scientifically
oriented
.


It
derives
from
a
need
to
treat
people
whose
brain
function
has
been
impaired
as
a
result
of
disease
,
brain
damage
,
toxins
,
or
drugs
.


In
medicine
,
conceptual
distinctions
are
considered
useful
to
the
degree
that
they
can
help
to
guide
treatments
.


The
medical
approach
focuses
mostly
on
the
amount
of
consciousness
a
person
has
:
in
medicine
,
consciousness
is
assessed
as
a
"level"
ranging
from
coma
and
brain
death
at
the
low
end
,
to
full
alertness
and
purposeful
responsiveness
at
the
high
end
.

^([163])

Consciousness
is
of
concern
to
patients
and
physicians
,
especially
neurologists
and
anesthesiologists
.


Patients
may
have
disorders
of
consciousness
or
may
need
to
be
anesthetized
for
a
surgical
procedure
.


Physicians
may
perform
consciousness-related
interventions
such
as
instructing
the
patient
to
sleep
,
administering
general
anesthesia
,
or
inducing
medical
coma
.

^([163])
Also
,
bioethicists
may
be
concerned
with
the
ethical
implications
of
consciousness
in
medical
cases
of
patients
such
as
the
Karen
Ann
Quinlan
case
,^([164])
while
neuroscientists
may
study
patients
with
impaired
consciousness
in
hopes
of
gaining
information
about
how
the
brain
works
.

^([165])

Assessment

[edit]

In
medicine
,
consciousness
is
examined
using
a
set
of
procedures
known
as
neuropsychological
assessment
.

^([89])
There
are
two
commonly
used
methods
for
assessing
the
level
of
consciousness
of
a
patient
:
a
simple
procedure
that
requires
minimal
training
,
and
a
more
complex
procedure
that
requires
substantial
expertise
.


The
simple
procedure
begins
by
asking
whether
the
patient
is
able
to
move
and
react
to
physical
stimuli
.


If
so
,
the
next
question
is
whether
the
patient
can
respond
in
a
meaningful
way
to
questions
and
commands
.


If
so
,
the
patient
is
asked
for
name
,
current
location
,
and
current
day
and
time
.


A
patient
who
can
answer
all
of
these
questions
is
said
to
be
"alert
and
oriented
times
four"
(sometimes
denoted
"A&Ox4"
on
a
medical
chart)
,
and
is
usually
considered
fully
conscious
.

^([166])

The
more
complex
procedure
is
known
as
a
neurological
examination
,
and
is
usually
carried
out
by
a
neurologist
in
a
hospital
setting
.


A
formal
neurological
examination
runs
through
a
precisely
delineated
series
of
tests
,
beginning
with
tests
for
basic
sensorimotor
reflexes
,
and
culminating
with
tests
for
sophisticated
use
of
language
.


The
outcome
may
be
summarized
using
the
Glasgow
Coma
Scale
,
which
yields
a
number
in
the
range
3–15
,
with
a
score
of
3
to
8
indicating
coma
,
and
15
indicating
full
consciousness
.


The
Glasgow
Coma
Scale
has
three
subscales
,
measuring
the
best
motor
response
(ranging
from
"no
motor
response"
to
"obeys
commands")
,
the
best
eye
response
(ranging
from
"no
eye
opening"
to
"eyes
opening
spontaneously")
and
the
best
verbal
response
(ranging
from
"no
verbal
response"
to
"fully
oriented")
.


There
is
also
a
simpler
pediatric
version
of
the
scale
,
for
children
too
young
to
be
able
to
use
language
.

^([163])

In
2013
,
an
experimental
procedure
was
developed
to
measure
degrees
of
consciousness
,
the
procedure
involving
stimulating
the
brain
with
a
magnetic
pulse
,
measuring
resulting
waves
of
electrical
activity
,
and
developing
a
consciousness
score
based
on
the
complexity
of
the
brain
activity
.

^([167])

Disorders

[edit]

Medical
conditions
that
inhibit
consciousness
are
considered
disorders
of
consciousness
.

^([168])
This
category
generally
includes
minimally
conscious
state
and
persistent
vegetative
state
,
but
sometimes
also
includes
the
less
severe
locked-in
syndrome
and
more
severe
chronic
coma
.

^([168][169])
Differential
diagnosis
of
these
disorders
is
an
active
area
of
biomedical
research
.

^([170][171][172])
Finally
,
brain
death
results
in
possible
irreversible
disruption
of
consciousness
.

^([168])
While
other
conditions
may
cause
a
moderate
deterioration
(e
.

g
.


,
dementia
and
delirium)
or
transient
interruption
(e
.

g
.


,
grand
mal
and
petit
mal
seizures)
of
consciousness
,
they
are
not
included
in
this
category
.

,
but
is

-----------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Medical
experts
increasingly
view
anosognosia
as
a
disorder
of
consciousness
.

^([173])
Anosognosia
is
a
Greek-derived
term
meaning
"unawareness
of
disease"
.


This
is
a
condition
in
which
patients
are
disabled
in
some
way
,
most
commonly
as
a
result
of
a
stroke
,
but
either
misunderstand
the
nature
of
the
problem
or
deny
that
there
is
anything
wrong
with
them
.

^([174])
The
most
frequently
occurring
form
is
seen
in
people
who
have
experienced
a
stroke
damaging
the
parietal
lobe
in
the
right
hemisphere
of
the
brain
,
giving
rise
to
a
syndrome
known
as
hemispatial
neglect
,
characterized
by
an
inability
to
direct
action
or
attention
toward
objects
located
to
the
left
with
respect
to
their
bodies
.


Patients
with
hemispatial
neglect
are
often
paralyzed
on
the
left
side
of
the
body
,
but
sometimes
deny
being
unable
to
move
.


When
questioned
about
the
obvious
problem
,
the
patient
may
avoid
giving
a
direct
answer
,
or
may
give
an
explanation
that
does
not
make
sense
.


Patients
with
hemispatial
neglect
may
also
fail
to
recognize
paralyzed
parts
of
their
bodies
:
one
frequently
mentioned
case
is
of
a
man
who
repeatedly
tried
to
throw
his
own
paralyzed
right
leg
out
of
the
bed
he
was
lying
in
,
and
when
asked
what
he
was
doing
,
complained
that
somebody
had
put
a
dead
leg
into
the
bed
with
him
.


An
even
more
striking
type
of
anosognosia
is
Anton–Babinski
syndrome
,
a
rarely
occurring
condition
in
which
patients
become
blind
but
claim
to
be
able
to
see
normally
,
and
persist
in
this
claim
in
spite
of
all
evidence
to
the
contrary
.

Theory
of
mind

Of
the
eight
types
of
consciousness
in
the
Lycan
classification
,
some
are
detectable
in
utero
and
others
develop
years
after
birth
.


Psychologist
and
educator
William
Foulkes
studied
children
'
s
dreams
and
concluded
that
prior
to
the
shift
in
cognitive
maturation
that
humans
experience
during
ages
five
to
seven
,^([176])
children
lack
the
Lockean
consciousness
that
Lycan
had
labeled
"introspective
consciousness"
and
that
Foulkes
labels
"self-reflection"
.

^([177])
In
a
2020
paper
,
Katherine
Nelson
and
Robyn
Fivush
use
"autobiographical
consciousness"
to
label
essentially
the
same
faculty
,
and
agree
with
Foulkes
on
the
timing
of
this
faculty
'
s
acquisition
.


Nelson
and
Fivush
contend
that
"language
is
the
tool
by
which
humans
create
a
new
,
uniquely
human
form
of
consciousness
,
namely
,
autobiographical
consciousness"
.

^([178])
Julian
Jaynes
had
staked
out
these
positions
decades
earlier
.

^([179][180])
Citing
the
developmental
steps
that
lead
the
infant
to
autobiographical
consciousness
,
Nelson
and
Fivush
point
to
the
acquisition
of
"theory
of
mind"
,
calling
theory
of
mind
"necessary
for
autobiographical
consciousness"
and
defining
it
as
"understanding
differences
between
one
'
s
own
mind
and
others
'

minds
in
terms
of
beliefs
,
desires
,
emotions
and
thoughts"
.


They
write
,
"The
hallmark
of
theory
of

,
the
understanding
of
false
belief
,
occurs
.

at

In

[edit]

Main
article
:
Animal
consciousness

The
topic
of
animal
consciousness
is
beset
by
a
number
of
difficulties
.


It
poses
the
problem
of
other
minds
in
an
especially
severe
form
,
because
non-human
animals
,
lacking
the
ability
to
express
human
language
,
cannot
tell
humans
about
their
experiences
.

^([182])
Also
,
it
is
difficult
to
reason
objectively
about
the
question
,
because
a
denial
that
an
animal
is
conscious
is
often
taken
to
imply
that
it
does
not
feel
,
its
life
has
no
value
,
and
that
harming
it
is
not
morally
wrong
.


Descartes
,
for
example
,
has
sometimes
been
blamed
for
mistreatment
of
animals
due
to
the
fact
that
he
believed
only
humans
have
a
non-physical
mind
.

^([183])
Most
people
have
a
strong
intuition
that
some
animals
,
such
as
cats
and
dogs
,
are
conscious
,
while
others
,
such
as
insects
,
are
not
;
but
the
sources
of
this
intuition
are
not
obvious
,
and
are
often
based
on
personal
interactions
with
pets
and
other
animals
they
have
observed
.

^([182])

Thomas
Nagel
argues
that
while
a
human
might
be
able
to
imagine
what
it
is
like
to
be
a
bat
by
taking
"the
bat
'
s
point
of
view"
,
it
would
still
be
impossible
"to
know
what
it
is
like
for
a
bat
to
be
a
bat"
.


(Townsend
'
s
big-eared
bat
pictured
.

)

Philosophers
who
consider
subjective
experience
the
essence
of
consciousness
also
generally
believe
,
as
a
correlate
,
that
the
existence
and
nature
of
animal
consciousness
can
never
rigorously
be
known
.


Thomas
Nagel
spelled
out
this
point
of
view
in
an
influential
essay
titled
"What
Is
it
Like
to
Be
a
Bat
?

"
.


He
said
that
an
organism
is
conscious
"if
and
only
if
there
is
something
that
it
is
like
to
be
that
organism—something
it
is
like
for
the
organism"
;
and
he
argued
that
no
matter
how
much
we
know
about
an
animal
'
s
brain
and
behavior
,
we
can
never
really
put
ourselves
into
the
mind
of
the
animal
and
experience
its
world
in
the
way
it
does
itself
.

^([184])
Other
thinkers
,
such
as
Douglas
Hofstadter
,
dismiss
this
argument
as
incoherent
.

^([185])
Several
psychologists
and
ethologists
have
argued
for
the
existence
of
animal
consciousness
by
describing
a
range
of
behaviors
that
appear
to
show
animals
holding
beliefs
about
things
they
cannot
directly
perceive—Donald
Griffin
'
s
2001
book
Animal
Minds
reviews
a
substantial
portion
of
the
evidence
.

On
July
7
,
2012
,
eminent
scientists
from
different
branches
of
neuroscience
gathered
at
the
University
of
Cambridge
to
celebrate
the
Francis
Crick
Memorial
Conference
,
which
deals
with
consciousness

article
:
Artificial
consciousness

The
idea
of
an
artifact
made
conscious
is
an
ancient
theme
of
mythology
,
appearing
for
example
in
the
Greek
myth
of
Pygmalion
,
who
carved
a
statue
that
was
magically
brought
to
life
,
and
in
medieval
Jewish
stories
of
the
Golem
,
a
magically
animated
homunculus
built
of
clay
.

^([188])
However
,
the
possibility
of
actually
constructing
a
conscious
machine
was
probably
first
discussed
by
Ada
Lovelace
,
in
a
set
of
notes
written
in
1842
about
the
Analytical
Engine
invented
by
Charles
Babbage
,
a
precursor
(never
built)
to
modern
electronic
computers
.


Lovelace
was
essentially
dismissive
of
the
idea
that
a
machine
such
as
the
Analytical
Engine
could
think
in
a
humanlike
way
.


She
wrote
:


It
is
desirable
to
guard
against
the
possibility
of
exaggerated
ideas

that
might
arise
as
to
the
powers
of
the
Analytical
Engine
.

 
.


.


.


The

Analytical
Engine
has
no
pretensions
whatever
to
originate
anything
.



It
can
do
whatever
we
know
how
to
order
it
to
perform
.


It
can
follow

analysis
;
but
it
has
no
power
of
anticipating
any
analytical
relations

or
truths
.


Its
province
is
to
assist
us
in
making
available
what
we

are
already
acquainted
with
.

^([189])

One
of
the
most
influential
contributions
to
this
question
was
an
essay
written
in
1950
by
pioneering
computer
scientist
Alan
Turing
,
titled
Computing
Machinery
and
Intelligence
.


Turing
disavowed
any
interest
in
terminology
,
saying
that
even
"Can
machines
think
?

"
is
too
loaded
with
spurious
connotations
to
be
meaningful
;
but
he
proposed
to
replace
all
such
questions
with
a
specific
operational
test
,
which
has
become
known
as
the
Turing
test
.

^([190])
To
pass
the
test
,
a
computer
must
be
able
to
imitate
a
human
well
enough
to
fool
interrogators
.


In
his
essay
Turing
discussed
a
variety
of
possible
objections
,
and
presented
a
counterargument
to
each
of
them
.


The
Turing
test
is
commonly
cited
in
discussions
of
artificial
intelligence
as
a
proposed
criterion
for
machine
consciousness
;
it
has
provoked
a
great
deal
of
philosophical
debate
.


For
example
,
Daniel
Dennett
and
Douglas
Hofstadter
argue
that
anything
capable
of
passing
the
Turing
test
is
necessarily
conscious
,^([191])
while
David
Chalmers
argues
that
a
philosophical
zombie
could
pass
the
test
,
yet
fail
to
be
conscious
.

^([192])
A
third
group
of
scholars
have
argued
that
with
technological
growth
once
machines
begin
to
display
any
substantial
signs
of
human-like
behavior
then
the
dichotomy
(of
human
consciousness
compared
to
human-like
consciousness)
becomes
passé
and
issues
of
machine
autonomy
begin
to
prevail
even
as
observed
in
its
nascent
form
within
contemporary
industry
and
technology
.

^([68][69])
Jürgen
Schmidhuber
argues
that
consciousness
is
the
result
of
compression
.

^([193])
As
an
agent
sees
representation
of
itself
recurring
in
the
environment
,
the
compression
of
this
representation
can
be
called
consciousness
.

John
Searle
in
December
2005

In
a
lively
exchange
over
what
has
come
to
be
referred
to
as
"the
Chinese
room
argument"
,
John
Searle
sought
to
refute
the
claim
of
proponents
of
what
he
calls
"strong
artificial
intelligence
(AI)"
that
a
computer
program
can
be
conscious
,
though
he
does
agree
with
advocates
of
"weak
AI"
that
computer
programs
can
be
formatted
to
"simulate"
conscious
states
.


His
own
view
is
that
consciousness
has
subjective
,
first-person
causal
powers
by
being
essentially
intentional
due
to
the
way
human
brains
function
biologically
;
conscious
persons
can
perform
computations
,
but
consciousness
is
not
inherently
computational
the
way
computer
programs
are
.


To
make
a
Turing
machine
that
speaks
Chinese
,
Searle
imagines
a
room
with
one
monolingual
English
speaker
(Searle
himself
,
in
fact)
,
a
book
that
designates
a
combination
of
Chinese
symbols
to
be
output
paired
with
Chinese
symbol
input
,
and
boxes
filled
with
Chinese
symbols
.


In
this
case
,
the
English
speaker
is
acting
as
a
computer
and
the
rulebook
as
a
program
.


Searle
argues
that
with
such
a
machine
,
he
would
be
able
to
process
the
inputs
to
outputs
perfectly
without
having
any
understanding
of
Chinese
,
nor
having
any
idea
what
the
questions
and
answers
could
possibly
mean
.


If
the
experiment
were
done
in
English
,
since
Searle
knows
English
,
he
would
be
able
to
take
questions
and
give
answers
without
any
algorithms
for
English
questions
,
and
he
would
be
effectively
aware
of
what
was
being
said
and
the
purposes
it
might
serve
.


Searle
would
pass
the
Turing
test
of
answering
the
questions
in
both
languages
,
but
he
is
only
conscious
of
what
he
is
doing
when
he
speaks
English
.


Another
way
of
putting
the
argument
is
to
say
that
computer
programs
can
pass
the
Turing
test
for
processing
the
syntax
of
a
language
,
but
that
the
syntax
cannot
lead
to
semantic
meaning
in
the
way
strong
AI
advocates
hoped
.

^([194][195])

In
the
literature
concerning
artificial
intelligence
,
Searle
'
s
essay
has
been
second
only
to
Turing
'
s
in
the
volume
of
debate
it
has
generated
.

^([196])
Searle
himself
was
vague
about
what
extra
ingredients
it
would
take
to
make
a
machine
conscious
:
all
he
proposed
was
that
what
was
needed
was
"causal
powers"
of
the
sort
that
the
brain
has
and
that
computers
lack
.


But
other
thinkers
sympathetic
to
his
basic
argument
have
suggested
that
the
necessary
(though
perhaps
still
not
sufficient)
extra
conditions
may
include
the
ability
to
pass
not
just
the
verbal
version
of
the
Turing
test
,
but
the
robotic
version
,^([197])
which
requires
grounding
the
robot
'
s
words
in
the
robot
'
s
sensorimotor
capacity
to
categorize
and
interact
with
the
things
in
the
world
that
its
words
are
about
,
Turing-indistinguishably
from
a
real
person
.


Turing-scale
robotics
is
an
empirical
branch
of
research
on
embodied
cognition
and
situated
cognition
.

^([198])

In
2014
,
Victor
Argonov
has
suggested
a
non-Turing
test
for
machine
consciousness
based
on
a
machine
'
s
ability
to
produce
philosophical
judgments
.

^([199])
He
argues
that
a
deterministic
machine
must
be
regarded
as
conscious
if
it
is
able
to
produce
judgments
on
all
problematic
properties
of
consciousness
(such
as
qualia
or
binding)
having
no
innate
(preloaded)
philosophical
knowledge
on
these
issues
,
no
philosophical
discussions
while
learning
,
and
no
informational
models
of
other
creatures
in
its
memory
(such
models
may
implicitly
or
explicitly
contain
knowledge
about
these
creatures
'

consciousness)
.


However
,
this
test
can
be
used
only
to
detect
,
but
not
refute
the
existence
of
consciousness
.


A
positive
result
proves
that
a
machine
is
conscious
but
a
negative
result
proves
nothing
.


For
example
,
absence
of
philosophical
judgments
may
be
caused
by
lack
of
the
machine
'
s
intellect
,
not
by
absence
of
consciousness
.



Stream
of
consciousness

[edit]

Main
article
:
Stream
of
consciousness
(psychology)

William
James
is
usually
credited
with
popularizing
the
idea
that
human
consciousness
flows
like
a
stream
,
in
his
Principles
of
Psychology
of
1890
.



According
to
James
,
the
"stream
of
thought"
is
governed
by
five
characteristics
:^([200])

1
.


Every
thought
tends
to
be
part
of
a
personal
consciousness
.


2
.


Within
each
personal
consciousness
thought
is
always
changing
.


3
.


Within
each
personal
consciousness
thought
is
sensibly
continuous
.


4
.


It
always
appears
to
deal
with
objects
independent
of
itself
.


5
.


It
is
interested
in
some
parts
of
these
objects
to
the
exclusion
of

others
.



A
similar
concept
appears
in
Buddhist
philosophy
,
expressed
by
the
Sanskrit
term
Citta-saṃtāna
,
which
is
usually
translated
as
mindstream
or
"mental
continuum"
.


Buddhist
teachings
describe
that
consciousness
manifests
moment
to
moment
as
sense
impressions
and
mental
phenomena
that
are
continuously
changing
.

^([201])
The
teachings
list
six
triggers
that
can
result
in
the
generation
of
different
mental
events
.

^([201])
These
triggers
are
input
from
the
five
senses
(seeing
,
hearing
,
smelling
,
tasting
or
touch
sensations)
,
or
a
thought
(relating
to
the
past
,
present
or
the
future)
that
happen
to
arise
in
the
mind
.


The
mental
events
generated
as
a
result
of
these
triggers
are
:
feelings
,
perceptions
and
intentions/behaviour
.


The
moment-by-moment
manifestation
of
the
mind-stream
is
said
to
happen
in
every
person
all
the
time
.


It
even
happens
in
a
scientist
who
analyzes
various
phenomena
in
the
world
,
or
analyzes
the
material
body
including
the
organ
brain
.

^([201])
The
manifestation
of
the
mindstream
is
also
described
as
being
influenced
by
physical
laws
,
biological
laws
,
psychological
laws
,
volitional
laws
,
and
universal
laws
.

^([201])
The
purpose
of
the
Buddhist
practice
of
mindfulness
is
to
understand
the
inherent
nature
of
the
consciousness
and
its
characteristics
.

^([202])

Narrative
form

[edit]

In
the
West
,
the
primary
impact
of
the
idea
has
been
on
literature
rather
than
science
:
"stream
of
consciousness
as
a
narrative
mode"
means
writing
in
a
way
that
attempts
to
portray
the
moment-to-moment
thoughts
and
experiences
of
a
character
.


This
technique
perhaps
had
its
beginnings
in
the
monologues
of
Shakespeare
'
s
plays
and
reached
its
fullest
development
in
the
novels
of
James
Joyce
and
Virginia
Woolf
,
although
it
has
also
been
used
by
many
other
noted
writers
.

^([203])

Here
,
for
example
,
is
a
passage
from
Joyce
'
s
Ulysses
about
the
thoughts
of
Molly
Bloom
:


Yes
because
he
never
did
a
thing
like
that
before
as
ask
to
get
his

breakfast
in
bed
with
a
couple
of
eggs
since
the
City
Arms
hotel
when

he
used
to
be
pretending
to
be
laid
up
with
a
sick
voice
doing
his

highness
to
make
himself
interesting
for
that
old
faggot
Mrs
Riordan

that
he
thought
he
had
a
great
leg
of
and
she
never
left
us
a
farthing

all
for
masses
for
herself
and
her
soul
greatest
miser
ever
was

actually
afraid
to
lay
out
4d
for
her
methylated
spirit
telling
me
all

her
ailments
she
had
too
much
old
chat
in
her
about
politics
and

earthquakes
and
the
end
of
the
world
let
us
have
a
bit
of
fun
first

God
help
the
world
if
all
the
women
were
her
sort
down
on
bathingsuits

and
lownecks
of
course
nobody
wanted
her
to
wear
them
I
suppose
she

was
pious
because
no
man
would
look
at
her
twice
I
hope
Ill
never
be

like
her
a
wonder
she
didnt
want
us
to
cover
our
faces
but
she
was
a

well-educated
woman
certainly
and
her
gabby
talk
about
Mr
Riordan
here

and
Mr
Riordan
there
I
suppose
he
was
glad
to
get
shut
of
her

Spiritual
approaches

Higher
consciousness

To
most
philosophers
,
the
word
"consciousness"
connotes
the
relationship
between
the
mind
and
the
world
.

^([citation

To
writers
on
spiritual
or
religious
topics
,
it
frequently
connotes
the
relationship
between
the

and
God
,
or
the
relationship
between
the

and
deeper
truths
that
are
thought
to
be
more
fundamental
than
the
physical
world

,
author
of
the
1901
book
Cosmic
Consciousness
:
A
Study

,
distinguished
between
three
types

consciousness
:

'
Simple

,
possessed
by
many
animals
;

'

book
The
Spectrum
of
Consciousness
,
a

Wilber
described
consciousness
as

more
profound
types

awareness
at
higher
levels

Consciousness

Perhaps
no
aspect
of
mind
is
more
familiar
or
more
puzzling
than
consciousness
and
our
conscious
experience
of
self
and
world
.


The
problem
of
consciousness
is
arguably
the
central
issue
in
current
theorizing
about
the
mind
.


Despite
the
lack
of
any
agreed
upon
theory
of
consciousness
,
there
is
a
widespread
,
if
less
than
universal
,
consensus
that
an
adequate
account
of
mind
requires
a
clear
understanding
of
it
and
its
place
in
nature
.


We
need
to
understand
both
what
consciousness
is
and
how
it
relates
to
other
,
nonconscious
,
aspects
of
reality
.

History
of
the
issue

Questions
about
the
nature
of
conscious
awareness
have
likely
been
asked
for
as
long
as
there
have
been
humans
.


Neolithic
burial
practices
appear
to
express
spiritual
beliefs
and
provide
early
evidence
for
at
least
minimally
reflective
thought
about
the
nature
of
human
consciousness
(Pearson
1999
,
Clark
and
Riel-Salvatore
2001)
.


Preliterate
cultures
have
similarly
been
found
invariably
to
embrace
some
form
of
spiritual
or
at
least
animist
view
that
indicates
a
degree
of
reflection
about
the
nature
of
conscious
awareness
.



Nonetheless
,
some
have
argued
that
consciousness
as
we
know
it
today
is
a
relatively
recent
historical
development
that
arose
sometime
after
the
Homeric
era
(Jaynes
1974)
.


According
to
this
view
,
earlier
humans
including
those
who
fought
the
Trojan
War
did
not
experience
themselves
as
unified
internal
subjects
of
their
thoughts
and
actions
,
at
least
not
in
the
ways
we
do
today
.


Others
have
claimed
that
even
during
the
classical
period
,
there
was
no
word
of
ancient
Greek
that
corresponds
to
“consciousness”
(Wilkes
1984
,
1988
,
1995)
.


Though
the
ancients
had
much
to
say
about
mental
matters
,
it
is
less
clear
whether
they
had
any
specific
concepts
or
concerns
for
what
we
now
think
of
as
consciousness
.



Although
the
words
“conscious”
and
“conscience”
are
used
quite
differently
today
,
it
is
likely
that
the
Reformation
emphasis
on
the
latter
as
an
inner
source
of
truth
played
some
role
in
the
inward
turn
so
characteristic
of
the
modern
reflective
view
of
self
.


The
Hamlet
who
walked
the
stage
in
1600
already
saw
his
world
and
self
with
profoundly
modern
eyes
.



By
the
beginning
of
the
early
modern
era
in
the
seventeenth
century
,
consciousness
had
come
full
center
in
thinking
about
the
mind
.


Indeed
from
the
mid-17th
through
the
late
19th
century
,
consciousness
was
widely
regarded
as
essential
or
definitive
of
the
mental
.


René
Descartes
defined
the
very
notion
of
thought
(pensée)
in
terms
of
reflexive
consciousness
or
self-awareness
.


In
the
Principles
of
Philosophy
(1640)
he
wrote
,


By
the
word
‘thought’
(‘pensée’)
I
understand
all
that
of
which
we
are

conscious
as
operating
in
us
.



Later
,
toward
the
end
of
the
17th
century
,
John
Locke
offered
a
similar
if
slightly
more
qualified
claim
in
An
Essay
on
Human
Understanding
(1688)
,


I
do
not
say
there
is
no
soul
in
man
because
he
is
not
sensible
of
it

in
his
sleep
.


But
I
do
say
he
can
not
think
at
any
time
,
waking
or

sleeping
,
without
being
sensible
of
it
.


Our
being
sensible
of
it
is

not
necessary
to
anything
but
our
thoughts
,
and
to
them
it
is
and
to

them
it
always
will
be
necessary
.



Locke
explicitly
forswore
making
any
hypothesis
about
the
substantial
basis
of
consciousness
and
its
relation
to
matter
,
but
he
clearly
regarded
it
as
essential
to
thought
as
well
as
to
personal
identity
.



Locke
'
s
contemporary
G
.

W
.


Leibniz
,
drawing
possible
inspiration
from
his
mathematical
work
on
differentiation
and
integration
,
offered
a
theory
of
mind
in
the
Discourse
on
Metaphysics
(1686)
that
allowed
for
infinitely
many
degrees
of
consciousness
and
perhaps
even
for
some
thoughts
that
were
unconscious
,
the
so
called
“petites
perceptions”
.


Leibniz
was
the
first
to
distinguish
explicitly
between
perception
and
apperception
,
i
.

e
.


,
roughly
between
awareness
and
self-awareness
.


In
the
Monadology
(1720)
he
also
offered
his
famous
analogy
of
the
mill
to
express
his
belief
that
consciousness
could
not
arise
from
mere
matter
.


He
asked
his
reader
to
imagine
someone
walking
through
an
expanded
brain
as
one
would
walk
through
a
mill
and
observing
all
its
mechanical
operations
,
which
for
Leibniz
exhausted
its
physical
nature
.


Nowhere
,
he
asserts
,
would
such
an
observer
see
any
conscious
thoughts
.



Despite
Leibniz
'
s
recognition
of
the
possibility
of
unconscious
thought
,
for
most
of
the
next
two
centuries
the
domains
of
thought
and
consciousness
were
regarded
as
more
or
less
the
same
.


Associationist
psychology
,
whether
pursued
by
Locke
or
later
in
the
eighteenth
century
by
David
Hume
(1739)
or
in
the
nineteenth
by
James
Mill
(1829)
,
aimed
to
discover
the
principles
by
which
conscious
thoughts
or
ideas
interacted
or
affected
each
other
.


James
Mill
'
s
son
,
John
Stuart
Mill
continued
his
father
'
s
work
on
associationist
psychology
,
but
he
allowed
that
combinations
of
ideas
might
produce
resultants
that
went
beyond
their
constituent
mental
parts
,
thus
providing
an
early
model
of
mental
emergence
(1865)
.



The
purely
associationist
approach
was
critiqued
in
the
late
eighteenth
century
by
Immanuel
Kant
(1787)
,
who
argued
that
an
adequate
account
of
experience
and
phenomenal
consciousness
required
a
far
richer
structure
of
mental
and
intentional
organization
.


Phenomenal
consciousness
according
to
Kant
could
not
be
a
mere
succession
of
associated
ideas
,
but
at
a
minimum
had
to
be
the
experience
of
a
conscious
self
situated
in
an
objective
world
structured
with
respect
to
space
,
time
and
causality
.



Within
the
Anglo-American
world
,
associationist
approaches
continued
to
be
influential
in
both
philosophy
and
psychology
well
into
the
twentieth
century
,
while
in
the
German
and
European
sphere
there
was
a
greater
interest
in
the
larger
structure
of
experience
that
led
in
part
to
the
study
of
phenomenology
through
the
work
of
Edmund
Husserl
(1913
,
1929)
,
Martin
Heidegger
(1927)
,
Maurice
Merleau-Ponty
(1945)
and
others
who
expanded
the
study
of
consciousness
into
the
realm
of
the
social
,
the
bodily
and
the
interpersonal
.



At
the
outset
of
modern
scientific
psychology
in
the
mid-nineteenth
century
,
the
mind
was
still
largely
equated
with
consciousness
,
and
introspective
methods
dominated
the
field
as
in
the
work
of
Wilhelm
Wundt
(1897)
,
Hermann
von
Helmholtz
(1897)
,
William
James
(1890)
and
Alfred
Titchener
(1901)
.


However
,
the
relation
of
consciousness
to
brain
remained
very
much
a
mystery
as
expressed
in
T
.


H
.


Huxley
'
s
famous
remark
,


How
it
is
that
anything
so
remarkable
as
a
state
of
consciousness

comes
about
as
a
result
of
irritating
nervous
tissue
,
is
just
as

unaccountable
as
the
appearance
of
the
Djin
,
when
Aladdin
rubbed
his

lamp
(1866)
.



The
early
twentieth
century
saw
the
eclipse
of
consciousness
from
scientific
psychology
,
especially
in
the
United
States
with
the
rise
of
behaviorism
(Watson
1924
,
Skinner
1953)
though
movements
such
as
Gestalt
psychology
kept
it
a
matter
of
ongoing
scientific
concern
in
Europe
(Köhler
1929
,
Köffka
1935)
.


In
the
1960s
,
the
grip
of
behaviorism
weakened
with
the
rise
of
cognitive
psychology
and
its
emphasis
on
information
processing
and
the
modeling
of
internal
mental
processes
(Neisser
1965
,
Gardiner
1985)
.


However
,
despite
the
renewed
emphasis
on
explaining
cognitive
capacities
such
as
memory
,
perception
and
language
comprehension
,
consciousness
remained
a
largely
neglected
topic
for
several
further
decades
.



In
the
1980s
and
90s
there
was
a
major
resurgence
of
scientific
and
philosophical
research
into
the
nature
and
basis
of
consciousness
(Baars
1988
,
Dennett
1991
,
Penrose
1989
,
1994
,
Crick
1994
,
Lycan
1987
,
1996
,
Chalmers
1996)
.


Once
consciousness
was
back
under
discussion
,
there
was
a
rapid
proliferation
of
research
with
a
flood
of
books
and
articles
,
as
well
as
the
introduction
of
specialty
journals
(The
Journal
of
Consciousness
Studies
,
Consciousness
and
Cognition
,
Psyche)
,
professional
societies
(Association
for
the
Scientific
Study
of
Consciousness—ASSC)
and
annual
conferences
devoted
exclusively
to

Concepts
of
Consciousness

The
words
“conscious”
and
“consciousness”
are
umbrella
terms
that
cover
a
wide
variety
of
mental
phenomena
.


Both
are
used
with
a
diversity
of
meanings
,
and
the
adjective
“conscious”
is
heterogeneous
in
its
range
,
being
applied
both
to
whole
organisms—creature
consciousness—and
to
particular
mental
states
and
processes—state
consciousness
(Rosenthal
1986
,
Gennaro
1995
,
Carruthers
2000)

1
Creature
Consciousness

An
animal
,
person
or
other
cognitive
system
may
be
regarded
as
conscious
in
a
number
of
different
senses
.



Sentience
.


It
may
be
conscious
in
the
generic
sense
of
simply
being
a
sentient
creature
,
one
capable
of
sensing
and
responding
to
its
world
(Armstrong
1981)
.


Being
conscious
in
this
sense
may
admit
of
degrees
,
and
just
what
sort
of
sensory
capacities
are
sufficient
may
not
be
sharply
defined
.


Are
fish
conscious
in
the
relevant
respect
?


And
what
of
shrimp
or
bees
?



Wakefulness
.


One
might
further
require
that
the
organism
actually
be
exercising
such
a
capacity
rather
than
merely
having
the
ability
or
disposition
to
do
so
.


Thus
one
might
count
it
as
conscious
only
if
it
were
awake
and
normally
alert
.


In
that
sense
organisms
would
not
count
as
conscious
when
asleep
or
in
any
of
the
deeper
levels
of
coma
.


Again
boundaries
may
be
blurry
,
and
intermediate
cases
may
be
involved
.


For
example
,
is
one
conscious
in
the
relevant
sense
when
dreaming
,
hypnotized
or
in
a
fugue
state
?



Self-consciousness
.


A
third
and
yet
more
demanding
sense
might
define
conscious
creatures
as
those
that
are
not
only
aware
but
also
aware
that
they
are
aware
,
thus
treating
creature
consciousness
as
a
form
of
self-consciousness
(Carruthers
2000)
.


The
self-awareness
requirement
might
get
interpreted
in
a
variety
of
ways
,
and
which
creatures
would
qualify
as
conscious
in
the
relevant
sense
will
vary
accordingly
.


If
it
is
taken
to
involve
explicit
conceptual
self-awareness
,
many
non-human
animals
and
even
young
children
might
fail
to
qualify
,
but
if
only
more
rudimentary
implicit
forms
of
self-awareness
are
required
then
a
wide
range
of
nonlinguistic
creatures
might
count
as
self-conscious
.



What
it
is
like
.


Thomas
Nagel
'
s
(1974)
famous“what
it
is
like”
criterion
aims
to
capture
another
and
perhaps
more
subjective
notion
of
being
a
conscious
organism
.


According
to
Nagel
,
a
being
is
conscious
just
if
there
is
“something
that
it
is
like”
to
be
that
creature
,
i
.

e
.


,
some
subjective
way
the
world
seems
or
appears
from
the
creature
'
s
mental
or
experiential
point
of
view
.


In
Nagel
'
s
example
,
bats
are
conscious
because
there
is
something
that
it
is
like
for
a
bat
to
experience
its
world
through
its
echo-locatory
senses
,
even
though
we
humans
from
our
human
point
of
view
can
not
emphatically
understand
what
such
a
mode
of
consciousness
is
like
from
the
bat
'
s
own
point
of
view
.



Subject
of
conscious
states
.


A
fifth
alternative
would
be
to
define
the
notion
of
a
conscious
organism
in
terms
of
conscious
states
.


That
is
,
one
might
first
define
what
makes
a
mental
state
a
conscious
mental
state
,
and
then
define
being
a
conscious
creature
in
terms
of
having
such
states
.


One
'
s
concept
of
a
conscious
organism
would
then
depend
upon
the
particular
account
one
gives
of
conscious
states
(section
2
.

.



Transitive
Consciousness
.


In
addition
to
describing
creatures
as
conscious
in
these
various
senses
,
there
are
also
related
senses
in
which
creatures
are
described
as
being
conscious
of
various
things
.


The
distinction
is
sometimes
marked
as
that
between
transitive
and
intransitive
notions
of
consciousness
,
with
the
former
involving
some
object
at
which
consciousness
is
directed
(Rosenthal
1986)
.

State
consciousness

The
notion
of
a
conscious
mental
state
also
has
a
variety
of
distinct
though
perhaps
interrelated
meanings
.


There
are
at
least
six
major
options
.



States
one
is
aware
of
.


On
one
common
reading
,
a
conscious
mental
state
is
simply
a
mental
state
one
is
aware
of
being
in
(Rosenthal
1986
,
1996)
.


Conscious
states
in
this
sense
involve
a
form
of
meta-mentality
or
meta-intentionality
in
so
far
as
they
require
mental
states
that
are
themselves
about
mental
states
.


To
have
a
conscious
desire
for
a
cup
of
coffee
is
to
have
such
a
desire
and
also
to
be
simultaneously
and
directly
aware
that
one
has
such
a
desire
.


Unconscious
thoughts
and
desires
in
this
sense
are
simply
those
we
have
without
being
aware
of
having
them
,
whether
our
lack
of
self-knowledge
results
from
simple
inattention
or
more
deeply
psychoanalytic
causes
.



Qualitative
states
.


States
might
also
be
regarded
as
conscious
in
a
seemingly
quite
different
and
more
qualitative
sense
.


That
is
,
one
might
count
a
state
as
conscious
just
if
it
has
or
involves
qualitative
or
experiential
properties
of
the
sort
often
referred
to
as
“qualia”
or
“raw
sensory
feels”
.


(See
the
entry
on
qualia
.

)
One
'
s
perception
of
the
Merlot
one
is
drinking
or
of
the
fabric
one
is
examining
counts
as
a
conscious
mental
state
in
this
sense
because
it
involves
various
sensory
qualia
,
e
.

g
.


,
taste
qualia
in
the
wine
case
and
color
qualia
in
one
'
s
visual
experience
of
the
cloth
.


There
is
considerable
disagreement
about
the
nature
of
such
qualia
(Churchland
1985
,
Shoemaker
1990
,
Clark
1993
,
Chalmers
1996)
and
even
about
their
existence
.


Traditionally
qualia
have
been
regarded
as
intrinsic
,
private
,
ineffable
monadic
features
of
experience
,
but
current
theories
of
qualia
often
reject
at
least
some
of
those
commitments
(Dennett
1990)
.



Phenomenal
states
.


Such
qualia
are
sometimes
referred
to
as
phenomenal
properties
and
the
associated
sort
of
consciousness
as
phenomenal
consciousness
,
but
the
latter
term
is
perhaps
more
properly
applied
to
the
overall
structure
of
experience
and
involves
far
more
than
sensory
qualia
.


The
phenomenal
structure
of
consciousness
also
encompasses
much
of
the
spatial
,
temporal
and
conceptual
organization
of
our
experience
of
the
world
and
of
ourselves
as
agents
in
it
(see
section
4
.

3)
.


It
is
therefore
probably
best
,
at
least
initially
,
to
distinguish
the
concept
of
phenomenal
consciousness
from
that
of
qualitative
consciousness
,
though
they
no
doubt
overlap
.



What-it-is-like
states
.


Consciousness
in
both
those
senses
links
up
as
well
with
Thomas
Nagel
'
s
(1974)
notion
of
a
conscious
creature
,
insofar
as
one
might
count
a
mental
state
as
conscious
in
the
“what
it
is
like”
sense
just
if
there
is
something
that
it
is
like
to
be
in
that
state
.


Nagel
'
s
criterion
might
be
understood
as
aiming
to
provide
a
first-person
or
internal
conception
of
what
makes
a
state
a
phenomenal
or
qualitative
state
.



Access
consciousness
.


States
might
be
conscious
in
a
seemingly
quite
different
access
sense
,
which
has
more
to
do
with
intra-mental
relations
.


In
this
respect
,
a
state
'
s
being
conscious
is
a
matter
of
its
availability
to
interact
with
other
states
and
of
the
access
that
one
has
to
its
content
.


In
this
more
functional
sense
,
which
corresponds
to
what
Ned
Block
(1995)
calls
access
consciousness
,
a
visual
state
'
s
being
conscious
is
not
so
much
a
matter
of
whether
or
not
it
has
a
qualitative
“what
it
'
s
likeness”
,
but
of
whether
or
not
it
and
the
visual
information
that
it
carries
is
generally
available
for
use
and
guidance
by
the
organism
.


In
so
far
as
the
information
in
that
state
is
richly
and
flexibly
available
to
its
containing
organism
,
then
it
counts
as
a
conscious
state
in
the
relevant
respect
,
whether
or
not
it
has
any
qualitative
or
phenomenal
feel
in
the
Nagel
sense
.



Narrative
consciousness
.


States
might
also
be
regarded
as
conscious
in
a
narrative
sense
that
appeals
to
the
notion
of
the
“stream
of
consciousness”
,
regarded
as
an
ongoing
more
or
less
serial
narrative
of
episodes
from
the
perspective
of
an
actual
or
merely
virtual
self
.


The
idea
would
be
to
equate
the
person
'
s
conscious
mental
states
with
those
that
appear
in
the
stream
(Dennett
1991
,
1992)
.



Although
these
six
notions
of
what
makes
a
state
conscious
can
be
independently
specified
,
they
are
obviously
not
without
potential
links
,
nor
do
they
exhaust
the
realm
of
possible
options
.


Drawing
connections
,
one
might
argue
that
states
appear
in
the
stream
of
consciousness
only
in
so
far
as
we
are
aware
of
them
,
and
thus
forge
a
bond
between
the
first
meta-mental
notion
of
a
conscious
state
and
the
stream
or
narrative
concept
.


Or
one
might
connect
the
access
with
the
qualitative
or
phenomenal
notions
of
a
conscious
state
by
trying
to
show
that
states
that
represent
in
those
ways
make
their
contents
widely
available
in
the
respect
required
by
the
access
notion
.



Aiming
to
go
beyond
the
six
options
,
one
might
distinguish
conscious
from
nonconscious
states
by
appeal
to
aspects
of
their
intra-mental
dynamics
and
interactions
other
than
mere
access
relations
;
e
.

g
.


,
conscious
states
might
manifest
a
richer
stock
of
content-sensitive
interactions
or
a
greater
degree
of
flexible
purposive
guidance
of
the
sort
associated
with
the
self-conscious
control
of
thought
.


Alternatively
,
one
might
try
to
define
conscious
states
in
terms
of
conscious
creatures
.


That
is
,
one
might
give
some
account
of
what
it
is
to
be
a
conscious
creature
or
perhaps
even
a
conscious
self
,
and
then
define
one
'
s
notion
of
a
conscious
state
in
terms
of
being
a
state
of
such
a
creature
or
system
,
which
would
be
the
converse
of
the
last
option
considered
above
for
defining
conscious
creatures
in
terms
of
conscious
mental
states
.

Consciousness
as
an
entity

The
noun
“consciousness”
has
an
equally
diverse
range
of
meanings
that
largely
parallel
those
of
the
adjective
“conscious”
.


Distinctions
can
be
drawn
between
creature
and
state
consciousness
as
well
as
among
the
varieties
of
each
.


One
can
refer
specifically
to
phenomenal
consciousness
,
access
consciousness
,
reflexive
or
meta-mental
consciousness
,
and
narrative
consciousness
among
other
varieties
.



Here
consciousness
itself
is
not
typically
treated
as
a
substantive
entity
but
merely
the
abstract
reification
of
whatever
property
or
aspect
is
attributed
by
the
relevant
use
of
the
adjective
“conscious”
.


Access
consciousness
is
just
the
property
of
having
the
required
sort
of
internal
access
relations
,
and
qualitative
consciousness
is
simply
the
property
that
is
attributed
when
“conscious”
is
applied
in
the
qualitative
sense
to
mental
states
.


How
much
this
commits
one
to
the
ontological
status
of
consciousness
per
se
will
depend
on
how
much
of
a
Platonist
one
is
about
universals
in
general
.


(See
the
entry
on
the
medieval
problem
of
universals
.

)
It
need
not
commit
one
to
consciousness
as
a
distinct
entity
any
more
than
one
'
s
use
of
“square”
,
“red”
or
“gentle”
commits
one
to
the
existence
of
squareness
,
redness
or
gentleness
as
distinct
entities
.



Though
it
is
not
the
norm
,
one
could
nonetheless
take
a
more
robustly
realist
view
of
consciousness
as
a
component
of
reality
.


That
is
one
could
think
of
consciousness
as
more
on
a
par
with
electromagnetic
fields
than
with
life
.



Since
the
demise
of
vitalism
,
we
do
not
think
of
life
per
se
as
something
distinct
from
living
things
.


There
are
living
things
including
organisms
,
states
,
properties
and
parts
of
organisms
,
communities
and
evolutionary
lineages
of
organisms
,
but
life
is
not
itself
a
further
thing
,
an
additional
component
of
reality
,
some
vital
force
that
gets
added
into
living
things
.


We
apply
the
adjectives
“living”
and
“alive”
correctly
to
many
things
,
and
in
doing
so
we
might
be
said
to
be
attributing
life
to
them
but
with
no
meaning
or
reality
other
than
that
involved
in
their
being
living
things
.



Electromagnetic
fields
by
contrast
are
regarded
as
real
and
independent
parts
of
our
physical
world
.


Even
though
one
may
sometimes
be
able
to
specify
the
values
of
such
a
field
by
appeal
to
the
behavior
of
particles
in
it
,
the
fields
themselves
are
regarded
as
concrete
constituents
of
reality
and
not
merely
as
abstractions
or
sets
of
relations
among
particles
.



Similarly
one
could
regard
“consciousness”
as
referring
to
a
component
or
aspect
of
reality
that
manifests
itself
in
conscious
states
and
creatures
but
is
more
than
merely
the
abstract
nominalization
of
the
adjective
“conscious”
we
apply
to
them
.


Though
such
strongly
realist
views
are
not
very
common
at
present
,
they
should
be
included
within
the
logical
space
of
options
.



There
are
thus
many
concepts
of
consciousness
,
and
both
“conscious”
and
“consciousness”
are
used
in
a
wide
range
of
ways
with
no
privileged
or
canonical
meaning
.


However
,
this
may
be
less
of
an
embarrassment
than
an
embarrassment
of
riches
.


Consciousness
is
a
complex
feature
of
the
world
,
and
understanding
it
will
require
a
diversity
of
conceptual
tools
for
dealing
with
its
many
differing
aspects
.


Conceptual
plurality
is
thus
just
what
one
would
hope
for
.


As
long
as
one
avoids
confusion
by
being
clear
about
one
'
s
meanings
,
there
is
great
value
in
having
a
variety
of
concepts
by
which
we
can
access
and
grasp
consciousness
in
all
its
rich
complexity
.


However
,
one
should
not
assume
that
conceptual
plurality
implies
referential
divergence
.


Our
multiple
concepts
of
consciousness
may
in
fact
pick
out
varying
aspects
of
a
single
unified
underlying
mental
phenomenon
.


Whether
and
to
what
extent
they
do
so
remains
an
open
question
.

Problems
of
Consciousness

The
task
of
understanding
consciousness
is
an
equally
diverse
project
.


Not
only
do
many
different
aspects
of
mind
count
as
conscious
in
some
sense
,
each
is
also
open
to
various
respects
in
which
it
might
be
explained
or
modeled
.


Understanding
consciousness
involves
a
multiplicity
not
only
of
explananda
but
also
of
questions
that
they
pose
and
the
sorts
of
answers
they
require
.


At
the
risk
of
oversimplifying
,
the
relevant
questions
can
be
gathered
under
three
crude
rubrics
as
the
What
,
How
,
and
Why
questions
:

-
The
Descriptive
Question
:
What
is
consciousness
?


What
are
its

principal
features
?


And
by
what
means
can
they
be
best
discovered
,

described
and
modeled
?


-
The
Explanatory
Question
:
How
does
consciousness
of
the
relevant

sort
come
to
exist
?


Is
it
a
primitive
aspect
of
reality
,
and
if
not

how
does
(or
could)
consciousness
in
the
relevant
respect
arise
from

or
be
caused
by
nonconscious
entities
or
processes
?


-
The
Functional
Question
:
Why
does
consciousness
of
the
relevant
sort

exist
?


Does
it
have
a
function
,
and
if
so
what
is
it
?


Does
it
act

causally
and
if
so
with
what
sorts
of
effects
?


Does
it
make
a

difference
to
the
operation
of
systems
in
which
it
is
present
,
and

if
so
why
and
how
?



The
three
questions
focus
respectively
on
describing
the
features
of
consciousness
,
explaining
its
underlying
basis
or
cause
,
and
explicating
its
role
or
value
.


The
divisions
among
the
three
are
of
course
somewhat
artificial
,
and
in
practice
the
answers
one
gives
to
each
will
depend
in
part
on
what
one
says
about
the
others
.


One
can
not
,
for
example
,
adequately
answer
the
what
question
and
describe
the
main
features
of
consciousness
without
addressing
the
why
issue
of
its
functional
role
within
systems
whose
operations
it
affects
.


Nor
could
one
explain
how
the
relevant
sort
of
consciousness
might
arise
from
nonconscious
processes
unless
one
had
a
clear
account
of
just
what
features
had
to
be
caused
or
realized
to
count
as
producing
it
.


Those
caveats
notwithstanding
,
the
three-way
division
of
questions
provides
a
useful
structure
for
articulating
the
overall
explanatory
project
and
for
assessing
the
adequacy
of
particular
theories
or
models
of
consciousness
.

The
descriptive
question
:
What
are
the
features
of
consciousness
?



The
What
question
asks
us
to
describe
and
model
the
principal
features
of
consciousness
,
but
just
which
features
are
relevant
will
vary
with
the
sort
of
consciousness
we
aim
to
capture
.


The
main
properties
of
access
consciousness
may
be
quite
unlike
those
of
qualitative
or
phenomenal
consciousness
,
and
those
of
reflexive
consciousness
or
narrative
consciousness
may
differ
from
both
.


However
,
by
building
up
detailed
theories
of
each
type
,
we
may
hope
to
find
important
links
between
them
and
perhaps
even
to
discover
that
they
coincide
in
at
least
some
key
respects
.

1
First-person
and
third-person
data

The
general
descriptive
project
will
require
a
variety
of
investigational
methods
(Flanagan
1992)
.


Though
one
might
naively
regard
the
facts
of
consciousness
as
too
self-evident
to
require
any
systematic
methods
of
gathering
data
,
the
epistemic
task
is
in
reality
far
from
trivial
(Husserl
1913)
.



First-person
introspective
access
provides
a
rich
and
essential
source
of
insight
into
our
conscious
mental
life
,
but
it
is
neither
sufficient
in
itself
nor
even
especially
helpful
unless
used
in
a
trained
and
disciplined
way
.


Gathering
the
needed
evidence
about
the
structure
of
experience
requires
us
both
to
become
phenomenologically
sophisticated
self-observers
and
to
complement
our
introspective
results
with
many
types
of
third-person
data
available
to
external
observers
(Searle
1992
,
Varela
1995
,
Siewert
1998)

As
phenomenologists
have
known
for
more
than
a
century
,
discovering
the
structure
of
conscious
experience
demands
a
rigorous
inner-directed
stance
that
is
quite
unlike
our
everyday
form
of
self-awareness
(Husserl
1929
,
Merleau-Ponty
1945)
.


Skilled
observation
of
the
needed
sort
requires
training
,
effort
and
the
ability
to
adopt
alternative
perspectives
on
one
'
s
experience
.



The
need
for
third-person
empirical
data
gathered
by
external
observers
is
perhaps
most
obvious
with
regard
to
the
more
clearly
functional
types
of
consciousness
such
as
access
consciousness
,
but
it
is
required
even
with
regard
to
phenomenal
and
qualitative
consciousness
.


For
example
,
deficit
studies
that
correlate
various
neural
and
functional
sites
of
damage
with
abnormalities
of
conscious
experience
can
make
us
aware
of
aspects
of
phenomenal
structure
that
escape
our
normal
introspective
awareness
.


As
such
case
studies
show
,
things
can
come
apart
in
experience
that
seem
inseparably
unified
or
singular
from
our
normal
first-person
point
of
view
(Sacks
1985
,
Shallice
1988
,
Farah
1995)
.



Or
to
pick
another
example
,
third-person
data
can
make
us
aware
of
how
our
experiences
of
acting
and
our
experiences
of
event-timing
affect
each
other
in
ways
that
we
could
never
discern
through
mere
introspection
(Libet
1985
,
Wegner
2002)
.


Nor
are
the
facts
gathered
by
these
third
person
methods
merely
about
the
causes
or
bases
of
consciousness
;
they
often
concern
the
very
structure
of
phenomenal
consciousness
itself
.


First-person
,
third-person
and
perhaps
even
second-person
(Varela
1995)
interactive
methods
will
all
be
needed
to
collect
the
requisite
evidence
.



Using
all
these
sources
of
data
,
we
will
hopefully
be
able
to
construct
detailed
descriptive
models
of
the
various
sorts
of
consciousness
.


Though
the
specific
features
of
most
importance
may
vary
among
the
different
types
,
our
overall
descriptive
project
will
need
to
address
at
least
the
following
seven
general
aspects
of
consciousness
(sections
4
.

2–4
.

.



4

2
Qualitative
character

Qualitative
character
is
often
equated
with
so
called
“raw
feels”
and
illustrated
by
the
redness
one
experiences
when
one
looks
at
ripe
tomatoes
or
the
specific
sweet
savor
one
encounters
when
one
tastes
an
equally
ripe
pineapple
(Locke
1688)
.


The
relevant
sort
of
qualitative
character
is
not
restricted
to
sensory
states
,
but
is
typically
taken
to
be
present
as
an
aspect
of
experiential
states
in
general
,
such
as
experienced
thoughts
or
desires
(Siewert
1998)
.



The
existence
of
such
feels
may
seem
to
some
to
mark
the
threshold
for
states
or
creatures
that
are
really
conscious
.


If
an
organism
senses
and
responds
in
apt
ways
to
its
world
but
lacks
such
qualia
,
then
it
might
count
as
conscious
at
best
in
a
loose
and
less
than
literal
sense
.


Or
so
at
least
it
would
seem
to
those
who
take
qualitative
consciousness
in
the
“what
it
is
like”
sense
to
be
philosophically
and
scientifically
central
(Nagel
1974
,
Chalmers
1996)
.



Qualia
problems
in
many
forms—Can
there
be
inverted
qualia
?


(Block
1980a
1980b
,
Shoemaker
1981
,
1982)
Are
qualia
epiphenomenal
?


(Jackson
1982
,
Chalmers
1996)
How
could
neural
states
give
rise
to
qualia
?


(Levine
1983
,
McGinn
1991)—have
loomed
large
in
the
recent
past
.


But
the
What
question
raises
a
more
basic
problem
of
qualia
:
namely
that
of
giving
a
clear
and
articulated
description
of
our
qualia
space
and
the
status
of
specific
qualia
within
it
.



Absent
such
a
model
,
factual
or
descriptive
errors
are
all
too
likely
.


For
example
,
claims
about
the
unintelligibility
of
the
link
between
experienced
red
and
any
possible
neural
substrate
of
such
an
experience
sometimes
treat
the
relevant
color
quale
as
a
simple
and
sui
generis
property
(Levine
1983)
,
but
phenomenal
redness
in
fact
exists
within
a
complex
color
space
with
multiple
systematic
dimensions
and
similarity
relations
(Hardin
1992)
.


Understanding
the
specific
color
quale
relative
to
that
larger
relational
structure
not
only
gives
us
a
better
descriptive
grasp
of
its
qualitative
nature
,
it
may
also
provide
some
“hooks”
to
which
one
might
attach
intelligible
psycho-physical
links
.



Color
may
be
the
exception
in
terms
of
our
having
a
specific
and
well
developed
formal
understanding
of
the
relevant
qualitative
space
,
but
it
is
not
likely
an
exception
with
regard
to
the
importance
of
such
spaces
to
our
understanding
of
qualitative
properties
in
general
(Clark
1993
,

Phenomenal
structure

Phenomenal
structure
should
not
be
conflated
with
qualitative
structure
,
despite
the
sometimes
interchangeable
use
of
“qualia”
and
“phenomenal
properties”
in
the
literature
.


“Phenomenal
organization”
covers
all
the
various
kinds
of
order
and
structure
found
within
the
domain
of
experience
,
i
.

e
.


,
within
the
domain
of
the
world
as
it
appears
to
us
.


There
are
obviously
important
links
between
the
phenomenal
and
the
qualitative
.


Indeed
qualia
might
be
best
understood
as
properties
of
phenomenal
or
experienced
objects
,
but
there
is
in
fact
far
more
to
the
phenomenal
than
raw
feels
.


As
Kant
(1787)
,
Husserl
(1913)
,
and
generations
of
phenomenologists
have
shown
,
the
phenomenal
structure
of
experience
is
richly
intentional
and
involves
not
only
sensory
ideas
and
qualities
but
complex
representations
of
time
,
space
,
cause
,
body
,
self
,
world
and
the
organized
structure
of
lived
reality
in
all
its
conceptual
and
nonconceptual
forms
.



Since
many
non-conscious
states
also
have
intentional
and
representational
aspects
,
it
may
be
best
to
consider
phenomenal
structure
as
involving
a
special
kind
of
intentional
and
representational
organization
and
content
,
the
kind
distinctively
associated
with
consciousness
(Siewert
1998)
.


(See
the
entry
on
representational
theories
of
consciousness
.

)

Answering
the
What
question
requires
a
careful
account
of
the
coherent
and
densely
organized
representational
framework
within
which
particular
experiences
are
embedded
.


Since
most
of
that
structure
is
only
implicit
in
the
organization
of
experience
,
it
can
not
just
be
read
off
by
introspection
.


Articulating
the
structure
of
the
phenomenal
domain
in
a
clear
and
intelligible
way
is
a
long
and
difficult
process
of
inference
and
model
building
(Husserl
1929)
.


Introspection
can
aid
it
,
but
a
lot
of
theory
construction
and
ingenuity
are
also
needed
.



There
has
been
recent
philosophical
debate
about
the
range
of
properties
that
are
phenomenally
present
or
manifest
in
conscious
experience
,
in
particular
with
respect
to
cognitive
states
such
as
believing
or
thinking
.


Some
have
argued
for
a
so
called
“thin”
view
according
to
which
phenomenal
properties
are
limited
to
qualia
representing
basic
sensory
properties
,
such
as
colors
,
shapes
,
tones
and
feels
.


According
to
such
theorists
,
there
is
no
distinctive
“what-it-is-likeness”
involved
in
believing
that
Paris
is
the
capital
of
France
or
that
17
is
a
prime
number
(Tye
,
Prinz
2012)
.


Some
imagery
,
e
.

g
.


,
of
the
Eiffel
Tower
,
may
accompany
our
having
such
a
thought
,
but
that
is
incidental
to
it
and
the
cognitive
state
itself
has
no
phenomenal
feel
.


On
the
thin
view
,
the
phenomenal
aspect
of
perceptual
states
as
well
is
limited
to
basic
sensory
features
;
when
one
sees
an
image
of
Winston
Churchill
,
one
'
s
perceptual
phenomenology
is
limited
only
to
the
spatial
aspects
of
his
face
.



Others
holds
a
“thick”
view
according
to
which
the
phenomenology
of
perception
includes
a
much
wider
range
of
features
and
cognitive
states
have
a
distinctive
phenomenology
as
well
(Strawson
2003
,
Pitt
2004
,
Seigel
2010)
.


On
the
thick
view
,
the
what-it-is-likeness
of
perceiving
an
image
of
Marilyn
Monroe
includes
one
'
s
recognition
of
her
history
as
part
of
the
felt
aspect
of
the
experience
,
and
beliefs
and
thoughts
as
well
can
and
typically
do
have
a
distinctive
nonsensory
phenomenology
.


Both
sides
of
the
debate
are
well
represented
in
the
volume
Cognitive
Phenomenology
(Bayne
and
Montague
2010)
.

Subjectivity

Subjectivity
is
another
notion
sometimes
equated
with
the
qualitative
or
the
phenomenal
aspects
of
consciousness
in
the
literature
,
but
again
there
are
good
reason
to
recognize
it
,
at
least
in
some
of
its
forms
,
as
a
distinct
feature
of
consciousness—related
to
the
qualitative
and
the
phenomenal
but
different
from
each
.


In
particular
,
the
epistemic
form
of
subjectivity
concerns
apparent
limits
on
the
knowability
or
even
the
understandability
of
various
facts
about
conscious
experience
(Nagel
1974
,
Van
Gulick
1985
,
Lycan
1996)
.



On
Thomas
Nagel
'
s
(1974)
account
,
facts
about
what
it
is
like
to
be
a
bat
are
subjective
in
the
relevant
sense
because
they
can
be
fully
understood
only
from
the
bat-type
point
of
view
.


Only
creatures
capable
of
having
or
undergoing
similar
such
experiences
can
understand
their
what-it
'
s-likeness
in
the
requisite
empathetic
sense
.


Facts
about
conscious
experience
can
be
at
best
incompletely
understood
from
an
outside
third
person
point
of
view
,
such
as
those
associated
with
objective
physical
science
.


A
similar
view
about
the
limits
of
third-person
theory
seems
to
lie
behind
claims
regarding
what
Frank
Jackson
'
s
(1982)
hypothetical
Mary
,
the
super
color
scientist
,
could
not
understand
about
experiencing
red
because
of
her
own
impoverished
history
of
achromatic
visual
experience
.



Whether
facts
about
experience
are
indeed
epistemically
limited
in
this
way
is
open
to
debate
(Lycan
1996)
,
but
the
claim
that
understanding
consciousness
requires
special
forms
of
knowing
and
access
from
the
inside
point
of
view
is
intuitively
plausible
and
has
a
long
history
(Locke
1688)
.


Thus
any
adequate
answer
to
the
What
question
must
address
the
epistemic
status
of
consciousness
,
both
our
abilities
to
understand
it
and
their
limits
(Papineau
2002
,
Chalmers
2003)
.

the

self-knowledge

5
Self-perspectival
organization

The
perspectival
structure
of
consciousness
is
one
aspect
of
its
overall
phenomenal
organization
,
but
it
is
important
enough
to
merit
discussion
in
its
own
right
.


Insofar
as
the
key
perspective
is
that
of
the
conscious
self
,
the
specific
feature
might
be
called
self-perspectuality
.


Conscious
experiences
do
not
exist
as
isolated
mental
atoms
,
but
as
modes
or
states
of
a
conscious
self
or
subject
(Descartes
1644
,
Searle
1992
,
though
pace
Hume
1739)
.


A
visual
experience
of
a
blue
sphere
is
always
a
matter
of
there
being
some
self
or
subject
who
is
appeared
to
in
that
way
.


A
sharp
and
stabbing
pain
is
always
a
pain
felt
or
experienced
by
some
conscious
subject
.


The
self
need
not
appear
as
an
explicit
element
in
our
experiences
,
but
as
Kant
(1787)
noted
the
“I
think”
must
at
least
potentially
accompany
each
of
them
.



The
self
might
be
taken
as
the
perspectival
point
from
which
the
world
of
objects
is
present
to
experience
(Wittgenstein
1921)
.


It
provides
not
only
a
spatial
and
temporal
perspective
for
our
experience
of
the
world
but
one
of
meaning
and
intelligibility
as
well
.


The
intentional
coherence
of
the
experiential
domain
relies
upon
the
dual
interdependence
between
self
and
world
:
the
self
as
perspective
from
which
objects
are
known
and
the
world
as
the
integrated
structure
of
objects
and
events
whose
possibilities
of
being
experienced
implicitly
define
the
nature
and
location
of
the
self
(Kant
1787
,
Husserl
1929)
.



Conscious
organisms
obviously
differ
in
the
extent
to
which
they
constitute
a
unified
and
coherent
self
,
and
they
likely
differ
accordingly
in
the
sort
or
degree
of
perspectival
focus
they
embody
in
their
respective
forms
of
experience
(Lorenz
1977)
.


Consciousness
may
not
require
a
distinct
or
substantial
self
of
the
traditional
Cartesian
sort
,
but
at
least
some
degree
of
perspectivally
self-like
organization
seems
essential
for
the
existence
of
anything
that
might
count
as
conscious
experience
.


Experiences
seem
no
more
able
to
exist
without
a
self
or
subject
to
undergo
them
than
could
ocean
waves
exist
without
the
sea
through
which
they
move
.


The
Descriptive
question
thus
requires
some
account
of
the
self-perspectival
aspect
of
experience
and
the
self-like
organization
of
conscious
minds
on
which
it
depends
,
even
if
the
relevant
account
treats
the
self
in
a
relatively
deflationary
and
virtual
way
(Dennett
1991
,
1992)
.

Unity

Unity
is
closely
linked
with
the
self-perspective
,
but
it
merits
specific
mention
on
its
own
as
a
key
aspect
of
the
organization
of
consciousness
.


Conscious
systems
and
conscious
mental
states
both
involve
many
diverse
forms
of
unity
.


Some
are
causal
unities
associated
with
the
integration
of
action
and
control
into
a
unified
focus
of
agency
.


Others
are
more
representational
and
intentional
forms
of
unity
involving
the
integration
of
diverse
items
of
content
at
many
scales
and
levels
of
binding
(Cleeremans
2003)
.



Some
such
integrations
are
relatively
local
as
when
diverse
features
detected
within
a
single
sense
modality
are
combined
into
a
representation
of
external
objects
bearing
those
features
,

when
one
has
a
conscious
visual
experience
of
a
moving
red
soup
can
passing
above
a
green
striped
napkin
(Triesman
and
Gelade
1980)
.



Other
forms
of
intentional
unity
encompass
a
far
wider
range
of
contents
.


The
content
of
one
'
s
present
experience
of
the
room
in
which
one
sits
depends
in
part
upon
its
location
within
a
far
larger
structure
associated
with
one
'
s
awareness
of
one
'
s
existence
as
an
ongoing
temporally
extended
observer
within
a
world
of
spatially
connected
independently
existing
objects
(Kant
1787
,
Husserl
1913)
.


The
individual
experience
can
have
the
content
that
it
does
only
because
it
resides
within
that
larger
unified
structure
of
representation
.


(See
the
entry
on
unity
of
consciousness

)

Particular
attention
has
been
paid
recently
to
the
notion
of
phenomenal
unity
(Bayne
2010)
and
its
relation
to
other
forms
of
conscious
unity
such
as
those
involving
representational
,
functional
or
neural
integration
.


Some
have
argued
that
phenomenal
unity
can
be
reduced
to
representational
unity
(Tye
2005)
while
others
have
denied
the
possibility
of
any
such
reduction
(Bayne
2010)
.

Intentionality
and
transparency

Conscious
mental
states
are
typically
regarded
as
having
a
representational
or
intentional
aspect
in
so
far
as
they
are
about
things
,
refer
to
things
or
have
satisfaction
conditions
.


One
'
s
conscious
visual
experience
correctly
represents
the
world
if
there
are
lilacs
in
a
white
vase
on
the
table
(pace
Travis
2004)
,
one
'
s
conscious
memory
is
of
the
attack
on
the
World
Trade
Center
,
and
one
'
s
conscious
desire
is
for
a
glass
of
cold
water
.


However
,
nonconscious
states
can
also
exhibit
intentionality
in
such
ways
,
and
it
is
important
to
understand
the
ways
in
which
the
representational
aspects
of
conscious
states
resemble
and
differ
from
those
of
nonconscious
states
(Carruthers
2000)
.


Searle
(1990)
offers
a
contrary
view
according
to
which
only
conscious
states
and
dispositions
to
have
conscious
states
can
be
genuinely
intentional
,
but
most
theorists
regard
intentionality
as
extending
widely
into
the
unconscious
domain
.


(See
the
entry
on
consciousness
and
intentionality
.

)

One
potentially
important
dimension
of
difference
concerns
so
called
transparency
,
which
is
an
important
feature
of
consciousness
in
two
interrelated
metaphoric
senses
,
each
of
which
has
an
intentional
,
an
experiential
and
a
functional
aspect
.



Conscious
perceptual
experience
is
often
said
to
be
transparent
,
or
in
G
.

E
.


Moore
'
s
(1922)
phrase
“diaphanous”
.


We
transparently
“look
through”
our
sensory
experience
in
so
far
as
we
seem
directly
aware
of
external
objects
and
events
present
to
us
rather
than
being
aware
of
any
properties
of
experience
by
which
it
presents
or
represents
such
objects
to
us
.


When
I
look
out
at
the
wind-blown
meadow
,
it
is
the
undulating
green
grass
of
which
I
am
aware
not
of
any
green
property
of
my
visual
experience
.


(See
the
entry
on
representational
theories
of
consciousness
.

)
Moore
himself
believed
we
could
become
aware
of
those
latter
qualities
with
effort
and
redirection
of
attention
,
though
some
contemporary
transparency
advocates
deny
it
(Harman
1990
,
Tye
1995
,
Kind
2003)
.



Conscious
thoughts
and
experiences
are
also
transparent
in
a
semantic
sense
in
that
their
meanings
seem
immediately
known
to
us
in
the
very
act
of
thinking
them
(Van
Gulick
1992)
.


In
that
sense
we
might
be
said
to
‘think
right
through’
them
to
what
they
mean
or
represent
.


Transparency
in
this
semantic
sense
may
correspond
at
least
partly
with
what
John
Searle
calls
the
“intrinsic
intentionality”
of
consciousness
(Searle
1992)
.



Our
conscious
mental
states
seem
to
have
their
meanings
intrinsically
or
from
the
inside
just
by
being
what
they
are
in
themselves
,
by
contrast
with
many
externalist
theories
of
mental
content
that
ground
meaning
in
causal
,
counterfactual
or
informational
relations
between
bearers
of
intentionality
and
their
semantic
or
referential
objects
.



The
view
of
conscious
content
as
intrinsically
determined
and
internally
self-evident
is
sometimes
supported
by
appeals
to
brain
in
the
vat
intuitions
,
which
make
it
seem
that
the
envatted
brain
'
s
conscious
mental
states
would
keep
all
their
normal
intentional
contents
despite
the
loss
of
all
their
normal
causal
and
informational
links
to
the
world
(Horgan
and
Tienson
2002)
.


There
is
continued
controversy
about
such
cases
and
about
competing
internalist
(Searle
1992)
and
externalist
views
(Dretske
1995)
of
conscious
intentionality
.



Though
semantic
transparency
and
intrinsic
intentionality
have
some
affinities
,
they
should
not
be
simply
equated
,
since
it
may
be
possible
to
accommodate
the
former
notion
within
a
more
externalist
account
of
content
and
meaning
.


Both
semantic
and
sensory
transparency
obviously
concern
the
representational
or
intentional
aspects
of
consciousness
,
but
they
are
also
experiential
aspects
of
our
conscious
life
.


They
are
part
of
what
it
'
s
like
or
how
it
feels
phenomenally
to
be
conscious
.


They
also
both
have
functional
aspects
,
in
so
far
as
conscious
experiences
interact
with
each
other
in
richly
content-appropriate
ways
that
manifest
our
transparent
understanding
of
their
contents
.

Dynamic
flow

The
dynamics
of
consciousness
are
evident
in
the
coherent
order
of
its
ever
changing
process
of
flow
and
self-transformation
,
what
William
James
(1890)
called
the
“stream
of
consciousness
.

”
Some
temporal
sequences
of
experience
are
generated
by
purely
internal
factors
as
when
one
thinks
through
a
puzzle
,
and
others
depend
in
part
upon
external
causes
as
when
one
chases
a
fly
ball
,
but
even
the
latter
sequences
are
shaped
in
large
part
by
how
consciousness
transforms
itself
.



Whether
partly
in
response
to
outer
influences
or
entirely
from
within
,
each
moment
to
moment
sequence
of
experience
grows
coherently
out
of
those
that
preceded
it
,
constrained
and
enabled
by
the
global
structure
of
links
and
limits
embodied
in
its
underlying
prior
organization
(Husserl
1913)
.


In
that
respect
,
consciousness
is
an
autopoietic
system
,
i
.

e
.


,
a
self-creating
and
self-organizing
system
(Varela
and
Maturana
1980)
.



As
a
conscious
mental
agent
I
can
do
many
things
such
as
scan
my
room
,
scan
a
mental
image
of
it
,
review
in
memory
the
courses
of
a
recent
restaurant
meal
along
with
many
of
its
tastes
and
scents
,
reason
my
way
through
a
complex
problem
,
or
plan
a
grocery
shopping
trip
and
execute
that
plan
when
I
arrive
at
the
market
.


These
are
all
routine
and
common
activities
,
but
each
involves
the
directed
generation
of
experiences
in
ways
that
manifest
an
implicit
practical
understanding
of
their
intentional
properties
and
interconnected
contents
(Van
Gulick
2000)
.



Consciousness
is
a
dynamic
process
,
and
thus
an
adequate
descriptive
answer
to
the
What
question
must
deal
with
more
than
just
its
static
or
momentary
properties
.


In
particular
,
it
must
give
some
account
of
the
temporal
dynamics
of
consciousness
and
the
ways
in
which
its
self-transforming
flow
reflects
both
its
intentional
coherence
and
the
semantic
self-understanding
embodied
in
the
organized
controls
through
which
conscious
minds
continually
remake
themselves
as
autopoietic
systems
engaged
with
their
worlds
.



A
comprehensive
descriptive
account
of
consciousness
would
need
to
deal
with
more
than
just
these
seven
features
,
but
having
a
clear
account
of
each
of
them
would
take
us
a
long
way
toward
answering
the
“What
is
consciousness
?

”
question
.



5
.


The
explanatory
question
:
How
can
consciousness
exist
?



The
How
question
focuses
on
explanation
rather
than
description
.


It
asks
us
to
explain
the
basic
status
of
consciousness
and
its
place
in
nature
.


Is
it
a
fundamental
feature
of
reality
in
its
own
right
,
or
does
its
existence
depend
upon
other
nonconscious
items
,
be
they
physical
,
biological
,
neural
or
computational
?


And
if
the
latter
,
can
we
explain
or
understand
how
the
relevant
nonconscious
items
could
cause
or
realize
consciousness
?


Put
simply
,
can
we
explain
how
to
make
something
conscious
out
of
things
that
are
not
conscious
?

1
Diversity
of
explanatory
projects

The
How
question
is
not
a
single
question
,
but
rather
a
general
family
of
more
specific
questions
(Van
Gulick
1995)
.


They
all
concern
the
possibility
of
explaining
some
sort
or
aspect
of
consciousness
,
but
they
vary
in
their
particular
explananda
,
the
restrictions
on
their
explanans
,
and
their
criteria
for
successful
explanation
.


For
example
,
one
might
ask
whether
we
can
explain
access
consciousness
computationally
by
mimicking
the
requisite
access
relations
in
a
computational
model
.


Or
one
might
be
concerned
instead
with
whether
the
phenomenal
and
qualitative
properties
of
a
conscious
creature
'
s
mind
can
be
a
priori
deduced
from
a
description
of
the
neural
properties
of
its
brain
processes
.


Both
are
versions
of
the
How
question
,
but
they
ask
about
the
prospects
of
very
different
explanatory
projects
,
and
thus
may
differ
in
their
answers
(Lycan
1996)
.


It
would
be
impractical
,
if
not
impossible
,
to
catalog
all
the
possible
versions
of
the
How
question
,
but
some
of
the
main
options
can
be
listed
.



Explananda
.


Possible
explananda
would
include
the
various
sorts
of
state
and
creature
consciousness
distinguished
above
,
as
well
as
the
seven
features
of
consciousness
listed
in
response
to
the
What
question
.


Those
two
types
of
explananda
overlap
and
intersect
.


We
might
for
example
aim
to
explain
the
dynamic
aspect
either
of
phenomenal
or
of
access
consciousness
.


Or
we
could
try
to
explain
the
subjectivity
of
either
qualitative
or
meta-mental
consciousness
.


Not
every
feature
applies
to
every
sort
of
consciousness
,
but
all
apply
to
several
.


How
one
explains
a
given
feature
in
relation
to
one
sort
of
consciousness
may
not
correspond
with
what
is
needed
to
explain
it
relative
to
another
.



Explanans
.


The
range
of
possible
explanans
is
also
diverse
.


In
perhaps
its
broadest
form
,
the
How
question
asks
how
consciousness
of
the
relevant
sort
could
be
caused
or
realized
by
nonconscious
items
,
but
we
can
generate
a
wealth
of
more
specific
questions
by
further
restricting
the
range
of
the
relevant
explanans
.


One
might
seek
to
explain
how
a
given
feature
of
consciousness
is
caused
or
realized
by
underlying
neural
processes
,
biological
structures
,
physical
mechanisms
,
functional
or
teleofunctional
relations
,
computational
organization
,
or
even
by
nonconscious
mental
states
.


The
prospects
for
explanatory
success
will
vary
accordingly
.


In
general
the
more
limited
and
elementary
the
range
of
the
explanans
,
the
more
difficult
the
problem
of
explaining
how
could
it
suffice
to
produce
consciousness
(Van
Gulick
1995)
.



Criteria
of
explanation
.


The
third
key
parameter
is
how
one
defines
the
criterion
for
a
successful
explanation
.


One
might
require
that
the
explanandum
be
a
priori
deducible
from
the
explanans
,
although
it
is
controversial
whether
this
is
either
a
necessary
or
a
sufficient
criterion
for
explaining
consciousness
(Jackson
1993)
.


Its
sufficiency
will
depend
in
part
on
the
nature
of
the
premises
from
which
the
deduction
proceeds
.


As
a
matter
of
logic
,
one
will
need
some
bridge
principles
to
connect
propositions
or
sentences
about
consciousness
with
those
that
do
not
mention
it
.


If
one
'
s
premises
concern
physical
or
neural
facts
,
then
one
will
need
some
bridge
principles
or
links
that
connect
such
facts
with
facts
about
consciousness
(Kim
1998)
.


Brute
links
,
whether
nomic
or
merely
well
confirmed
correlations
,
could
provide
a
logically
sufficient
bridge
to
infer
conclusions
about
consciousness
.


But
they
would
probably
not
allow
us
to
see
how
or
why
those
connections
hold
,
and
thus
they
would
fall
short
of
fully
explaining
how
consciousness
exists
(Levine
1983
,
1993
,
McGinn
1991)
.



One
could
legitimately
ask
for
more
,
in
particular
for
some
account
that
made
intelligible
why
those
links
hold
and
perhaps
why
they
could
not
fail
to
do
so
.


A
familiar
two-stage
model
for
explaining
macro-properties
in
terms
of
micro-substrates
is
often
invoked
.


In
the
first
step
,
one
analyzes
the
macro-property
in
terms
of
functional
conditions
,
and
then
in
the
second
stage
one
shows
that
the
micro-structures
obeying
the
laws
of
their
own
level
nomically
suffice
to
guarantee
the
satisfaction
of
the
relevant
functional
conditions
(Armstrong
1968
,
Lewis
1972)
.



The
micro-properties
of
collections
of
H2O
molecules
at
20°C
suffice
to
satisfy
the
conditions
for
the
liquidity
of
the
water
they
compose
.


Moreover
,
the
model
makes
intelligible
how
the
liquidity
is
produced
by
the
micro-properties
.


A
satisfactory
explanation
of
how
consciousness
is
produced
might
seem
to
require
a
similar
two
stage
story
.


Without
it
,
even
a
priori
deducibility
might
seem
explanatorily
less
than
sufficient
,
though
the
need
for
such
a
story
remains
a
matter
of
controversy
(Block
and
Stalnaker
1999
,
Chalmers
and
Jackson
2001)
.

2
The
explanatory
gap

Our
current
inability
to
supply
a
suitably
intelligible
link
is
sometimes
described
,
following
Joseph
Levine
(1983)
,
as
the
existence
of
an
explanatory
gap
,
and
as
indicating
our
incomplete
understanding
of
how
consciousness
might
depend
upon
a
nonconscious
substrate
,
especially
a
physical
substrate
.


The
basic
gap
claim
admits
of
many
variations
in
generality
and
thus
in
strength
.



In
perhaps
its
weakest
form
,
it
asserts
a
practical
limit
on
our
present
explanatory
abilities
;
given
our
current
theories
and
models
we
can
not
now
articulate
an
intelligible
link
.


A
stronger
version
makes
an
in
principle
claim
about
our
human
capacities
and
thus
asserts
that
given
our
human
cognitive
limits
we
will
never
be
able
to
bridge
the
gap
.


To
us
,
or
creatures
cognitively
like
us
,
it
must
remain
a
residual
mystery
(McGinn
1991)
.


Colin
McGinn
(1995)
has
argued
that
given
the
inherently
spatial
nature
of
both
our
human
perceptual
concepts
and
the
scientific
concepts
we
derive
from
them
,
we
humans
are
not
conceptually
suited
for
understanding
the
nature
of
the
psychophysical
link
.


Facts
about
that
link
are
as
cognitively
closed
to
us
as
are
facts
about
multiplication
or
square
roots
to
armadillos
.


They
do
not
fall
within
our
conceptual
and
cognitive
repertoire
.


An
even
stronger
version
of
the
gap
claim
removes
the
restriction
to
our
cognitive
nature
and
denies
in
principle
that
the
gap
can
be
closed
by
any
cognitive
agents
.



Those
who
assert
gap
claims
disagree
among
themselves
about
what
metaphysical
conclusions
,
if
any
,
follow
from
our
supposed
epistemic
limits
.


Levine
himself
has
been
reluctant
to
draw
any
anti-physicalist
ontological
conclusions
(Levine
1993
,
2001)
.


On
the
other
hand
some
neodualists
have
tried
to
use
the
existence
of
the
gap
to
refute
physicalism
(Foster
1996
,
Chalmers
1996)
.


The
stronger
one
'
s
epistemological
premise
,
the
better
the
hope
of
deriving
a
metaphysical
conclusion
.


Thus
unsurprisingly
,
dualist
conclusions
are
often
supported
by
appeals
to
the
supposed
impossibility
in
principle
of
closing
the
gap
.



If
one
could
see
on
a
priori
grounds
that
there
is
no
way
in
which
consciousness
could
be
intelligibly
explained
as
arising
from
the
physical
,
it
would
not
be
a
big
step
to
concluding
that
it
in
fact
does
not
do
so
(Chalmers
1996)
.


However
,
the
very
strength
of
such
an
epistemological
claim
makes
it
difficult
to
assume
with
begging
the
metaphysical
result
in
question
.


Thus
those
who
wish
to
use
a
strong
in
principle
gap
claim
to
refute
physicalism
must
find
independent
grounds
to
support
it
.


Some
have
appealed
to
conceivability
arguments
for
support
,
such
as
the
alleged
conceivability
of
zombies
molecularly
identical
with
conscious
humans
but
devoid
of
all
phenomenal
consciousness
(Campbell
1970
,
Kirk
1974
,
Chalmers
1996)
.


Other
supporting
arguments
invoke
the
supposed
non-functional
nature
of
consciousness
and
thus
its
alleged
resistance
to
the
standard
scientific
method
of
explaining
complex
properties
(e
.

g
.


,
genetic
dominance)
in
terms
of
physically
realized
functional
conditions
(Block
1980a
,
Chalmers
1996)
.


Such
arguments
avoid
begging
the
anti-physicalist
question
,
but
they
themselves
rely
upon
claims
and
intuitions
that
are
controversial
and
not
completely
independent
of
one
'
s
basic
view
about
physicalism
.


Discussion
on
the
topic
remains
active
and
ongoing
.



Our
present
inability
to
see
any
way
of
closing
the
gap
may
exert
some
pull
on
our
intuitions
,
but
it
may
simply
reflect
the
limits
of
our
current
theorizing
rather
than
an
unbridgeable
in
principle
barrier
(Dennett
1991)
.


Moreover
,
some
physicalists
have
argued
that
explanatory
gaps
are
to
be
expected
and
are
even
entailed
by
plausible
versions
of
ontological
physicalism
,
ones
that
treat
human
agents
as
physically
realized
cognitive
systems
with
inherent
limits
that
derive
from
their
evolutionary
origin
and
situated
contextual
mode
of
understanding
(Van
Gulick
1985
,
2003
;
McGinn
1991
,
Papineau
1995
,
2002)
.


On
this
view
,
rather
than
refuting
physicalism
,
the
existence
of
explanatory
gaps
may
confirm
it
.


Discussion
and
disagreement
on
these
topics
remains
active
and
ongoing
.

Reductive
and
non-reductive
explanation

As
the
need
for
intelligible
linkage
has
shown
,
a
priori
deducibility
is
not
in
itself
obviously
sufficient
for
successful
explanation
(Kim
1980)
,
nor
is
it
clearly
necessary
.


Some
weaker
logical
link
might
suffice
in
many
explanatory
contexts
.


We
can
sometimes
tell
enough
of
a
story
about
how
facts
of
one
sort
depend
upon
those
of
another
to
satisfy
ourselves
that
the
latter
do
in
fact
cause
or
realize
the
former
even
if
we
can
not
strictly
deduce
all
the
former
facts
from
the
latter
.



Strict
intertheoretical
deduction
was
taken
as
the
reductive
norm
by
the
logical
empiricist
account
of
the
unity
of
science
(Putnam
and
Oppenheim
1958)
,
but
in
more
recent
decades
a
looser
nonreductive
picture
of
relations
among
the
various
sciences
has
gained
favor
.


In
particular
,
nonreductive
materialists
have
argued
for
the
so
called
“autonomy
of
the
special
sciences”
(Fodor
1974)
and
for
the
view
that
understanding
the
natural
world
requires
us
to
use
a
diversity
of
conceptual
and
representational
systems
that
may
not
be
strictly
intertranslatable
or
capable
of
being
put
into
the
tight
correspondence
required
by
the
older
deductive
paradigm
of
interlevel
relations
(Putnam
1975)
.



Economics
is
often
cited
as
an
example
(Fodor
1974
,
Searle
1992)
.


Economic
facts
may
be
realized
by
underlying
physical
processes
,
but
no
one
seriously
demands
that
we
be
able
to
deduce
the
relevant
economic
facts
from
detailed
descriptions
of
their
underlying
physical
bases
or
that
we
be
able
to
put
the
concepts
and
vocabulary
of
economics
in
tight
correspondence
with
those
of
the
physical
sciences
.



Nonetheless
our
deductive
inability
is
not
seen
as
cause
for
ontological
misgivings
;
there
is
no
“money-matter”
problem
.


All
that
we
require
is
some
general
and
less
than
deductive
understanding
of
how
economic
properties
and
relations
might
be
underlain
by
physical
ones
.


Thus
one
might
opt
for
a
similar
criterion
for
interpreting
the
How
question
and
for
what
counts
as
explaining
how
consciousness
might
be
caused
or
realized
by
nonconscious
items
.


However
,
some
critics
,
such
as
Kim
(1987)
,
have
challenged
the
coherence
of
any
view
that
aims
to
be
both
non-reductive
and
physicalist
,
though
supporters
of
such
views
have
replied
in
turn
(Van
Gulick
1993)
.



Others
have
argued
that
consciousness
is
especially
resistant
to
explanation
in
physical
terms
because
of
the
inherent
differences
between
our
subjective
and
objective
modes
of
understanding
.


Thomas
Nagel
famously
argued
(1974)
that
there
are
unavoidable
limits
placed
on
our
ability
to
understand
the
phenomenology
of
bat
experience
by
our
inability
to
empathetically
take
on
an
experiential
perspective
like
that
which
characterizes
the
bat
'
s
echo-locatory
auditory
experience
of
its
world
.


Given
our
inability
to
undergo
similar
experience
,
we
can
have
at
best
partial
understanding
of
the
nature
of
such
experience
.


No
amount
of
knowledge
gleaned
from
the
external
objective
third-person
perspective
of
the
natural
sciences
will
supposedly
suffice
to
allow
us
to
understand
what
the
bat
can
understand
of
its
own
experience
from
its
internal
first-person
subjective
point
of
view
.

4
Prospects
of
explanatory
success

The
How
question
thus
subdivides
into
a
diverse
family
of
more
specific
questions
depending
upon
the
specific
sort
or
feature
of
consciousness
one
aims
to
explain
,
the
specific
restrictions
one
places
on
the
range
of
the
explanans
and
the
criterion
one
uses
to
define
explanatory
success
.


Some
of
the
resulting
variants
seem
easier
to
answer
than
others
.


Progress
may
seem
likely
on
some
of
the
so
called
“easy
problems”
of
consciousness
,
such
as
explaining
the
dynamics
of
access
consciousness
in
terms
of
the
functional
or
computational
organization
of
the
brain
(Baars
1988)
.


Others
may
seem
less
tractable
,
especially
the
so-called
“hard
problem”
(Chalmers
1995)
which
is
more
or
less
that
of
giving
an
intelligible
account
that
lets
us
see
in
an
intuitively
satisfying
way
how
phenomenal
or
“what
it
'
s
like”
consciousness
might
arise
from
physical
or
neural
processes
in
the
brain
.



Positive
answers
to
some
versions
of
the
How
questions
seem
near
at
hand
,
but
others
appear
to
remain
deeply
baffling
.


Nor
should
we
assume
that
every
version
has
a
positive
answer
.


If
dualism
is
true
,
then
consciousness
in
at
least
some
of
its
types
may
be
basic
and
fundamental
.


If
so
,we
will
not
be
able
to
explain
how
it
arises
from
nonconscious
items
since
it
simply
does
not
do
so
.



One
'
s
view
of
the
prospects
for
explaining
consciousness
will
typically
depend
upon
one
'
s
perspective
.


Optimistic
physicalists
will
likely
see
current
explanatory
lapses
as
merely
the
reflection
of
the
early
stage
of
inquiry
and
sure
to
be
remedied
in
the
not
too
distant
future
(Dennett
1991
,
Searle
1992
,
P
.


M
.

Churchland
1995)
.


To
dualists
,
those
same
impasses
will
signify
the
bankruptcy
of
the
physicalist
program
and
the
need
to
recognize
consciousness
as
a
fundamental
constituent
of
reality
in
its
own
right
(Robinson
1982
,
Foster
1989
,
1996
,
Chalmers
1996)
.


What
one
sees
depends
in
part
on
where
one
stands
,
and
the
ongoing
project
of
explaining
consciousness
will
be
accompanied
by
continuing
debate
about
its
status
and
prospects
for
success
.

.


The
functional
question
:
Why
does
consciousness
exist
?



The
functional
or
Why
question
asks
about
the
value
or
role
or
consciousness
and
thus
indirectly
about
its
origin
.


Does
it
have
a
function
,
and
if
so
what
is
it
?


Does
it
make
a
difference
to
the
operation
of
systems
in
which
it
is
present
,
and
if
so
why
and
how
?


If
consciousness
exists
as
a
complex
feature
of
biological
systems
,
then
its
adaptive
value
is
likely
relevant
to
explaining
its
evolutionary
origin
,
though
of
course
its
present
function
,
if
it
has
one
,
need
not
be
the
same
as
that
it
may
have
had
when
it
first
arose
.


Adaptive
functions
often
change
over
biological
time
.


Questions
about
the
value
of
consciousness
also
have
a
moral
dimension
in
at
least
two
ways
.


We
are
inclined
to
regard
an
organism
'
s
moral
status
as
at
least
partly
determined
by
the
nature
and
extent
to
which
it
is
conscious
,
and
conscious
states
,
especially
conscious
affective
states
such
as
pleasures
and
pains
,
play
a
major
role
in
many
of
the
accounts
of
value
that
underlie
moral
theory
(Singer
1975)
.



As
with
the
What
and
How
questions
,
the
Why
question
poses
a
general
problem
that
subdivides
into
a
diversity
of
more
specific
inquiries
.


In
so
far
as
the
various
sorts
of
consciousness
,
e
.

g
.


,
access
,
phenomenal
,
meta-mental
,
are
distinct
and
separable—which
remains
an
open
question—they
likely
also
differ
in
their
specific
roles
and
values
.


Thus
the
Why
question
may
well
not
have
a
single
or
uniform
answer
.

1
Causal
status
of
consciousness

Perhaps
the
most
basic
issue
posed
by
any
version
of
the
Why
question
is
whether
or
not
consciousness
of
the
relevant
sort
has
any
causal
impact
at
all
.


If
it
has
no
effects
and
makes
no
causal
difference
whatsoever
,
then
it
would
seem
unable
to
play
any
significant
role
in
the
systems
or
organisms
in
which
it
is
present
,
thus
undercutting
at
the
outset
most
inquiries
about
its
possible
value
.


Nor
can
the
threat
of
epiphenomenal
irrelevance
be
simply
dismissed
as
an
obvious
non-option
,
since
at
least
some
forms
of
consciousness
have
been
seriously
alleged
in
the
recent
literature
to
lack
causal
status
.


(See
the
entry
on
epiphenomenalism
.

)
Such
worries
have
been
raised
especially
with
regard
to
qualia
and
qualitative
consciousness
(Huxley
1874
,
Jackson
1982
,
Chalmers
1996)
,
but
challenges
have
also
been
leveled
against
the
causal
status
of
other
sorts
including
meta-mental
consciousness
(Velmans
1991)
.



Both
metaphysical
and
empirical
arguments
have
been
given
in
support
of
such
claims
.


Among
the
former
are
those
that
appeal
to
intuitions
about
the
conceivability
and
logical
possibility
of
zombies
,
i
.

e
.


,
of
beings
whose
behavior
,
functional
organization
,
and
physical
structure
down
to
the
molecular
level
are
identical
to
those
of
normal
human
agents
but
who
lack
any
qualia
or
qualitative
consciousness
.


Some
(Kirk
1970
,
Chalmers
1996)
assert
such
beings
are
possible
in
worlds
that
share
all
our
physical
laws
,
but
others
deny
it
(Dennett
1991
,
Levine
2001)
.


If
they
are
possible
in
such
worlds
,
then
it
would
seem
to
follow
that
even
in
our
world
,
qualia
do
not
affect
the
course
of
physical
events
including
those
that
constitute
our
human
behaviors
.


If
those
events
unfold
in
the
same
way
whether
or
not
qualia
are
present
,
then
qualia
appear
to
be
inert
or
epiphenomenal
at
least
with
respect
to
events
in
the
physical
world
.


However
,
such
arguments
and
the
zombie
intuitions
on
which
they
rely
are
controversial
and
their
soundness
remains
in
dispute
(Searle
1992
,
Yablo
1998
,
Balog
1999)
.



Arguments
of
a
far
more
empirical
sort
have
challenged
the
causal
status
of
meta-mental
consciousness
,
at
least
in
so
far
as
its
presence
can
be
measured
by
the
ability
to
report
on
one
'
s
mental
state
.


Scientific
evidence
is
claimed
to
show
that
consciousness
of
that
sort
is
neither
necessary
for
any
type
of
mental
ability
nor
does
it
occur
early
enough
to
act
as
a
cause
of
the
acts
or
processes
typically
thought
to
be
its
effects
(Velmans
1991)
.


According
to
those
who
make
such
arguments
,
the
sorts
of
mental
abilities
that
are
typically
thought
to
require
consciousness
can
all
be
realized
unconsciously
in
the
absence
of
the
supposedly
required
self-awareness
.



Moreover
,
even
when
conscious
self-awareness
is
present
,
it
allegedly
occurs
too
late
to
be
the
cause
of
the
relevant
actions
rather
than
their
result
or
at
best
a
joint
effect
of
some
shared
prior
cause
(Libet
1985)
.


Self-awareness
or
meta-mental
consciousness
according
to
these
arguments
turns
out
to
be
a
psychological
after-effect
rather
than
an
initiating
cause
,
more
like
a
post
facto
printout
or
the
result
displayed
on
one
'
s
computer
screen
than
like
the
actual
processor
operations
that
produce
both
the
computer
'
s
response
and
its
display
.



Once
again
the
arguments
are
controversial
,
and
both
the
supposed
data
and
their
interpretation
are
subjects
of
lively
disagreement
(see
Flanagan
1992
,
and
commentaries
accompanying
Velmans
1991)
.


Though
the
empirical
arguments
,
like
the
zombie
claims
,
require
one
to
consider
seriously
whether
some
forms
of
consciousness
may
be
less
causally
potent
than
is
typically
assumed
,
many
theorists
regard
the
empirical
data
as
no
real
threat
to
the
causal
status
of
consciousness
.



If
the
epiphenomenalists
are
wrong
and
consciousness
,
in
its
various
forms
,
is
indeed
causal
,
what
sorts
of
effects
does
it
have
and
what
differences
does
it
make
?


How
do
mental
processes
that
involve
the
relevant
sort
of
consciousness
differ
form
those
that
lack
it
?


What
function(s)
might
consciousness
play
?


The
following
six
sections
(6
.

2–6
.

7)
discuss
some
of
the
more
commonly
given
answers
.


Though
the
various
functions
overlap
to
some
degree
,
each
is
distinct
,
and
they
differ
as
well
in
the
sorts
of
consciousness
with
which
each
is
most
aptly
linked
.

2
Flexible
control

Increased
flexibility
and
sophistication
of
control
.


Conscious
mental
processes
appear
to
provide
highly
flexible
and
adaptive
forms
of
control
.


Though
unconscious
automatic
processes
can
be
extremely
efficient
and
rapid
,
they
typically
operate
in
ways
that
are
more
fixed
and
predetermined
than
those
which
involve
conscious
self-awareness
(Anderson
1983)
.


Conscious
awareness
is
thus
of
most
importance
when
one
is
dealing
with
novel
situations
and
previously
unencountered
problems
or
demands
(Penfield
1975
,
Armstrong
1981)
.



Standard
accounts
of
skill
acquisition
stress
the
importance
of
conscious
awareness
during
the
initial
learning
phase
,
which
gradually
gives
way
to
more
automatic
processes
of
the
sort
that
require
little
attention
or
conscious
oversight
(Schneider
and
Shiffrin
1977)
.


Conscious
processing
allows
for
the
construction
or
compilation
of
specifically
tailored
routines
out
of
elementary
units
as
well
as
for
the
deliberate
control
of
their
execution
.



There
is
a
familiar
tradeoff
between
flexibility
and
speed
;
controlled
conscious
processes
purchase
their
customized
versatility
at
the
price
of
being
slow
and
effortful
in
contrast
to
the
fluid
rapidity
of
automatic
unconscious
mental
operations
(Anderson
1983)
.


The
relevant
increases
in
flexibility
would
seem
most
closely
connected
with
the
meta-mental
or
higher-order
form
of
consciousness
in
so
far
as
the
enhanced
ability
to
control
processes
depends
upon
greater
self-awareness
.


However
,
flexibility
and
sophisticated
modes
of
control
may
be
associated
as
well
with
the
phenomenal
and
access
forms
of
consciousness
.

3
Social
coordination

Enhanced
capacity
for
social
coordination
.


Consciousness
of
the
meta-mental
sort
may
well
involve
not
only
an
increase
in
self-awareness
but
also
an
enhanced
understanding
of
the
mental
states
of
other
minded
creatures
,
especially
those
of
other
members
of
one
'
s
social
group
(Humphreys
1982)
.


Creatures
that
are
conscious
in
the
relevant
meta-mental
sense
not
only
have
beliefs
,
motives
,
perceptions
and
intentions
but
understand
what
it
is
to
have
such
states
and
are
aware
of
both
themselves
and
others
as
having
them
.



This
increase
in
mutually
shared
knowledge
of
each
other
'
s
minds
,
enables
the
relevant
organisms
to
interact
,
cooperate
and
communicate
in
more
advanced
and
adaptive
ways
.


Although
meta-mental
consciousness
is
the

most
obviously
linked
to
such
a
socially
coordinative
role
,
narrative
consciousness
of
the
kind
associated
with
the
stream
of
consciousness
is
also
clearly
relevant
in
so
far
as
it
involves
the

'
s
own
case
of
the
interpretative
abilities
that
derive
in
part
from
their
social
application
(Ryle

,
Dennett
1978

1992)

Integrated
representation

More
unified
and
densely
integrated
representation
of
reality
.


Conscious
experience
presents
us
with
a
world
of
objects
independently
existing
in
space
and
time
.


Those
objects
are
typically
present
to
us
in
a
multi-modal
fashion
that
involves
the
integration
of
information
from
various
sensory
channels
as
well
as
from
background
knowledge
and
memory
.


Conscious
experience
presents
us
not
with
isolated
properties
or
features
but
with
objects
and
events
situated
in
an
ongoing
independent
world
,
and
it
does
so
by
embodying
in
its
experiential
organization
and
dynamics
the
dense
network
of
relations
and
interconnections
that
collectively
constitute
the
meaningful
structure
of
a
world
of
objects
(Kant
1787
,
Husserl
1913
,
Campbell
1997)
.



Of
course
,
not
all
sensory
information
need
be
experienced
to
have
an
adaptive
effect
on
behavior
.


Adaptive
non-experiential
sensory-motor
links
can
be
found
both
in
simple
organisms
,
as
well
as
in
some
of
the
more
direct
and
reflexive
processes
of
higher
organisms
.


But
when
experience
is
present
,
it
provides
a
more
unified
and
integrated
representation
of
reality
,
one
that
typically
allows
for
more
open-ended
avenues
of
response
(Lorenz
1977)
.


Consider
for
example
the
representation
of
space
in
an
organism
whose
sensory
input
channels
are
simply
linked
to
movement
or
to
the
orientation
of
a
few
fixed
mechanisms
such
as
those
for
feeding
or
grabbing
prey
,
and
compare
it
with
that
in
an
organism
capable
of
using
its
spatial
information
for
flexible
navigation
of
its
environment
and
for
whatever
other
spatially
relevant
aims
or
goals
it
may
have
,
as
when
a
person
visually
scans
her
office
or
her
kitchen
(Gallistel
1990)
.



It
is
representation
of
this
latter
sort
that
is
typically
made
available
by
the
integrated
mode
of
presentation
associated
with
conscious
experience
.


The
unity
of
experienced
space
is
just
one
example
of
the
sort
of
integration
associated
with
our
conscious
awareness
of
an
objective
world
.


(See
the
entry
on
unity
of
consciousness
.

)

This
integrative
role
or
value
is
most
directly
associated
with
access
consciousness
,
but
also
clearly
with
the
larger
phenomenal
and
intentional
structure
of
experience
.


It
is
relevant
even
to
the
qualitative
aspect
of
consciousness
in
so
far
as
qualia
play
an
important
role
in
our
experience
of
unified
objects
in
a
unified
space
or
scene
.


It
is
intimately
tied
as
well
to
the
transparency
of
experience
described
in
response
to
the
What
question
,
especially
to
semantic
transparency
(Van
Gulick
1993)
.


Integration
of
information
plays
a
major
role
in
several
current
neuro-cognitive
theories
of
consciousness
especially
Global
Workspace
theories
(see
section
9
.

and
Giulio
Tononi
'
s
Integrated
Information
theory
(section

Informational
access

More
global
informational
access
.


The
information
carried
in
conscious
mental
states
is
typically
available
for
use
by
a
diversity
of
mental
subsystems
and
for
application
to
a
wide
range
of
potential
situations
and
actions
(Baars
1988)
.


Nonconscious
information
is
more
likely
to
be
encapsulated
within
particular
mental
modules
and
available
for
use
only
with
respect
to
the
applications
directly
connected
to
that
subsystem
'
s
operation
(Fodor
1983)
.


Making
information
conscious
typically
widens
the
sphere
of
its
influence
and
the
range
of
ways
it
which
it
can
be
used
to
adaptively
guide
or
shape
both
inner
and
outer
behavior
.


A
state
'
s
being
conscious
may
be
in
part
a
matter
of
what
Dennett
calls
“cerebral
celebrity”
,
i
.

e
.


,
of
its
ability
to
have
a
content-appropriate
impact
on
other
mental
states
.



This
particular
role
is
most
directly
and
definitionally
tied
to
the
notion
of
access
consciousness
(Block
1995)
,
but
meta-mental
consciousness
as
well
as
the
phenomenal
and
qualitative
forms
all
seem
plausibly
linked
to
such
increases
in
the
availability
of
information
(Armstrong
1981
,
Tye
1985)
.


Diverse
cognitive
and
neuro-cognitive
theories
incorporate
access
as
a
central
feature
of
consciousness
and
conscious
processing
.


Global
Workspace
theories

Prinz
'
s
Attendend
Intermediate
Representation
(AIR)
(Prinz

and
Tononi
'
s
Integrated
Information
Theory
(IIT)
all
distinguish
conscious
states
and
processes
at
least
partly
in
terms
of
enhanced
wide
spread
access
to
the
state

Freedom
of
will

Increased
freedom
of
choice
or
free
will
.


The
issue
of
free
will
remains
a
perennial
philosophical
problem
,
not
only
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
it
exists
but
even
as
to
what
it
might
or
should
consist
in
(Dennett
1984
,
van
Inwagen
1983
,
Hasker
1999
,
Wegner
2002)
.


(See
the
entry
on
free
will
.

)
The
notion
of
free
will
may
itself
remain
too
murky
and
contentious
to
shed
any
clear
light
on
the
role
of
consciousness
,
but
there
is
a
traditional
intuition
that
the
two
are
deeply
linked
.



Consciousness
has
been
thought
to
open
a
realm
of
possibilities
,
a
sphere
of
options
within
which
the
conscious
self
might
choose
or
act
freely
.


At
a
minimum
,
consciousness
might
seem
a
necessary
precondition
for
any
such
freedom
or
self-determination
(Hasker
1999)
.


How
could
one
engage
in
the
requisite
sort
of
free
choice
,
while
remaining
solely
within
the
unconscious
domain
?


How
can
one
determine
one
'
s
own
will
without
being
conscious
of
it
and
of
the
options
one
has
to
shape
it
.



The
freedom
to
chose
one
'
s
actions
and
the
ability
to
determine
one
'
s
own
nature
and
future
development
may
admit
of
many
interesting
variations
and
degrees
rather
than
being
a
simple
all
or
nothing
matter
,
and
various
forms
or
levels
of
consciousness
might
be
correlated
with
corresponding
degrees
or
types
of
freedom
and
self-determination
(Dennett
1984
,
2003)
.


The
link
with
freedom
seems
strongest
for
the
meta-mental
form
of
consciousness
given
its
emphasis
on
self-awareness
,
but
potential
connections
also
seem
possible
for
most
of
the
other
sorts
as
well
.

Intrinsic
motivation

Intrinsically
motivating
states
.


At
least
some
conscious
states
appear
to
have
the
motive
force
they
do
intrinsically
.


In
particular
,
the
functional
and
motivational
roles
of
conscious
affective
states
,
such
as
pleasures
and
pains
,
seem
intrinsic
to
their
experiential
character
and
inseparable
from
their
qualitative
and
phenomenal
properties
,
though
the
view
has
been
challenged
(Nelkin
1989
,
Rosenthal
1991)
.


The
attractive
positive
motivational
aspect
of
a
pleasure
seems
a
part
of
its
directly
experienced
phenomenal
feel
,
as
does
the
negative
affective
character
of
a
pain
,
at
least
in
the
case
of
normal
non-pathological
experience
.



There
is
considerable
disagreement
about
the
extent
to
which
the
feel
and
motive
force
of
pain
can
dissociate
in
abnormal
cases
,
and
some
have
denied
the
existence
of
such
intrinsically
motivating
aspects
altogether
(Dennett
1991)
.


However
,
at
least
in
the
normal
case
,
the
negative
motivational
force
of
pain
seems
built
right
into
the
feel
of
the
experience
itself
.



Just
how
this
might
be
so
remains
less
than
clear
,
and
perhaps
the
appearance
of
intrinsic
and
directly
experienced
motivational
force
is
illusory
.


But
if
it
is
real
,
then
it
may
be
one
of
the
most
important
and
evolutionarily
oldest
respects
in
which
consciousness
makes
a
difference
to
the
mental
systems
and
processes
in
which
it
is
present
(Humphreys
1992)
.



Other
suggestions
have
been
made
about
the
possible
roles
and
value
of
consciousness
,
and
these
six
surely
do
not
exhaust
the
options
.


Nonetheless
,
they
are
among
the
most
prominent
recent
hypotheses
,
and
they
provide
a
fair
survey
of
the
sorts
of
answers
that
have
been
offered
to
the
Why
question
by
those
who
believe
consciousness
does
indeed
make
a
difference
.

8
Constitutive
and
contingent
roles

One
further
point
requires
clarification
about
the
various
respects
in
which
the
proposed
functions
might
answer
the
Why
question
.


In
particular
one
should
distinguish
between
constitutive
cases
and
cases
of
contingent
realization
.


In
the
former
,
fulfilling
the
role
constitutes
being
conscious
in
the
relevant
sense
,
while
in
the
latter
case
consciousness
of
a
given
sort
is
just
one
way
among
several
in
which
the
requisite
role
might
be
realized
(Van
Gulick
1993)
.



For
example
,
making
information
globally
available
for
use
by
a
wide
variety
of
subsystems
and
behavioral
applications
may
constitute
its
being
conscious
in
the
access
sense
.


By
contrast
,
even
if
the
qualitative
and
phenomenal
forms
of
consciousness
involve
a
highly
unified
and
densely
integrated
representation
of
objective
reality
,
it
may
be
possible
to
produce
representations
having
those
functional
characteristics
but
which
are
not
qualitative
or
phenomenal
in
nature
.



The
fact
that
in
us
the
modes
of
representation
with
those
characteristics
also
have
qualitative
and
phenomenal
properties
may
reflect
contingent
historical
facts
about
the
particular
design
solution
that
happened
to
arise
in
our
evolutionary
ancestry
.


If
so
,
there
may
be
quite
other
means
of
achieving
a
comparable
result
without
qualitative
or
phenomenal
consciousness
.


Whether
this
is
the
right
way
to
think
about
phenomenal
and
qualitative
conscious
is
unclear
;
perhaps
the
tie
to
unified
and
densely
integrated
representation
is
in
fact
as
intimate
and
constitutive
as
it
seems
to
be
in
the
case
of
access
consciousness
(Carruthers
2000)
.


Regardless
of
how
that
issue
gets
resolved
,
it
is
important
to
not
to
conflate
constitution
accounts
with
contingent
realization
accounts
when
addressing
the
function
of
consciousness
and
answering
the
question
of
why
it
exists
(Chalmers
1996)
.

Theories
of
consciousness

In
response
to
the
What
,
How
and
Why
questions
many
theories
of
consciousness
have
been
proposed
in
recent
years
.


However
,
not
all
theories
of
consciousness
are
theories
of
the
same
thing
.


They
vary
not
only
in
the
specific
sorts
of
consciousness
they
take
as
their
object
,
but
also
in
their
theoretical
aims
.



Perhaps
the
largest
division
is
between
general
metaphysical
theories
that
aim
to
locate
consciousness
in
the
overall
ontological
scheme
of
reality
and
more
specific
theories
that
offer
detailed
accounts
of
its
nature
,
features
and
role
.


The
line
between
the
two
sorts
of
theories
blurs
a
bit
,
especially
in
so
far
as
many
specific
theories
carry
at
least
some
implicit
commitments
on
the
more
general
metaphysical
issues
.


Nonetheless
,
it
is
useful
to
keep
the
division
in
mind
when
surveying
the
range
of
current
theoretical
offerings
.

Metaphysical
theories
of
consciousness

General
metaphysical
theories
offer
answers
to
the
conscious
version
of
the
mind-body
problem
,
“What
is
the
ontological
status
of
consciousness
relative
to
the
world
of
physical
reality
?

”
The
available
responses
largely
parallel
the
standard
mind-body
options
including
the
main
versions
of
dualism
and
physicalism
.

Dualist
theories

Dualist
theories
regard
at
least
some
aspects
of
consciousness
as
falling
outside
the
realm
of
the
physical
,but
specific
forms
of
dualism
differ
in
just
which
aspects
those
are
.


(See
the
entry
on
dualism
.

)

Substance
dualism
,
such
as
traditional
Cartesian
dualism
(Descartes
1644)
,
asserts
the
existence
of
both
physical
and
non-physical
substances
.


Such
theories
entail
the
existence
of
non-physical
minds
or
selves
as
entities
in
which
consciousness
inheres
.


Though
substance
dualism
is
at
present
largely
out
of
favor
,
it
does
have
some
contemporary
proponents
(Swinburne
1986
,
Foster
1989
,
1996)
.



Property
dualism
in
its
several
versions
enjoys
a
greater
level
of
current
support
.


All
such
theories
assert
the
existence
of
conscious
properties
that
are
neither
identical
with
nor
reducible
to
physical
properties
but
which
may
nonetheless
be
instantiated
by
the
very
same
things
that
instantiate
physical
properties
.


In
that
respect
they
might
be
classified
as
dual
aspect
theories
.


They
take
some
parts
of
reality—organisms
,
brains
,
neural
states
or
processes—to
instantiate
properties
of
two
distinct
and
disjoint
sorts
:
physical
ones
and
conscious
,
phenomenal
or
qualitative
ones
.


Dual
aspect
or
property
dualist
theories
can
be
of
at
least
three
different
types
.



Fundamental
property
dualism
regards
conscious
mental
properties
as
basic
constituents
of
reality
on
a
par
with
fundamental
physical
properties
such
as
electromagnetic
charge
.


They
may
interact
in
causal
and
law-like
ways
with
other
fundamental
properties
such
as
those
of
physics
,
but
ontologically
their
existence
is
not
dependent
upon
nor
derivative
from
any
other
properties
(Chalmers
1996)
.



Emergent
property
dualism
treats
conscious
properties
as
arising
from
complex
organizations
of
physical
constituents
but
as
doing
so
in
a
radical
way
such
that
the
emergent
result
is
something
over
and
above
its
physical
causes
and
is
not
a
priori
predictable
from
nor
explicable
in
terms
of
their
strictly
physical
natures
.


The
coherence
of
such
emergent
views
has
been
challenged
(Kim
1998)
but
they
have
supporters
(Hasker
1999)
.



Neutral
monist
property
dualism
treats
both
conscious
mental
properties
and
physical
properties
as
in
some
way
dependent
upon
and
derivative
from
a
more
basic
level
of
reality
,
that
in
itself
is
neither
mental
nor
physical
(Russell
1927
,
Strawson
1994)
.


However
,
if
one
takes
dualism
to
be
a
claim
about
there
being
two
distinct
realms
of
fundamental
entities
or
properties
,
then
perhaps
neutral
monism
should
not
be
classified
as
a
version
of
property
dualism
in
so
far
as
it
does
not
regard
either
mental
or
physical
properties
as
ultimate
or
fundamental
.



Panpsychism
might
be
regarded
as
a
fourth
type
of
property
dualism
in
that
it
regards
all
the
constituents
of
reality
as
having
some
psychic
,
or
at
least
proto-psychic
,
properties
distinct
from
whatever
physical
properties
they
may
have
(Nagel
1979)
.


Indeed
neutral
monism
might
be
consistently
combined
with
some
version
of
panprotopsychism
(Chalmers
1996)
according
to
which
the
proto-mental
aspects
of
micro-constituents
can
give
rise
under
suitable
conditions
of
combination
to
full
blown
consciousness
.


(See
the
entry
on
panpsychism
.

)

The
nature
of
the
relevant
proto-psychic
aspect
remains
unclear
,
and
such
theories
face
a
dilemma
if
offered
in
hope
of
answering
the
Hard
Problem
.


Either
the
proto-psychic
properties
involve
the
sort
of
qualitative
phenomenal
feel
that
generates
the
Hard
Problem
or
they
do
not
.


If
they
do
,
it
is
difficult
to
understand
how
they
could
possibly
occur
as
ubiquitous
properties
of
reality
.


How
could
an
electron
or
a
quark
have
any
such
experiential
feel
?


However
,
if
the
proto-psychic
properties
do
not
involve
any
such
feel
,
it
is
not
clear
how
they
are
any
better
able
than
physical
properties
to
account
for
qualitative
consciousness
in
solving
the
Hard
Problem
.



A
more
modest
form
of
panpsychism
has
been
advocated
by
the
neuroscientist
Giulio
Tononi
(2008)
and
endorsed
by
other
neuroscientists
including
Christof
Koch
(2012)
.


This
version
derives
from
Tononi
'
s
integrated
information
theory
(IIT)
of
consciousness
that
identifies
consciousness
with
integrated
information
which
can
exist
in
many
degrees
(see
section
9
.

6
below)
.


According
to
IIT
,
even
a
simple
indicator
device
such
as
a
single
photo
diode
possesses
some
degree
of
integrated
information
and
thus
some
limited
degree
of
consciousness
,
a
consequence
which
both
Tononi
and
Koch
embrace
as
a
form
of
panpsychism
.



A
variety
of
arguments
have
been
given
in
favor
of
dualist
and
other
anti-physicalist
theories
of
consciousness
.


Some
are
largelya
priori
in
nature
such
as
those
that
appeal
to
the
supposed
conceivability
of
zombies
(Kirk
1970
,
Chalmers
1996)
or
versions
of
the
knowledge
argument
(Jackson
1982
,
1986)
which
aim
to
reach
an
anti-physicalist
conclusion
about
the
ontology
of
consciousness
from
the
apparent
limits
on
our
ability
to
fully
understand
the
qualitative
aspects
of
conscious
experience
through
third-person
physical
accounts
of
the
brain
processes
.

for
a
contrary
view
;

on

and

:

knowledge
argument

)
Other
arguments
for
dualism
are
made
on
more
empirical
grounds
,
such
as
those
that
appeal
to
supposed
causal
gaps
in
the
chains
of
physical
causation
in
the
brain
(Eccles
and
Popper
1977)
or
those
based
on
alleged
anomalies
in
the
temporal
order
of
conscious
awareness
(Libet
1982
,
1985)
.


Dualist
arguments
of
both
sorts
have
been
much
disputed
by
physicalists
(P

2
Physicalist
theories

Most
other
metaphysical
theories
of
consciousness
are
versions
of
physicalism
of
one
familiar
sort
or
another
.



Eliminativist
theories
reductively
deny
the
existence
of
consciousness
or
at
least
the
existence
of
some
of
its
commonly
accepted
sorts
or
features
.


(See
the
entry
on
eliminative
materialism
.

)
The
radical
eliminativists
reject
the
very
notion
of
consciousness
as
muddled
or
wrong
headed
and
claim
that
the
conscious/nonconscious
distinction
fails
to
cut
mental
reality
at
its
joints
(Wilkes
1984
,
1988)
.


They
regard
the
idea
of
consciousness
as
sufficiently
off
target
to
merit
elimination
and
replacement
by
other
concepts
and
distinctions
more
reflective
of
the
true
nature
of
mind
(P
.


S
.


Churchland
1983)
.



Most
eliminativists
are
more
qualified
in
their
negative
assessment
.


Rather
than
rejecting
the
notion
outright
,
they
take
issue
only
with
some
of
the
prominent
features
that
it
is
commonly
thought
to
involve
,
such
as
qualia
(Dennett
1990
,
Carruthers
2000)
,
the
conscious
self
(Dennett
1992)
,
or
the
so
called
“Cartesian
Theater”
where
the
temporal
sequence
of
conscious
experience
gets
internally
projected
(Dennett
and
Kinsbourne
1992)
.


More
modest
eliminativists
,
like
Dennett
,
thus
typically
combine
their
qualified
denials
with
a
positive
theory
of
those
aspects
of
consciousness
they
take
as
real
,
such
as
the
Multiple
Drafts
Model
(section
9
.

3
below)
.



Identity
theory
,
at
least
strict
psycho-physical
type-type
identity
theory
,
offers
another
strongly
reductive
option
by
identifying
conscious
mental
properties
,
states
and
processes
with
physical
ones
,
most
typically
of
a
neural
or
neurophysiological
nature
.


If
having
a
qualitative
conscious
experience
of
phenomenal
red
just
is
being
in
a
brain
state
with
the
relevant
neurophysiological
properties
,
then
such
experiential
properties
are
real
but
their
reality
is
a
straight
forwardly
physical
reality
.



Type-type
identity
theory
is
so
called
because
it
identifies
mental
and
physical
types
or
properties
on
a
par
with
identifying
the
property
of
being
water
with
the
property
of
being
composed
of
H₂O
molecules
.


After
a
brief
period
of
popularity
in
the
early
days
of
contemporary
physicalism
during
the
1950s
and
60s
(Place
1956
,
Smart
1959)
it
has
been
far
less
widely
held
because
of
problems
such
as
the
multiple
realization
objection
according
to
which
mental
properties
are
more
abstract
and
thus
capable
of
being
realized
by
many
diverse
underlying
structural
or
chemical
substrates
(Fodor
1974
,
Hellman
and
Thompson
1975)
.


If
one
and
the
same
conscious
property
can
be
realized
by
different
neurophysiological
(or
even
non-neurophysiological)
properties
in
different
organisms
,
then
the
two
properties
can
not
be
strictly
identical
.



Nonetheless
the
type-type
identity
theory
has
enjoyed
a
recent
if
modest
resurgence
at
least
with
respect
to
qualia
or
qualitative
conscious
properties
.


This
has
been
in
part
because
treating
the
relevant
psycho-physical
link
as
an
identity
is
thought
by
some
to
offer
a
way
of
dissolving
the
explanatory
gap
problem
(Hill
and
McLaughlin
1998
,
Papineau
1995
,
2003)
.


They
argue
that
if
the
conscious
qualitative
property
and
the
neural
property
are
identical
,
then
there
is
no
need
to
explain
how
the
latter
causes
or
gives
rise
to
the
former
.


It
does
not
cause
it
,
it
is
it
.


And
thus
there
is
no
gap
to
bridge
,
and
no
further
explanation
is
needed
.


Identities
are
not
the
sort
of
thing
that
can
be
explained
,
since
nothing
is
identical
with
anything
but
itself
,
and
it
makes
no
sense
to
ask
why
something
is
identical
with
itself
.



However
,
others
contend
that
the
appeal
to
type-type
identity
does
not
so
obviously
void
the
need
for
explanation
(Levine
2001)
.


Even
if
two
descriptions
or
concepts
in
fact
refer
to
one
and
the
same
property
,
one
may
still
reasonably
expect
some
explanation
of
that
convergence
,
some
account
of
how
they
pick
out
one
and
the
same
thing
despite
not
initially
or
intuitively
seeming
to
do
so
.


In
other
cases
of
empirically
discovered
property
identities
,
such
as
that
of
heat
and
kinetic
energy
,
there
is
a
story
to
be
told
that
explains
the
co-referential
convergence
,
and
it
seems
fair
to
expect
the
same
in
the
psycho-physical
case
.


Thus
appealing
to
type-type
identities
may
not
in
itself
suffice
to
dissolve
the
explanatory
gap
problem
.



Most
physicalist
theories
of
consciousness
are
neither
eliminativist
nor
based
on
strict
type-type
identities
.


They
acknowledge
the
reality
of
consciousness
but
aim
to
locate
it
within
the
physical
world
on
the
basis
of
some
psycho-physical
relation
short
of
strict
property
identity
.



Among
the
common
variants
are
those
that
take
conscious
reality
to
supervene
on
the
physical
,
be
composed
of
the
physical
,
or
be
realized
by
the
physical
.



Functionalist
theories
in
particular
rely
heavily
on
the
notion
of
realization
to
explicate
the
relation
between
consciousness
and
the
physical
.


According
to
functionalism
,
a
state
or
process
counts
as
being
of
a
given
mental
or
conscious
type
in
virtue
of
the
functional
role
it
plays
within
a
suitably
organized
system
(Block
1980a)
.


A
given
physical
state
realizes
the
relevant
conscious
mental
type
by
playing
the
appropriate
role
within
the
larger
physical
system
that
contains
it
.


(See
the
entry
on
functionalism
.

)
The
functionalist
often
appeals
to
analogies
with
other
inter-level
relations
,
as
between
the
biological
and
biochemical
or
the
chemical
and
the
atomic
.


In
each
case
properties
or
facts
at
one
level
are
realized
by
complex
interactions
between
items
at
an
underlying
level
.



Critics
of
functionalism
often
deny
that
consciousness
can
be
adequately
explicated
in
functional
terms
(Block
1980a
,
1980b
,
Levine
1983
,
Chalmers
1996)
.


According
to
such
critics
,
consciousness
may
have
interesting
functional
characteristics
but
its
nature
is
not
essentially
functional
.


Such
claims
are
sometimes
supported
by
appeal
to
the
supposed
possibility
of
absent
or
inverted
qualia
,
i
.

e
.


,
the
possibility
of
beings
who
are
functionally
equivalent
to
normal
humans
but
who
have
reversed
qualia
or
none
at
all
.


The
status
of
such
possibilities
is
controversial
(Shoemaker
1981
,
Dennett
1990
,
Carruthers
2000)
,
but
if
accepted
they
would
seem
to
pose
a
problem
for
the
functionalist
.


(See
the
entry
on
qualia
.

)

Those
who
ground
ontological
physicalism
on
the
realization
relation
often
combine
it
with
a
nonreductive
view
at
the
conceptual
or
representational
level
that
stresses
the
autonomy
of
the
special
sciences
and
the
distinct
modes
of
description
and
cognitive
access
they
provide
.



Non-reductive
physicalism
of
this
sort
denies
that
the
theoretical
and
conceptual
resources
appropriate
and
adequate
for
dealing
with
facts
at
the
level
of
the
underlying
substrate
or
realization
level
must
be
adequate
as
well
for
dealing
with
those
at
the
realized
level
(Putnam
1975
,
Boyd
1980)
.


As
noted
above
in
response
to
the
How
question
,
one
can
believe
that
all
economic
facts
are
physically
realized
without
thinking
that
the
resources
of
the
physical
sciences
provide
all
the
cognitive
and
conceptual
tools
we
need
for
doing
economics
(Fodor
1974)
.



Nonreductive
physicalism
has
been
challenged
for
its
alleged
failure
to
“pay
its
physicalist
dues”
in
reductive
coin
.


It
is
faulted
for
supposedly
not
giving
an
adequate
account
of
how
conscious
properties
are
or
could
be
realized
by
underlying
neural
,
physical
or
functional
structures
or
processes
(Kim
1987
,
1998)
.


Indeed
it
has
been
charged
with
incoherence
because
of
its
attempt
to
combine
a
claim
of
physical
realization
with
the
denial
of
the
ability
to
spell
out
that
relation
in
a
strict
and
a
priori
intelligible
way
(Jackson
2004)
.



However
,
as
noted
above
in
discussion
of
the
How
question
,
nonreductive
physicalists
reply
by
agreeing
that
some
account
of
psycho-physical
realization
is
indeed
needed
,
but
adding
that
the
relevant
account
may
fall
far
short
of
a
priori
deducibility
,
yet
still
suffice
to
satisfy
our
legitimate
explanatory
demands
(McGinn
1991
,
Van
Gulick
1985)
.


The
issue
remains
under
debate
.

Specific
Theories
of
Consciousness

Although
there
are
many
general
metaphysical/ontological
theories
of
consciousness
,
the
list
of
specific
detailed
theories
about
its
nature
is
even
longer
and
more
diverse
.


No
brief
survey
could
be
close
to
comprehensive
,
but
seven
main
types
of
theories
may
help
to
indicate
the
basic
range
of
options
:
higher-order
theories
,
representational
theories
,
interpretative
narrative
theories
,
cognitive
theories
,
neural
theories
,
quantum
theories
and
nonphysical
theories
.


The
categories
are
not
mutually
exclusive
;
for
example
,
many
cognitive
theories
also
propose
a
neural
substrate
for
the
relevant
cognitive
processes
.


Nonetheless
grouping
them
in
the
seven
classes
provides
a
basic
overview
.

1
Higher-order
theories

Higher-order
(HO)
theories
analyze
the
notion
of
a
conscious
mental
state
in
terms
of
reflexive
meta-mental
self-awareness
.


The
core
idea
is
that
what
makes
a
mental
state
M
a
conscious
mental
state
is
the
fact
that
it
is
accompanied
by
a
simultaneous
and
non-inferential
higher-order
(i
.

e
.


,
meta-mental)
state
whose
content
is
that
one
is
now
in
M
.


Having
a
conscious
desire
for
some
chocolate
involves
being
in
two
mental
states
;
one
must
have
both
a
desire
for
some
chocolate
and
also
a
higher-order
state
whose
content
is
that
one
is
now
having
just
such
a
desire
.


Unconscious
mental
states
are
unconscious
precisely
in
that
we
lack
the
relevant
higher-order
states
about
them
.


Their
being
unconscious
consists
in
the
fact
that
we
are
not
reflexively
and
directly
aware
of
being
in
them
.


(See
the
entry
on
higher-order
theories
of
consciousness
.

)

Higher-order
theories
come
in
two
main
variants
that
differ
concerning
the
psychological
mode
of
the
relevant
conscious-making
meta-mental
states
.


Higher-order
thought
(HOT)
theories
take
the
required
higher-order
state
to
be
an
assertoric
thought-like
meta-state
(Rosenthal
1986
,
1993)
.


Higher-order
perception
(HOP)
theories
take
them
to
be
more
perception-like
and
associated
with
a
kind
of
inner
sense
and
intra-mental
monitoring
systems
of
some
sort
(Armstrong
1981
,
Lycan
1987
,
1996)
.



Each
has
its
relative
strengths
and
problems
.


HOT
theorists
note
that
we
have
no
organs
of
inner
sense
and
claim
that
we
experience
no
sensory
qualities
other
than
those
presented
to
us
by
outer
directed
perception
.


HOP
theorists
on
the
other
hand
can
argue
that
their
view
explains
some
of
the
additional
conditions
required
by
HO
accounts
as
natural
consequences
of
the
perception-like
nature
of
the
relevant
higher-order
states
.


In
particular
the
demands
that
the
conscious-making
meta-state
be
noninferential
and
simultaneous
with
its
lower
level
mental
object
might
be
explained
by
the
parallel
conditions
that
typically
apply
to
perception
.


We
perceive
what
is
happening
now
,
and
we
do
so
in
a
way
that
involves
no
inferences
,
at
least
not
any
explicit
personal-level
inferences
.


Those
conditions
are
no
less
necessary
on
the
HOT
view
but
are
left
unexplained
by
it
,
which
might
seem
to
give
some
explanatory
advantage
to
the
HOP
model
(Lycan
2004
,
Van
Gulick
2000)
,
though
some
HOT
theorists
argue
otherwise
(Carruthers
2000)
.



Whatever
their
respective
merits
,
both
HOP
and
HOT
theories
face
some
common
challenges
,
including
what
might
be
called
thegenerality
problem
.


Having
a
thought
or
perception
of
a
given
item
X—be
it
a
rock
,
a
pen
or
a
potato—does
not
in
general
make
X
a
conscious
X
.


Seeing
or
thinking
of
the
potato
on
the
counter
does
not
make
it
a
conscious
potato
.


Why
then
should
having
a
thought
or
perception
of
a
given
desire
or
a
memory
make
it
a
conscious
desire
or
memory
(Dretske
1995
,
Byrne
1997)
.


Nor
will
it
suffice
to
note
that
we
do
not
apply
the
term
“conscious”
to
rocks
or
pens
that
we
perceive
or
think
of
,
but
only
to
mental
states
that
we
perceive
or
think
of
(Lycan
1997
,
Rosenthal
1997)
.


That
may
be
true
,
but
what
is
needed
is
some
account
of
why
it
is
appropriate
to
do
so
.



The
higher-order
view
is
most
obviously
relevant
to
the
meta-mental
forms
of
consciousness
,
but
some
of
its
supporters
take
it
to
explain
other
types
of
consciousness
as
well
,
including
the
more
subjective
what
it
'
s
like
and
qualitative
types
.


One
common
strategy
is
to
analyze
qualia
as
mental
features
that
are
capable
of
occurring
unconsciously
;
for
example
they
might
be
explained
as
properties
of
inner
states
whose
structured
similarity
relations
given
rise
to
beliefs
about
objective
similarities
in
the
world
(Shoemaker
1975
,
1990)
.


Though
unconscious
qualia
can
play
that
functional
role
,
there
need
be
nothing
that
it
is
like
to
be
in
a
state
that
has
them
(Nelkin
1989
,
Rosenthal
1991
,
1997)
.


According
to
the
HO
theorist
,
what-it
'
s-likeness
enters
only
when
we
become
aware
of
that
first-order
state
and
its
qualitative
properties
by
having
an
appropriate
meta-state
directed
at
it
.



Critics
of
the
HO
view
have
disputed
that
account
,
and
some
have
argued
that
the
notion
of
unconscious
qualia
on
which
it
relies
is
incoherent
(Papineau
2002)
.


Whether
or
not
such
proposed
HO
accounts
of
qualia
are
successful
,
it
is
important
to
note
that
most
HO
advocates
take
themselves
to
be
offering
a
comprehensive
theory
of
consciousness
,
or
at
least
the
core
of
such
a
general
theory
,
rather
than
merely
one
limited
to
some
special
meta-mental
forms
of
it
.



Other
variants
of
HO
theory
go
beyond
the
standard
HOT
and
HOP
versions
including
some
that
analyze
consciousness
in
terms
of
dispositional
rather
than
occurrent
higher-order
thoughts
(Carruthers
2000)
.


Others
appeal
to
implicit
rather
than
explicit
higher-order
understanding
and
weaken
or
remove
the
standard
assumption
that
the
meta-state
must
be
distinct
and
separate
from
its
lower-order
object
(Gennaro
1995
,
Van
Gulick
2000
,
2004)
with
such
views
overlapping
with
so
called
reflexive
theories
discussed
in
the
section
.


Other
variants
of
HO
theory
continue
to
be
offered
,
and
debate
between
supporters
and
critics
of
the
basic
approach
remains
active
.

Reflexive
theories

Reflexive
theories
,
like
higher-order
theories
,
imply
a
strong
link
between
consciousness
and
self-awareness
.


They
differ
in
that
they
locate
the
aspect
of
self-awareness
directly
within
the
conscious
state
itself
rather
than
in
a
distinct
meta-state
directed
at
it
.


The
idea
that
conscious
states
involve
a
double
intentionality
goes
back
at
least
to
Brentano
(1874)
in
the
19th
century
.


The
conscious
state
is
intentionally
directed
at
an
object
outside
itself—such
as
a
tree
or
chair
in
the
case
of
a
conscious
perception—as
well
as
intentionally
directed
at
itself
.


One
and
the
same
state
is
both
an
outer-directed
awareness
and
an
awareness
of
itself
.


Several
recent
theories
have
claimed
that
such
reflexive
awareness
is
a
central
feature
of
conscious
mental
states
.


Some
view
themselves
as
variants
of
higher-order
theory
(Gennaro
2004
,
2012)
while
others
reject
the
higher-order
category
and
describe
their
theories
as
presenting
a
“same-order”
account
of
consciousness
as
self-awareness
(Kriegel
2009)
.


Yet
others
challenge
the
level
distinction
by
analyzing
the
meta-intentional
content
as
implicit
in
the
phenomenal
first-order
content
of
conscious
states
,
as
in
so
called
Higher-Order
Global
State
models
(HOGS)
(Van
Gulick
2004
,2006)
.


A
sample
of
papers
,
some
supporting
and
some
attacking
the
reflexive
view
can
be
found
in
Krigel
and
Williford
(2006)
.

3
Representationalist
theories

Almost
all
theories
of
consciousness
regard
it
as
having
representational
features
,
but
so
called
representationalist
theories
are
defined
by
the
stronger
view
that
its
representational
features
exhaust
its
mental
features
(Harman
1990
,
Tye
1995
,
2000)
.


According
to
the
representationalist
,
conscious
mental
states
have
no
mental
properties
other
than
their
representational
properties
.


Thus
two
conscious
or
experiential
states
that
share
all
their
representational
properties
will
not
differ
in
any
mental
respect
.



The
exact
force
of
the
claim
depends
on
how
one
interprets
the
idea
of
being
“representationally
the
same”
for
which
there
are
many
plausible
alternative
criteria
.


One
could
define
it
coarsely
in
terms
of
satisfaction
or
truth
conditions
,
but
understood
in
that
way
the
representationalist
thesis
seems
clearly
false
.


There
are
too
many
ways
in
which
states
might
share
their
satisfaction
or
truth
conditions
yet
differ
mentally
,
including
those
that
concern
their
mode
of
conceptualizing
or
presenting
those
conditions
.



At
the
opposite
extreme
,
one
could
count
two
states
as
representationally
distinct
if
they
differed
in
any
features
that
played
a
role
in
their
representational
function
or
operation
.


On
such
a
liberal
reading
any
differences
in
the
bearers
of
content
would
count
as
representational
differences
even
if
they
bore
the
same
intentional
or
representational
content
;
they
might
differ
only
in
their
means
or
mode
of
representation
not
their
content
.



Such
a
reading
would
of
course
increase
the
plausibility
of
the
claim
that
a
conscious
state
'
s
representational
properties
exhaust
its
mental
properties
but
at
the
cost
of
significantly
weakening
or
even
trivializing
the
thesis
.


Thus
the
representationalist
seems
to
need
an
interpretation
of
representational
sameness
that
goes
beyond
mere
satisfaction
conditions
and
reflects
all
the
intentional
or
contentful
aspects
of
representation
without
being
sensitive
to
mere
differences
in
underlying
non-contentful
features
of
the
processes
at
the
realization
level
.


Thus
most
representationalists
provide
conditions
for
conscious
experience
that
include
both
a
content
condition
plus
some
further
causal
role
or
format
requirements
(Tye
1995
,
Dretske
1995
,
Carruthers
2000)
.


Other
representationalists
accept
the
existence
of
qualia
but
treat
them
as
objective
properties
that
external
objects
are
represented
as
having
,
i
.

e
.


,
they
treat
them
as
represented
properties
rather
than
as
properties
of
representations
or
mental
states
(Dretske
1995
,
Lycan
1996)
.



Representationalism
can
be
understood
as
a
qualified
form
of
eliminativism
insofar
as
it
denies
the
existence
of
properties
of
a
sort
that
conscious
mental
states
are
commonly
thought
to
have—or
at
least
seem
to
have—namely
those
that
are
mental
but
not
representational
.


Qualia
,
at
least
if
understood
as
intrinsic
monadic
properties
of
conscious
states
accessible
to
introspection
,
would
seem
to
be
the
most
obvious
targets
for
such
elimination
.


Indeed
part
of
the
motivation
for
representationalism
is
to
show
that
one
can
accommodate
all
the
facts
about
consciousness
,
perhaps
within
a
physicalist
framework
,
without
needing
to
find
room
for
qualia
or
any
other
apparently
non-representational
mental
properties
(Dennett
1990
,
Lycan
1996
,
Carruthers
2000)
.



Representationalism
has
been
quite
popular
in
recent
years
and
had
many
defenders
,
but
it
remains
highly
controversial
and
intuitions
clash
about
key
cases
and
thought
experiments
(Block
1996)
.


In
particular
the
possibility
of
inverted
qualia
provides
a
crucial
test
case
.


To
anti-representationalists
,
the
mere
logical
possibility
of
inverted
qualia
shows
that
conscious
states
can
differ
in
a
significant
mental
respect
while
coinciding
representationally
.


Representationalists
in
reply
deny
either
the
possibility
of
such
inversion
or
its
alleged
import
(Dretske
1995
,
Tye
2000)
.



Many
other
arguments
have
been
made
for
and
against
representationalism
,
such
as
those
concerning
perceptions
in
different
sense
modalities
of
one
and
the
same
state
of
affairs—seeing
and
feeling
the
same
cube—which
might
seem
to
involve
mental
differences
distinct
from
how
the
relevant
states
represent
the
world
to
be
(Peacocke
1983
,
Tye
2003)
.


In
each
case
,
both
sides
can
muster
strong
intuitions
and
argumentative
ingenuity
.


Lively
debate
continues
.

4
Narrative
Interpretative
Theories

Some
theories
of
consciousness
stress
the
interpretative
nature
of
facts
about
consciousness
.


According
to
such
views
,
what
is
or
is
not
conscious
is
not
always
a
determinate
fact
,
or
at
least
not
so
independent
of
a
larger
context
of
interpretative
judgments
.


The
most
prominent
philosophical
example
is
the
Multiple
Drafts
Model
(MDM)
of
consciousness
,
advanced
by
Daniel
Dennett
(1991)
.


It
combines
elements
of
both
representationalism
and
higher-order
theory
but
does
so
in
a
way
that
varies
interestingly
from
the
more
standard
versions
of
either
providing
a
more
interpretational
and
less
strongly
realist
view
of
consciousness
.



The
MDM
includes
many
distinct
but
interrelated
features
.


Its
name
reflects
the
fact
that
at
any
given
moment
content
fixations
of
many
sorts
are
occurring
throughout
the
brain
.


What
makes
some
of
these
contents
conscious
is
not
that
they
occur
in
a
privileged
spatial
or
functional
location—the
so
called
“Cartesian
Theater”—nor
in
a
special
mode
or
format
,
all
of
which
the
MDM
denies
.


Rather
it
a
matter
of
what
Dennett
calls
“cerebral
celebrity”
,
i
.

e
.


,
the
degree
to
which
a
given
content
influences
the
future
development
of
other
contents
throughout
the
brain
,
especially
with
regard
to
how
those
effects
are
manifest
in
the
reports
and
behaviors
that
the
person
makes
in
response
to
various
probes
that
might
indicate
her
conscious
state
.


One
of
the
MDM
'
s
key
claims
is
that
different
probes
(e
.


g
.


,
being
asked
different
questions
or
being
in
different
contexts
that
make
differing
behavioral
demands)
may
elicit
different
answers
about
the
person
'
s
conscious
state
.


Moreover
,
according
to
the
MDM
there
may
be
no
probe-independent
fact
of
the
matter
about
what
the
person
'
s
conscious
state
really
was
.


Hence
the
“multiple”
of
the
Multiple
Drafts
Model
.



The
MDM
is
representationalist
in
that
it
analyzes
consciousness
in
terms
of
content
relations
.


It
also
denies
the
existence
of
qualia
and
thus
rejects
any
attempt
to
distinguish
conscious
states
from
nonconscious
states
by
their
presence
.


It
rejects
as
well
the
notion
of
the
self
as
an
inner
observer
,
whether
located
in
the
Cartesian
Theater
or
elsewhere
.


The
MDM
treats
the
self
as
an
emergent
or
virtual
aspect
of
the
coherent
roughly
serially
narrative
that
is
constructed
through
the
interactive
play
of
contents
in
the
system
.


Many
of
those
contents
are
bound
together
at
the
intentional
level
as
perceptions
or
fixations
from
a
relatively
unified
and
temporally
extended
point
of
view
,
i
.

e
.


,
they
cohere
in
their
contents
as
if
they
were
the
experiences
of
a
ongoing
self
.


But
it
is
the
order
of
dependence
that
is
crucial
to
the
MDM
account
.


The
relevant
contents
are
not
unified
because
they
are
all
observed
by
a
single
self
,
but
just
the
converse
.


It
is
because
they
are
unified
and
coherent
at
the
level
of
content
that
they
count
as
the
experiences
of
a
single
self
,
at
least
of
a
single
virtual
self
.



It
is
in
this
respect
that
the
MDM
shares
some
elements
with
higher-order
theories
.


The
contents
that
compose
the
serial
narrative
are
at
least
implicitly
those
of
an
ongoing
if
virtual
self
,
and
it
is
they
that
are
most
likely
to
be
expressed
in
the
reports
the
person
makes
of
her
conscious
state
in
response
to
various
probes
.


They
thus
involve
a
certain
degree
of
reflexivity
or
self-awareness
of
the
sort
that
is
central
to
higher-order
theories
,
but
the
higher-order
aspect
is
more
an
implicit
feature
of
the
stream
of
contents
rather
than
present
in
distinct
explicit
higher-order
states
of
the
sort
found
in
standard
HO
theories
.



Dennett
'
s
MDM
has
been
highly
influential
but
has
also
drawn
criticism
,
especially
from
those
who
find
it
insufficiently
realist
in
its
view
of
consciousness
and
at
best
incomplete
in
achieving
its
stated
goal
to
fully
explain
it
(Block
1994
,
Dretske
1994
,
Levine
1994)
.


Many
of
its
critics
acknowledge
the
insight
and
value
of
the
MDM
,
but
deny
that
there
are
no
real
facts
of
consciousness
other
than
those
captured
by
it
(Rosenthal
1994
,
Van
Gulick
1994
,
Akins
1996)
.



From
a
more
empirical
perspective
,
the
neuroscientist
Michael
Gazzaniga
(2011)
has
introduced
the
idea
of
an
“interpreter
module”
based
in
the
left
hemisphere
that
makes
sense
of
our
actions
in
any
inferential
way
and
constructs
an
ongoing
narrative
of
our
actions
and
experience
.


Though
the
theory
is
not
intended
as
a
complete
theory
of
consciousness
,
it
accords
a
major
role
to
such
interpretative
narrative
activity
.

5
Cognitive
Theories

A
number
theories
of
consciousness
associate
it
with
a
distinct
cognitive
architecture
or
with
a
special
pattern
of
activity
with
that
structure
.



Global
Workspace
.


A
major
psychological
example
of
the
cognitive
approach
is
the
Global
Workspace
theory
.


As
initially
developed
by
Bernard
Baars
(1988))
global
workspace
theory
describes
consciousness
in
terms
of
a
competition
among
processors
and
outputs
for
a
limited
capacity
resource
that
“broadcasts”
information
for
widespread
access
and
use
.


Being
available
in
that
way
to
the
global
workspace
makes
information
conscious
at
least
in
the
access
sense
.


It
is
available
for
report
and
the
flexible
control
of
behavior
.


Much
like
Dennett
'
s
“cerebral
celebrity”
,
being
broadcast
in
the
workspace
makes
contents
more
accessible
and
influential
with
respect
to
other
contents
and
other
processors
.


At
the
same
time
the
original
content
is
strengthened
by
recurrent
support
back
from
the
workspace
and
from
other
contents
with
which
it
coheres
.


The
capacity
limits
on
the
workspace
correspond
to
the
limits
typically
placed
on
focal
attention
or
working
memory
in
many
cognitive
models
.



The
model
has
been
further
developed
with
proposed
connections
to
particular
neural
and
functional
brain
systems
by
Stanislas
Dehaene
and
others
(2000)
.


Of
special
importance
is
the
claim
that
consciousness
in
both
the
access
and
phenomenal
sense
occurs
when
and
only
when
the
relevant
content
enters
the
larger
global
network
involving
both
primary
sensory
areas
as
well
as
many
other
areas
including
frontal
and
parietal
areas
associated
with
attention
.


Dehaene
claims
that
conscious
perception
begins
only
with
the
“ignition”
of
that
larger
global
network
;
activity
in
the
primary
sensory
areas
will
not
suffice
no
matter
how
intense
or
recurrent
(though
see
the
contrary
view
of
Victor
Lamme
in
section
9
.

7)
.



Attended
Intermediate
Representation
.


Another
cognitive
theory
is
Jesse
Prinz
'
s
(2012)
Attended
Intermediate
level
Representation
theory
(AIR)
.


The
theory
is
a
neuro-cognitive
hybrid
account
of
conscious
.


According
to
AIR
theory
,
a
conscious
perception
must
meet
both
cognitive
and
neural
conditions
.


It
must
be
a
representation
of
a
perceptually
intermediate
property
which
Prinz
argues
are
the
only
properties
of
which
we
are
aware
in
conscious
experience—we
experience
only
basic
features
of
external
objects
such
as
colors
,
shapes
,
tones
,
and
feels
.


According
to
Prinz
,
our
awareness
of
higher
level
properties—such
as
being
a
pine
tree
or
my
car
keys—is
wholly
a
matter
of
judging
and
not
of
conscious
experience
.


Hence
the
Intermediate
Representational
(IR)
aspect
of
AIR
.


To
be
conscious
such
a
represented
content
must
also
be
Attended
(the
A
aspect
of
AIR)
.


Prinz
proposes
a
particular
neural
substrate
for
each
component
.


He
identifies
the
intermediate
level
representations
with
gamma
(40–80hz)
vector
activity
in
sensory
cortex
and
the
attentional
component
with
synchronized
oscillations
that
can
incorporate
that
gamma
vector
activity
.

Information
Integration
Theory

The
integration
of
information
from
many
sources
is
an
important
feature
of
consciousness
and
,
as
noted
above
(section
6
.

4)
,
is
often
cited
as
one
of
its
major
functions
.


Content
integration
plays
an
important
role
in
various
theories
especially
global
workspace
theory
(section
9
.

3)
.


However
,
a
proposal
by
the
neuroscientist
Giulio
Tononi
(2008)
goes
further
in
identifying
consciousness
with
integrated
information
and
asserting
that
information
integration
of
the
relevant
sort
is
both
necessary
and
sufficient
for
consciousness
regardless
of
the
substrate
in
which
it
is
realized
(which
need
not
be
neural
or
biological)
.


According
to
Tononi
'
s
Integrated
Information
Theory
(IIT)
,
consciousness
is
a
purely
information-theoretic
property
of
systems
.


He
proposes
a
mathematical
measure
φ
that
aims
to
measure
not
merely
the
information
in
the
parts
of
a
given
system
but
also
the
information
contained
in
the
organization
of
the
system
over
and
above
that
in
its
parts
.


φ
thus
corresponds
to
the
system
'
s
degree
of
informational
integration
.


Such
a
system
can
contain
many
overlapping
complexes
and
the
complex
with
the
highest
φ
value
will
be
conscious
according
to
IIT
.



According
to
IIT
,
consciousness
varies
in
quantity
and
comes
in
many
degrees
which
correspond
to
φ
values
.


Thus
even
a
simple
system
such
a
single
photo
diode
will
be
conscious
to
some
degree
if
it
is
not
contained
within
a
larger
complex
.


In
that
sense
,
IIT
implies
a
form
of
panpsychism
that
Tononi
explicitly
endorses
.


According
to
IIT
,
the
quality
of
the
relevant
consciousness
is
determined
by
the
totality
of
informational
relations
within
the
relevant
integrated
complex
.


Thus
IIT
aims
to
explain
both
the
quantity
and
quality
of
phenomenal
consciousness
.


Other
neuroscientists
,
notably
Christof
Koch
,
have
also
endorsed
the
IIT
approach
(Koch
2012)
.

Neural
Theories

Neural
theories
of
consciousness
come
in
many
forms
,
though
most
in
some
way
concern
the
so
called
“neural
correlates
of
consciousness”
or
NCCs
.


Unless
one
is
a
dualist
or
other
non-physicalist
,
more
than
mere
correlation
is
required
;
at
least
some
NCCs
must
be
the
essential
substrates
of
consciousness
.


An
explanatory
neural
theory
needs
to
explain
why
or
how
the
relevant
correlations
exist
,
and
if
the
theory
is
committed
to
physicalism
that
will
require
showing
how
the
underlying
neural
substrates
could
be
identical
with
their
neural
correlates
or
at
least
realize
them
by
satisfying
the
required
roles
or
conditions
(Metzinger
2000)
.



Such
theories
are
diverse
not
only
in
the
neural
processes
or
properties
to
which
they
appeal
but
also
in
the
aspects
of
consciousness
they
take
as
their
respective
explananda
.


Some
are
based
on
high-level
systemic
features
of
the
brain
,
but
others
focus
on
more
specific
physiological
or
structural
properties
,
with
corresponding
differences
in
their
intended
explanatory
targets
.


Most
in
some
way
aim
to
connect
with
theories
of
consciousness
at
other
levels
of
description
such
as
cognitive
,
representational
or
higher-order
theories
.



A
sampling
of
recent
neural
theories
might
include
models
that
appeal
to
global
integrated
fields
(Kinsbourne)
,
binding
through
synchronous
oscillation
(Singer
1999
,
Crick
and
Koch
1990)
,
NMDA-mediated
transient
neural
assemblies
(Flohr
1995)
,
thalamically
modulated
patterns
of
cortical
activation
(Llinas
2001)
,
reentrant
cortical
loops
(Edelman
1989)
,
comparator
mechanisms
that
engage
in
continuous
action-prediction-assessment
loops
between
frontal
and
midbrain
areas
(Gray
1995)
,
left
hemisphere
based
interpretative
processes
(Gazzaniga
1988)
,
and
emotive
somatosensory
hemostatic
processes
based
in
the
frontal-limbic
nexus
(Damasio
1999)
or
in
the
periaqueductal
gray
(Panksepp
1998)
.



In
each
case
the
aim
is
to
explain
how
organization
and
activity
at
the
relevant
neural
level
could
underlie
one
or
another
major
type
or
feature
of
consciousness
.


Global
fields
or
transient
synchronous
assemblies
could
underlie
the
intentional
unity
of
phenomenal
consciousness
.


NMDA-based
plasticity
,
specific
thalamic
projections
into
the
cortex
,
or
regular
oscillatory
waves
could
all
contribute
to
the
formation
of
short
term
but
widespread
neural
patterns
or
regularities
needed
to
knit
integrated
conscious
experience
out
of
the
local
activity
in
diverse
specialized
brain
modules
.


Left
hemisphere
interpretative
processes
could
provide
a
basis
for
narrative
forms
of
conscious
self-awareness
.


Thus
it
is
possible
for
multiple
distinct
neural
theories
to
all
be
true
,
with
each
contributing
some
partial
understanding
of
the
links
between
conscious
mentality
in
its
diverse
forms
and
the
active
brain
at
its
many
levels
of
complex
organization
and
structure
.



One
particular
recent
controversy
has
concerned
the
issue
of
whether
global
or
merely
local
recurrent
activity
is
sufficient
for
phenomenal
consciousness
.


Supporters
of
the
global
neuronal
workspace
model
(Dehaene
2000)
have
argued
that
consciousness
of
any
sort
can
occur
only
when
contents
are
activated
with
a
large
scale
pattern
of
recurrent
activity
involving
frontal
and
parietal
areas
as
well
as
primary
sensory
areas
of
cortex
.


Others
in
particular
the
psychologist
Victor
Lamme
(2006)
and
the
philosopher
Ned
Block
(2007)
have
argued
that
local
recurrent
activity
between
higher
and
lower
areas
within
sensory
cortex
(e
.

g
.


with
visual
cortex)
can
suffice
for
phenomenal
consciousness
even
in
the
absence
of
verbal
reportability
and
other
indicators
of
access
consciousness
.

Quantum
theories

Other
physical
theories
have
gone
beyond
the
neural
and
placed
the
natural
locus
of
consciousness
at
a
far
more
fundamental
level
,
in
particular
at
the
micro-physical
level
of
quantum
phenomena
.


According
to
such
theories
,
the
nature
and
basis
of
consciousness
can
not
be
adequately
understood
within
the
framework
of
classical
physics
but
must
be
sought
within
the
alternative
picture
of
physical
reality
provided
by
quantum
mechanics
.


The
proponents
of
the
quantum
consciousness
approach
regard
the
radically
alternative
and
often
counterintuitive
nature
of
quantum
physics
as
just
what
is
needed
to
overcome
the
supposed
explanatory
obstacles
that
confront
more
standard
attempts
to
bridge
the
psycho-physical
gap
.



Again
there
are
a
wide
range
of
specific
theories
and
models
that
have
been
proposed
,
appealing
to
a
variety
of
quantum
phenomena
to
explain
a
diversity
of
features
of
consciousness
.


It
would
be
impossible
to
catalog
them
here
or
even
explain
in
any
substantial
way
the
key
features
of
quantum
mechanics
to
which
they
appeal
.


However
,
a
brief
selective
survey
may
provide
a
sense
,
however
partial
and
obscure
,
of
the
options
that
have
been
proposed
.



The
physicist
Roger
Penrose
(1989
,
1994)
and
the
anesthesiologist
Stuart
Hameroff
(1998)
have
championed
a
model
according
to
which
consciousness
arises
through
quantum
effects
occurring
within
subcellular
structures
internal
to
neurons
known
as
microtubules
.


The
model
posits
so
called
“objective
collapses”
which
involve
the
quantum
system
moving
from
a
superposition
of
multiple
possible
states
to
a
single
definite
state
,
but
without
the
intervention
of
an
observer
or
measurement
as
in
most
quantum
mechanical
models
.


According
to
the
Penrose
and
Hameroff
,
the
environment
internal
to
the
microtubules
is
especially
suitable
for
such
objective
collapses
,
and
the
resulting
self-collapses
produce
a
coherent
flow
regulating
neuronal
activity
and
making
non-algorithmic
mental
processes
possible
.



The
psychiatrist
Ian
Marshall
has
offered
a
model
that
aims
to
explain
the
coherent
unity
of
consciousness
by
appeal
to
the
production
within
the
brain
of
a
physical
state
akin
to
that
of
a
Bose-Einstein
condensate
.


The
latter
is
a
quantum
phenomenon
in
which
a
collection
of
atoms
acts
as
a
single
coherent
entity
and
the
distinction
between
discrete
atoms
is
lost
.


While
brain
states
are
not
literally
examples
of
Bose-Einstein
condensates
,
reasons
have
been
offered
to
show
why
brains
are
likely
to
give
rise
to
states
that
are
capable
of
exhibiting
a
similar
coherence
(Marshall
and
Zohar
1990)
.



A
basis
for
consciousness
has
also
been
sought
in
the
holistic
nature
of
quantum
mechanics
and
the
phenomenon
of
entanglement
,
according
to
which
particles
that
have
interacted
continue
to
have
their
natures
depend
upon
each
other
even
after
their
separation
.


Unsurprisingly
these
models
have
been
targeted
especially
at
explaining
the
coherence
of
consciousness
,
but
they
have
also
been
invoked
as
a
more
general
challenge
to
the
atomistic
conception
of
traditional
physics
according
to
which
the
properties
of
wholes
are
to
be
explained
by
appeal
to
the
properties
of
their
parts
plus
their
mode
of
combination
,
a
method
of
explanation
that
might
be
regarded
as
unsuccessful
to
date
in
explaining
consciousness
(Silberstein
1998
,
2001)
.



Others
have
taken
quantum
mechanics
to
indicate
that
consciousness
is
an
absolutely
fundamental
property
of
physical
reality
,
one
that
needs
to
be
brought
in
at
the
very
most
basic
level
(Stapp
1993)
.


They
have
appealed
especially
to
the
role
of
the
observer
in
the
collapse
of
the
wave
function
,
i
.

e
.


,
the
collapse
of
quantum
reality
from
a
superposition
of
possible
states
to
a
single
definite
state
when
a
measurement
is
made
.


Such
models
may
or
may
not
embrace
a
form
of
quasi-idealism
,
in
which
the
very
existence
of
physical
reality
depends
upon
its
being
consciously
observed
.



There
are
many
other
quantum
models
of
consciousness
to
be
found
in
the
literature—some
advocating
a
radically
revisionist
metaphysics
and
others
not—but
these
four
provide
a
reasonable
,
though
partial
,
sample
of
the
alternatives
.

Non-physical
theories

Most
specific
theories
of
consciousness—whether
cognitive
,
neural
or
quantum
mechanical—aim
to
explain
or
model
consciousness
as
a
natural
feature
of
the
physical
world
.


However
,
those
who
reject
a
physicalist
ontology
of
consciousness
must
find
ways
of
modeling
it
as
a
nonphysical
aspect
of
reality
.


Thus
those
who
adopt
a
dualist
or
anti-physicalist
metaphysical
view
must
in
the
end
provide
specific
models
of
consciousness
different
from
the
five
types
above
.


Both
substance
dualists
and
property
dualists
must
develop
the
details
of
their
theories
in
ways
that
articulate
the
specific
natures
of
the
relevant
non-physical
features
of
reality
with
which
they
equate
consciousness
or
to
which
they
appeal
in
order
to
explain
it
.



A
variety
of
such
models
have
been
proposed
including
the
following
.


David
Chalmers
(1996)
has
offered
an
admittedly
speculative
version
of
panpsychism
which
appeals
to
the
notion
of
information
not
only
to
explain
psycho-physical
invariances
between
phenomenal
and
physically
realized
information
spaces
but
also
to
possibly
explain
the
ontology
of
the
physical
as
itself
derived
from
the
informational
(a
version
of
“it
from
bit”
theory)
.


In
a
somewhat
similar
vein
,
Gregg
Rosenberg
has
(2004)
proposed
an
account
of
consciousness
that
simultaneously
addresses
the
ultimate
categorical
basis
of
causal
relations
.


In
both
the
causal
case
and
the
conscious
case
,
Rosenberg
argues
the
relational-functional
facts
must
ultimately
depend
upon
a
categorical
non-relational
base
,
and
he
offers
a
model
according
to
which
causal
relations
and
qualitative
phenomenal
facts
both
depend
upon
the
same
base
.


Also
,
as
noted
just
above
(section
9
.

8)
,
some
quantum
theories
treat
consciousness
as
a
fundamental
feature
of
reality
(Stapp
1993)
,
and
insofar
as
they
do
so
,
they
might
be
plausibly
classified
as
non-physical
theories
as
well
.

Conclusion

A
comprehensive
understanding
of
consciousness
will
likely
require
theories
of
many
types
.


One
might
usefully
and
without
contradiction
accept
a
diversity
of
models
that
each
in
their
own
way
aim
respectively
to
explain
the
physical
,
neural
,
cognitive
,
functional
,
representational
and
higher-order
aspects
of
consciousness
.


There
is
unlikely
to
be
any
single
theoretical
perspective
that
suffices
for
explaining
all
the
features
of
consciousness
that
we
wish
to
understand
.


Thus
a
synthetic
and
pluralistic
approach
may
provide
the
best
road
to
future
progress
.

Activism
which
use
awareness
campaigns

Consciousness
raising
(also
called
awareness
raising)
is
a
form
of
activism
popularized
by
United
States
feminists
in
the
late
1960s
.


It
often
takes
the
form
of
a
group
of
people
attempting
to
focus
the
attention
of
a
wider
group
on
some
cause
or
condition
.


Common
issues
include
diseases
(e
.

g
.


breast
cancer
,
AIDS)
,
conflicts
(e
.

g
.


the
Darfur
genocide
,
global
warming)
,
movements
(e
.

g
.


Greenpeace
,
PETA
,
Earth
Hour)
and
political
parties
or
politicians
.


Since
informing
the
populace
of
a
public
concern
is
often
regarded
as
the
first
step
to
changing
how
the
institutions
handle
it
,
raising
awareness
is
often
the
first
activity
in
which
any
advocacy
group
engages
.



However
,
in
practice
,
raising
awareness
is
often
combined
with
other
activities
,
such
as
fundraising
,
membership
drives
or
advocacy
,
in
order
to
harness
and/or
sustain
the
motivation
of
new
supporters
which
may
be
at
its
highest
just
after
they
have
learned
and
digested
the
new
information
.



The
term
awareness
raising
is
used
in
the
Yogyakarta
Principles
against
discriminatory
attitudes^([1])
and
LGBT
stereotypes
as
well
as
the
Convention
on
the
Rights
of
Persons
with
Disabilities
to
combat
stereotypes
,
prejudices
and
harmful
practices
toward
people
with
disabilities
.

^([2])

Terminology

[edit]

Until
the
early-17th
century
,
English
speakers
used
the
word
"consciousness"
in
the
sense
of
"moral
knowledge
of
right
or
wrong"—a
concept
today
referred
to
as
"conscience"
.

^([3])

Issues
and
methods

[edit]

In
feminism

[edit]

Consciousness
raising
groups
were
formed
by
New
York
Radical
Women
,
an
early
Women
'
s
Liberation
group
in
New
York
City
,
and
quickly
spread
throughout
the
United
States
.


In
November
1967
,
a
group
including
Shulamith
Firestone
,
Anne
Koedt
,
Kathie
Sarachild
(originally
Kathie
Amatniek)
,
and
Carol
Hanisch
began
meeting
in
Koedt
'
s
apartment
.


Meetings
often
involved
"going
around
the
room
and
talking"
about
issues
in
their
own
lives
.


The
phrase
"consciousness
raising"
was
coined
to
describe
the
process
when
Kathie
Sarachild
took
up
the
phrase
from
Anne
Forer
:


In
the
Old
Left
,
they
used
to
say
that
the
workers
don
'
t
know
they
'
re

oppressed
,
so
we
have
to
raise
their
consciousness
.


One
night
at
a

meeting
I
said
,

'
Would
everybody
please
give
me
an
example
from
their

own
life
on
how
they
experienced
oppression
as
a
woman
?


I
need
to
hear

it
to
raise
my
own
consciousness
.


'

Kathie
was
sitting
behind
me
and

the
words
rang
in
her
mind
.


From
then
on
she
sort
of
made
it
an

institution
and
called
it
consciousness-raising
.




—
Anne
Forer^([4])

On
Thanksgiving
1968
,
Kathie
Sarachild
presented
A
Program
for
Feminist
Consciousness
Raising
,
at
the
First
National
Women
'
s
Liberation
Conference
near
Chicago
,
Illinois
,
in
which
she
explained
the
principles
behind
consciousness-raising
and
outlined
a
program
for
the
process
that
the
New
York
groups
had
developed
over
the
past
year
.


Groups
founded
by
former
members
of
New
York
Radical
Women—in
particular
Redstockings
,
founded
out
of
the
breakup
of
the
NYRW
in
1969
,
and
New
York
Radical
Feminists—promoted
consciousness
raising
and
distributed
mimeographed
sheets
of
suggesting
topics
for
consciousness
raising
group
meetings
.


New
York
Radical
Feminists
organized
neighborhood-based
c
.

r
.


groups
in
Manhattan
,
Brooklyn
,
and
Queens
,
involving
as
many
as
four
hundred
women
in
c
.

r
.


groups
at
its
peak
.

^([5])
Over
the
next
few
years
,
small-group
consciousness
raising
spread
rapidly
in
cities
and
suburbs
throughout
the
United
States
.


By
1971
,
the
Chicago
Women
'
s
Liberation
Union
,
which
had
already
organized
several
consciousness
raising
groups
in
Chicago
,
described
small
consciousness
raising
groups
as
"the
backbone
of
the
Women
'
s
Liberation
Movement"
.

^([6])
Susan
Brownmiller
,
a
member
of
the
West
Village^([a])
would
later
write
that
small-group
consciousness
raising
"was
the
movement
'
s
most
successful
form
of
female
bonding
,
and
the
source
of
most
of
its
creative
thinking
.


Some
of
the
small
groups
stayed
together
for
more
than
a
decade"
.

^([7])

"In
1973
,
probably
the
height
of
CR
,
100
,000
women
in
the
United
States
belonged
to
CR
groups
.

"^([8])

Early
mid-century
feminists
argued
that
women
were
isolated
from
each
other
,
and
as
a
result
many
problems
in
women
'
s
lives
were
misunderstood
as
"personal
,"
or
as
the
results
of
conflicts
between
the
personalities
of
individual
men
and
women
,
rather
than
systematic
forms
of
oppression
.


Raising
consciousness
meant
helping
oneself
and
helping
others
to
become
politically
conscious
.


Consciousness
raising
groups
aimed
to
get
a
better
understanding
of
women
'
s
oppression
by
bringing
women
together
to
discuss
and
analyze
their
lives
,
without
interference
from
the
presence
of
men
.

^([9])

While
explaining
the
theory
behind
consciousness
raising
in
a
1973
talk
,
Kathie
Sarachild
remarked
that
"From
the
beginning
of
consciousness-raising 
.


.


.


there
has
been
no
one
method
of
raising
consciousness
.


What
really
counts
in
consciousness-raising
are
not
methods
,
but
results
.


The
only

'
methods
'

of
consciousness
raising
are
essentially
principles
.


They
are
the
basic
radical
political
principles
of
going
to
the
original
sources
,
both
historic
and
personal
,
going
to
people—women
themselves
,
and
going
to
experience
for
theory
and
strategy"
.

^([10])
However
,
most
consciousness
raising
groups
did
follow
a
similar
pattern
for
meeting
and
discussion
.


Meetings
would
usually
be
held
about
once
a
week
,
with
a
small
group
of
women
,
often
in
the
living
room
of
one
of
the
members
.


Meetings
were
women-only
,
and
usually
involved
going
around
the
room
for
each
woman
to
talk
about
a
predetermined
subject—for
example
,
"When
you
think
about
having
a
child
,
would
you
rather
have
a
boy
or
a
girl
?

"^([citation
needed])—speaking
from
her
own
experience
,
with
no
formal
leader
for
the
discussion
and
few
rules
for
directing
or
limiting
discussion
.


(Some
c
.

r
.


groups
did
implement
rules
designed
to
give
every
woman
a
chance
to
speak
,
to
prevent
interruptions
,
etc
.

)
Speaking
from
personal
experience
was
used
as
a
basis
for
further
discussion
and
analysis
based
on
the
first-hand
knowledge
that
was
shared
.

^([citation
needed])

Some
feminist
advocates
of
consciousness
raising
argued
that
the
process
allowed
women
to
analyze
the
conditions
of
their
own
lives
,
and
to
discover
ways
in
which
what
had
seemed
like
isolated
,
individual
problems
(such
as
needing
an
abortion
,
surviving
rape
,
conflicts
between
husbands
and
wives
over
housework
,
etc
.

)
actually
reflected
common
conditions
faced
by
all
women
.

^([citation
needed])
As
Sarachild
wrote
in
1969
,
"We
assume
that
our
feelings
are
telling
us
something
from
which
we
can
learn
.


.


.


that
our
feelings
mean
something
worth
analyzing
.


.


.


that
our
feelings
are
saying
something
political
,
something
reflecting
fear
that
something
bad
will
happen
to
us
or
hope
,
desire
,
knowledge
that
something
good
will
happen
to
us
.


.


.


.


In
our
groups
,
let
'
s
share
our
feelings
and
pool
them
.


Let
'
s
let
ourselves
go
and
see
where
our
feelings
lead
us
.


Our
feelings
will
lead
us
to
ideas
and
then
to
actions"
.

^([11])

Ellen
Willis
wrote
in
1984
that
consciousness
raising
has
often
been
"misunderstood
and
disparaged
as
a
form
of
therapy"
,
but
that
it
was
,
in
fact
,
in
its
time
and
context
,
"the
primary
method
of
understanding
women
'
s
condition"
and
constituted
"the
movement
'
s
most
successful
organizing
tool
.

"
At
the
same
time
,
she
saw
the
lack
of
theory
and
emphasis
on
personal
experience
as
concealing
"prior
political
and
philosophical
assumptions"
.

^([12])

However
,
some
in
the
feminist
movement
criticised
consciousness
raising
groups
as
"trivial"
and
apolitical
.

^([13])

Through
poetry

[edit]

Historically
,
poetry
has
been
used
as
a
consciousness-raising
tactic
by
consciousness-raising
groups
.

^([14])
Activist
and
writer
Audre
Lorde
was
noted
to
have
been
one
of
many
scholars
who
wrote
of
poetry
as
a
means
of
communication
for
women
of
color
activist
and
resistance
groups
.

^([15])
This
focus
has
also
been
studied
by
other
feminist
scholars
as
a
new
approach
to
women
'
s
literary
writing
experience
,^([16])
and
the
usage
of
critical
consciousness
through
the
creation
of
art
as
a
liberatory
praxis
.

^([17])
Art
as
a
liberatory
praxis
has
also
been
explored
through
a
radical
queer
lens
through
a
number
of
publications
and
journals
such
as
Sinister
Wisdom^([18])
and
Conditions
,^([19])
online
publications
with
an
emphasis
on
lesbian
writing
.



For
LGBT
rights

[edit]

In
the
1960s
,
consciousness-raising
caught
on
with
gay
liberation
activists
,^([20])
who
formed
the
first
"coming-out
groups"
which
helped
participants
come
out
of
the
closet
among
welcoming
,
tolerant
individuals
and
share
personal
stories
about
coming
out
.


The
idea
of
coming
out
as
a
tool
of
consciousness-raising
had
been
preceded
by
even
earlier
opinions
from
German
theorists
such
as
Magnus
Hirschfeld
,
Iwan
Bloch
and
Karl
Heinrich
Ulrichs
,
all
of
whom
saw
self-disclosure
as
a
means
of
self-emancipation
,
the
raising
of
consciousness
among
fellow
un-closeted
individuals
and
a
means
of
raising
awareness
in
the
wider
society
.

^([citation
needed])

In
atheism

[edit]

In
The
God
Delusion
,
anti-religion
activist
Richard
Dawkins
uses
the
term
"consciousness
raising"
for
several
other
things
,
explicitly
describing
these
as
analogous
to
the
feminist
case
.

^([21])
These
include
replacing
references
to
children
as
Catholic
,
Muslim
,
etc
.


with
references
to
children
of
the
adults
who
are
members
of
these
religions
(which
he
compares
to
our
using
non-sexist
terminology)
and
Darwin
as
"raising
our
consciousness"
in
biology
to
the
possibility
of
explaining
complexity
naturalistically
and
,
in
principle
,
raising
our
consciousness
to
the
possibility
of
doing
such
things
elsewhere
(especially
in
physics)
.

^([21])
Earlier
in
the
book
,
he
uses
the
term
(without
explicitly
referring
to
feminism)
to
refer
to
making
people
aware
that
leaving
their
parents
'

faith
is
an
option
.

“The
word

consciousness
derives
from
the
Latin
conscientia
,
composed
of
cum

(with
or
together)
and
scire
(to
know)
.


Until
the
early
17th

century
,
consciousness
was
used
in
the
sense
of
moral
knowledge
of

right
or
wrong
,
what
is
today
referred
to
as
conscience
.

Consciousness
is
the
individual
awareness
of
your
unique
thoughts
,
memories
,
feelings
,
sensations
,
and
environments
.


Essentially
,
your
consciousness
is
your
awareness
of
yourself
and
the
world
around
you
.



This
awareness
is
subjective
and
unique
to
you
.


If
you
can
describe
something
you
are
experiencing
in
words
,
then
it
is
part
of
your
consciousness
.



Your
conscious
experiences
are
constantly
shifting
and
changing
.


For
example
,
in
one
moment
,
you
may
be
focused
on
reading
this
article
.


Your
consciousness
may
then
shift
to
the
memory
of
a
conversation
you
had
earlier
with
a
co-worker
.


Next
,
you
might
notice
how
uncomfortable
your
chair
is
,
or
maybe
you
are
mentally
planning
dinner
.



This
ever-shifting
stream
of
thoughts
can
change
dramatically
from
one
moment
to
the
next
,
but
your
experience
of
it
seems
smooth
and
effortless
.




States
of
Consciousness


The
various
states
of
consciousness
include
:

-
Dreams
-
Hallucinations
-
Hypnosis
-
Meditation
-
Sleep
-
States
induced
by
psychoactive
drugs

The
two
normal
states
of
awareness
are
consciousness
and
unconsciousness
.


Higher
states
of
consciousness
are
often
associated
with
spiritual
or
mystical
experiences
.


It
involves
an
elevated
state
of
awareness
where
people
are
able
to
gain
a
greater
sense
of
themselves
,
their
role
,
and
the
world
.


Examples
of
this
include
transcendence
,
meditation
,
mindfulness
,
a
"runner
'
s
high
,"
lucid
dreaming
,
and
flow
states
.

 

Altered
levels
of
consciousness
also
can
occur
,
which
may
be
caused
by
medical
or
mental
conditions
that
impair
or
change
awareness
.

 
Altered
types
of
consciousness
include
:

-
Coma
-
Confusion
-
Delirium
-
Disorientation
-
Lethargy
-
Stupor

Doctors
and
healthcare
professionals
use
various
assessments
to
measure
and
assess
levels
of
consciousness
.


They
use
scores
on
these
assessments
to
guide
diagnosis
and
treatment
decisions
.



What
Are
the
5
Levels
of
Consciousness
?



Conscious
:
Everything
you
are
aware
of

Preconscious
:
Information
you
are
not
currently
aware
of
that
you
can
pull
into
awareness
if
needed

Unconscious
:
Memories
that
are
outside
of
awareness
and
inaccessible

Non-conscious
:
Automatically
bodily
functions
that
occur
without
awareness
and
sensation

Subconscious
:
Information
that
is
out
of
consciousness
and
not
immediately
available
to
consciousness

What
Is
the
Unconscious
Mind
?




Functions
of
Consciousness


Consciousness
has
several
biological
and
social
purposes
.


For
example
,
it
allows
us
to
process
information
,
choose
our
actions
,
set
priorities
,
learn
and
adapt
to
new
information
,
make
decisions
,
and
more
.



Consciousness
is
an
essential
state
in
philosophy
,
spirituality
,
and
religion
.


All
of
these
require
self-awareness
,
which
is
impossible
without
consciousness
.




Changes
in
Consciousness


Understanding
different
levels
of
consciousness
can
help
healthcare
professionals
spot
signs
that
someone
might
be
experiencing
a
problem
.


Some
of
these
changes
occur
naturally
;
others
are
the
result
of
factors
such
as
drugs
or
brain
damage
.


Changes
to
consciousness
also
can
cause
changes
to
perception
,
thinking
,
understanding
,
and
interpretations
of
the
world
.



Changes
in
consciousness
can
sometimes
be
a
sign
of
medical
conditions
or
they
may
even
be
a
sign
of
an
immediate
medical
emergency
.



For
example
,
sudden
changes
in
consciousness
might
be
a
sign
of
:

-
Aneurysm
-
Brain
infections
-
Brain
tumor
or
injury
-
Dementia
or
Alzheimer
'
s
disease
-
Drug
use
-
Epilepsy
-
Heart
disease
-
Heatstroke
-
Lack
of
oxygen
to
the
brain
-
Low
blood
sugar
-
Poisoning
-
Shock
-
Stroke

When
to
Seek
Help

If
you
thinking
you
are
experiencing
changes
in
consciousness
,
talk
to
your
doctor
.


Sudden
changes
may
be
a
sign
of
a
medical
emergency
that
requires
immediate
attention
,
such
as
a
stroke
or
hemorrhage
.

 

Talking
to
your
doctor
right
away
can
ensure
that
you
get
immediate
treatment
before
problems
get
worse
.




History
of
Consciousness


For
thousands
of
years
,
the
study
of
human
consciousness
was
largely
the
work
of
philosophers
.


The
French
philosopher
Rene
Descartes
introduced
the
concept
of
mind-body
dualism
or
the
idea
that
while
the
mind
and
body
are
separate
,
they
do
interact
.



Once
psychology
was
established
as
a
discipline
separate
from
philosophy
and
biology
,
the
study
of
the
conscious
experience
became
one
of
the
first
topics
studied
by
early
psychologists
.



Structuralists
used
a
process
known
as
introspection
to
analyze
and
report
conscious
sensations
,
thoughts
,
and
experiences
.


Trained
observers
would
carefully
inspect
the
contents
of
their
own
minds
.


Obviously
,
this
was
a
very
subjective
process
,
but
it
helped
inspire
further
research
on
the
scientific
study
of
consciousness
.



The
American
psychologist
William
James
compared
consciousness
to
a
stream—unbroken
and
continuous
despite
constant
shifts
and
changes
.


Psychoanalyst
Sigmund
Freud
focused
on
understanding
the
importance
of
the
unconscious
and
conscious
mind
.



While
the
focus
of
much
of
the
research
in
psychology
shifted
to
purely
observable
behaviors
during
the
first
half
of
the
20th
century
,
research
on
human
consciousness
has
grown
tremendously
since
the
1950s
.




Theories
of
Consciousness


One
of
the
problems
with
the
study
of
consciousness
is
the
lack
of
a
universally
accepted
operational
definition
.


Descartes
proposed
the
idea
of
cogito
ergo
sum
("I
think
,
therefore
I
am")
,
which
suggested
that
the
very
act
of
thinking
demonstrates
the
reality
of
one’s
existence
and
consciousness
.



Today
,
consciousness
is
generally
defined
as
an
awareness
of
yourself
and
the
world
.


However
,
there
are
still
debates
about
the
different
aspects
of
this
awareness
.



Research
on
consciousness
has
focused
on
understanding
the
neuroscience
behind
our
conscious
experiences
.


Scientists
have
even
utilized
brain-scanning
technology
to
seek
out
specific
neurons
that
might
be
linked
to
different
conscious
events
.


Modern
researchers
have
proposed
two
major
theories
of
consciousness
:
integrated
information
theory
and
global
workspace
theory
.




Integrated
Information
Theory


This
approach
looks
at
consciousness
by
learning
more
about
the
physical
processes
that
underlie
our
conscious
experiences
.


The
theory
attempts
to
create
a
measure
of
the
integrated
information
that
forms
consciousness
.


The
quality
of
an
organism’s
consciousness
is
represented
by
the
level
of
integration
.



This
theory
tends
to
focus
on
whether
something
is
conscious
and
to
what
degree
it
is
conscious
.




Global
Workspace
Theory


This
theory
suggests
that
we
have
a
memory
bank
from
which
the
brain
draws
information
to
form
the
experience
of
conscious
awareness
.

﻿﻿
While
integrated
information
theory
focuses
more
on
identifying
whether
an
organism
is
conscious
,
the
global
workspace
theory
offers
a
much
broader
approach
to
understanding
how
consciousness
works
.



The
Different
States
of
Consciousness


Summary


While
consciousness
has
intrigued
philosophers
and
scientists
for
thousands
of
years
,
experts
clearly
have
a
long
way
to
go
in
our
understanding
of
the
concept
.


Researchers
continue
to
explore
the
different
bases
of
consciousness
including
the
physical
,
social
,
cultural
,
and
psychological
influences
that
contribute
to
our
conscious
awareness
.

[Waking
class
consciousness
today]

 

How
woke
is
the
U
.

S
.


working
class
?


The
good
news
:
A
recent
study
suggests
that
millennials
are
more
likely
than
previous
generations
to
self-identify
as
working
class
.


The
bad
news
:
In
the
2016
presidential
election
,
41%
of
voters
with
a
family
income
under
$50
,000
voted
for
Trump
.



The
working
class
can’t
be
blamed
for
Trump’s
victory
.


But
more
than
4
in
10
voters
with
a
family
income
under
$50
,000
voted
for
a
man
who
promised
to
repeal
the
Affordable
Care
Act
.


This
fact
alone
shows
that
the
working
class
is
not
woke
enough
.


Raising
class
consciousness
should
be
a
top
priority
for
left
activists
,
and
we
need
more
ways
to
do
it
.



First
,
let’s
examine
the
terminology
.


What’s
“working
class”
?


To
most
people
in
the
U
.

S
.


,
the
term
indicates
an
income
bracket
:
currently
,
families
making
less
than
$38
,000
.



To
some
,
it’s
a
cultural
marker
that
refers
only
to
people
with
blue
collar
jobs
.


To
others
,
including
many
millennials
,
the
phrase
means
failure
:
the
failure
to
make
it
into
the
middle
class
.


It
is
a
negative
identification
,
one
that
says
,
“I
thought
I’d
be
better
off
by
now
.

”

All
three
of
these
misunderstandings
work
against
wokeness
.




Class
is
wholly
determined
by
one’s
structural
position
within
a
given
economic
system

For
Marxists
,
class
is
not
defined
by
income
,
type
of
job
,
or
degree
of
success
.


Class
is
wholly
determined
by
one’s
structural
position
within
a
given
economic
system
;
specifically
,
one’s
relation
to
the
means
of
production
.


If
you
do
not
own
the
means
of
production—if
you
depend
on
wages
or
a
salary—you
belong
to
the
working
class
.


If
you
do
own
the
means
of
production
,
you
belong
to
the
capitalist
class
.


Income
and
wealth
are
not
decisive
factors
.


The
dividing
line
between
workers
and
capitalists
is
drawn
on
the
basis
of
shared
economic
interests
.


It’s
in
the
interests
of
the
capitalists
to
make
and
keep
as
much
property
,
profit
and
power
as
possible
.


It’s
in
the
interests
of
the
workers
for
all
power
and
resources
to
be
shared
.



But
many
working-class
people
have
been
taught
to
misunderstand
their
real
economic
interests
.


On
the
basis
of
this
misunderstanding
,
they
mistake
the
capitalists
for
their
allies
,
and
vote
against
themselves
.



One
of
our
best
weapons
in
fighting
such
misunderstandings
is
our
ability
to
analyze
ideology
.


In
a
major
contribution
to
Western
thought
,
Marx
revealed
that
prevailing
beliefs
and
values
,
which
we
mistake
for
timeless
truths
,
are
actually
“ideology
.

”
That
is
,
they
are
historically
specific
products
that
support
the
status
quo
.


A
precept
as
simple
and
seemingly
obvious
as
“thou
shalt
not
steal”
supports
certain
assumptions
about
property
rights
and
ownership
,
the
status
of
things
under
capitalism
.


One
can
imagine
a
different
society
whose
precept
would
be
,
“thou
shalt
share
.

”
We
don’t
live
in
that
one
.



[]

Marx
,
and
the
20th-century
Marxist
philosopher
Louis
Althusser
,
emphasized
that
ideology
is
not
the
intentional
product
of
a
few
conspirators
.


The
system
of
beliefs
and
behaviors
encompassed
by
the
term
“ideology”
is
much
too
large
and
complex
to
be
produced
and
controlled
by
any
group
of
individuals
.


Rather
,
ideology
is
like
an
ecosystem
in
which
we
all
live
.


It
works
to
blind
everyone
to
the
social
inequalities
and
class
politics
that
underlie
our
successes
,
failures
,
privileges
,
and
limitations
.


The
capitalists
are
fooled
into
believing
that
the
wealth
and
power
they’ve
acquired
is
rightfully
theirs
.


So
are
the
workers
.



In
a
brilliant
essay
on
ideologyAlthusser
points
out
that
in
every
generation
,
the
conditions
of
production
must
be
reproduced
.


Worn
out
tools
and
machinery
must
be
replaced
,
software
upgraded
and
so
on
,
but
also
the
workforce
must
be
replaced
.


Workers
must
be
taught
techniques
and
skills
,
but
more
importantly
,
they
must
be
taught
“respect
for
rules
of
the
order
established
by
class
domination
.

” 
For
example
,
each
child
must
learn
that
the
United
States
has
the
best
economic
system
ever
;
if
people
are
poor
it’s
their
own
fault
,
and
anyway
the
system
is
impossible
to
change
.


Such
beliefs
keep
people
docilely
joining
the
status
quo
.




We
learn
and
re-learn
the
rules
through
many
channels

It’s
not
just
schools
that
teach
such
ideological
rules
and
reward
us
for
accepting
them
.


We
learn
and
re-learn
the
rules
through
many
channels
,
including
mass
media
,
culture
(literature
,
the
arts
,
sports)
,
the
family
,
social
groups
,
religious
institutions
.


Althusser
calls
these
“Ideological
State
Apparatuses”
(ISAs)
.


They
are
supposed
to
work
together
to
perpetuate
beliefs
and
behaviors
that
reproduce
existing
distribution
of
wealth
and
power
.


But
they
do
so
very
quietly
and
subtly
.


The
system
works
best
if
we
believe
we
are
freely
choosing
,
making
up
our
own
minds
,
not
being
forced
into
something
.



Ironically
,
the
people
who
truly
believe
that
America
is
the
land
of
freedom
and
free
choice
have
been
the
most
effectively
subjected
to
ISAs
.


Their
minds
have
been
molded
to
regard
this
idea
as
a
simple
truth
,
even
though
their
own
firsthand
experience
contradicts
it
.


Such
examples
hint
at
the
power
of
ideology
.



Althusser
differentiates
ISAs
,
which
operate
subtly
,
from
a
different
type
of
power
,
the
“Repressive
State
Apparatus
.

”
Repressive
power
consists
of
government
,
police
,
army
,
courts
,
and
prisons
;
it
functions
by
violence
and
forcible
,
visible
repression
or
coercion
.


It
is
completely
controlled
by
the
ruling
class
,
except
in
a
time
of
revolution
,
and
functions
as
backup
when
ISAs
fail
.


For
example
,
schools
teach
students
that
our
criminal
justice
system
is
fair
and
unbiased
.


But
if
the
students
do
not
learn
right
and
take
to
the
streets
to
protest
dramatic
racial
injustice
,
they
can
be
arrested
by
the
police
and
sent
to
jail
.



Yet
the
fact
that
such
things
do
happen
demonstrates
that
the
ISAs
are
fallible
.


They
never
work
perfectly
to
support
the
capitalist
status
quo
.


Some
people
are
woke
,
able
to
think
critically
about
the
messages
the
ISAs
are
sending
and
offer
opposing
views
.


They
keep
the
ISAs
from
forming
one
big
happy
brainwasher
,
and
make
them
into
a
complicated
,
ever-shifting
set
of
battlefields
.



The
ISAs
,
then
,
are
not
something
we
fight
against
,
but
something
we
fight
within
.


They
are
sites
of
struggle
because
,
as
Althusser
puts
it
,
“former
ruling
classes
are
able
to
retain
strong
positions
there
for
a
long
time
,
but
also
because
the
resistance
of
the
exploited
classes
is
able
to
find
means
and
occasions
to
express
itself
there
,
either
by
the
utilization
of
their
contradictions
,
or
by
conquering
combat
positions
in
them
in
struggle
.

Consider
the
example
of
music
.


If
you
press
“scan”
on
your
car
radio
,
you
might
hear
a
Beethoven
symphony
that
was
once
used
to
distinguish
the
educated
aristocracy
from
the
upstart
bourgeoise
factory
owner
.


Then
comes
a
Top
40
station
with
its
love
songs
and
laments
,
all
stressing
that
one
should
focus
on
private
life
and
forget
about
politics
.


Another
station
plays
Springsteen
,
Bob
Dylan
,
and
Aretha
Franklin
,
past
anthems
of
social
protest
now
coated
in
nostalgia
,
though
they
still
bear
witness
to
the
anger
that
bore
them
.


Then
you
might
hit
a
college
station
playing
new
protest
music
:
Mona
Haydar
,
Chicano
Batman
,
M
.

I
.

A
.


As
Althusser
put
it
,
the
ISAs
are
“not
only
the
stake
but
also
the
site
of
class
struggle
.

”

Over
the
past
decade
,
progressive
forces
have
made
great
use
of
television
,
presenting
strong
positive
images
of
women
,
people
of
color
,
differently
abled
,
gay
,
lesbian
,
or
trans
.


These
fictional
characters
have
had
a
huge
impact
,
helping
drive
some
conservative
ideological
forces
into
retreat
.


Though
difficult
to
prove
,
it
seems
very
likely
that
the
shows
have
helped
bring
about
material
change
,
such
as
the
legalization
of
gay
marriage
.


Unfortunately
,
class
struggle
has
been
less
widely
portrayed
on
TV
.


As
access
to
production
and
distribution
mechanisms
opens
up
,
activists
should
seize
opportunities
to
create
representations
that
further
class
consciousness
.


We
can
also
draw
attention
to
images
that
do
exist
and
help
people
interpret
their
meaning
.




Not
all
revolutionary
battles
happen
in
the
realm
of
ideology

Granted
,
not
all
revolutionary
battles
happen
in
the
realm
of
ideology
.


Material
struggles
over
economic
structures
and
political
power
are
ultimately
more
important
.


But
raising
class
consciousness
means
finding
allies
so
that
material
struggles
can
be
waged
and
won
.


We
need
to
identify
spaces
within
ideology
where
working-class
identity
is
being
contested
,
and
devise
interventions
.


Ideological
struggles
are
dynamic
and
fluid
.


Images
that
were
derogatory
can
be
appropriated
as
symbols
of
power
,
or
vice
versa
.


An
important
site
of
struggle
may
suddenly
become
irrelevant
.


Therefore
,
ideological
analysis
always
has
to
be
done
anew
,
for
the
here
and
now
.



Right
now
,
a
very
dangerous
ideological
battle
is
being
fought
over
what
it
means
to
be
a
white
working-class
man
.


Trump
and
his
allies
have
shaped
an
enticing
fantasy
for
this
particular
population
,
promising
to
restore
their
lost
economic
and
social
power
by
taking
back
the
rights
of
Others
(women
,
ethnic
and
religious
minorities
,
immigrants
,
the
LGBTQ
community)
.


Of
course
,
working-class
men
never
had
economic
or
social
power
.


That
doesn’t
stop
the
enemy
from
representing
it
as
lost
,
stolen
.


In
this
fight
,
the
far
right
portrays
race
,
religion
,
gender
,
and
sexuality
as
decisive
dividing
lines
,
blocking
any
perception
of
shared
interests
based
on
class
.



The
left
has
relied
heavily
on
critique
to
fight
back
.


Critique
is
important
:
we
must
expose
lies
and
reveal
contradictions
.


But
it
isn’t
enough
.


Now
more
than
ever
,
the
working
class
needs
positive
ideals
,
competing
representations
that
position
working-class
identity
as
attractive
and
embraceable
.


Communists
and
socialists
actually
have
positive
ideals
to
offer
,
a
great
advantage
over
our
liberal
allies
.


We
need
to
use
this
advantage
to
maximum
effect
.


Fight
back
by
presenting
images
and
stories
of
alliances
based
on
class
.


Look
for
opportunities
to
redirect
ideological
assertions
.


Their
rhetoric
promotes
the
belief
that
white
men
have
been
robbed
of
power
and
relevance
.


Our
rhetoric
promotes
belief
in
an
inclusive
future
that
will
be
more
rewarding
for
everyone
.


They
tell
a
story
of
lost
power
and
create
opportunities
for
the
violent
expression
of
rage
and
hatred
.


We
tell
a
story
of
exciting
discovery
,
and
create
opportunities
to
learn
from
and
respect
each
other
.



[]

One
way
of
creating
such
opportunities
was
developed
by
the
women’s
movement
in
the
1970s
.


At
that
time
,
it
was
common
for
women
not
to
feel
solidarity
with
other
women
,
and
not
to
accept
that
sexism
was
real
.


Feminists
brought
women
together
in
“consciousness
raising”
groups
to
share
their
experiences
.


“I
have
never
been
subjected
to
sexism
,”
a
woman
might
say
.


“I
do
have
varicose
veins
from
wearing
high
heels
,
a
husband
who
does
no
housework
and
ridicules
the
books
I
like
,
and
a
minimum
wage
job
at
a
day
care
.


But
those
things
are
just
my
own
individual
life
choices
.

”
As
women
listened
to
other
women
,
they
began
to
see
their
common
experiences
as
products
of
an
oppressive
system
.


At
the
same
time
,
fellowship
and
camaraderie
with
other
women
made
the
identification
rewarding
:
“Sisterhood
is
a
warm
feeling
!

”
This
affirmation
re-defined
what
it
meant
to
be
a
woman
,
changing
the
affective
value
of
the
identification
from
something
demeaning
to
something
positive
and
celebrated
.




Strong
working-class
identification
provides
the
unifying
factor
that
makes
other
aspects
of
identity
a
matter
of
diversity

The
same
method
might
work
to
raise
class
consciousness
.


In
a
diverse
group
,
facilitators
could
ask
whether
participants
have
ever
been
injured
at
work
,
whether
they
are
able
to
save
money
,
take
time
off
for
family
,
own
a
house
or
pay
for
college
without
debt
,
and
also
whether
their
bosses
can
do
these
things
;
what
percentage
of
revenue
the
company
would
lose
without
the
worker
,
and
how
this
compares
to
the
worker’s
wages
;
whether
the
boss
deserves
to
have
more
money
and
power
,
etc
.


Questions
that
might
seem
demeaning
in
an
individual
conversation
have
a
different
effect
in
a
cohort
group
,
where
the
pleasures
of
solidarity
can
make
working-class
identification
rewarding
.


The
answers
people
say
and
hear
will
validate
firsthand
experience
,
allowing
the
representation
of
firsthand
experience
to
gain
power
over
false
ideological
precepts
.


(“Wait
a
minute
!


That’s
not
right
.


That’s
not
fair
.

”)

Such
groups
can
lead
participants
to
see
class
similarities
across
racial
and
ethnic
divides
.


This
requires
an
upstream
paddle
against
the
many
enticements
of
ideological
forces
urging
us
to
understand
ourselves
in
other
ways
,
ways
that
divide
the
working
class
but
may
be
more
attached
to
privilege
or
at
least
to
pride
,
community
and
belonging
.


But
again
,
the
widespread
failure
of
people
to
identify
themselves
in
a
primary
sense
as
workers
,
having
interests
in
common
with
all
other
workers
,
is
a
major
obstacle
to
progress
.


Class
identification
does
not
preclude
others
(ethnicity
,
gender
,
sexual
orientation
,
age
,
profession
,
etc
.

)
.


But
a
strong
working-class
identification
provides
the
unifying
factor
that
makes
other
aspects
of
identity
a
matter
of
diversity
rather
than
division
.



In
the
past
,
Marxists
embraced
a
simpler
opposition
between
capitalist
ideology
and
workers’
material
reality
,
or
truth
.


Ideology
was
the
enemy
and
truth
was
the
weapon
.


But
life
in
the
21st
century
is
fully
soaked
in
representations
,
and
representations
are
always
ideological
.


It
is
no
longer
possible
,
if
it
ever
was
,
to
separate
reality
from
ideology
.


We
can’t
simply
pop
ourselves
out
of
the
tight
network
of
images
and
practices
,
hopes
and
fears
that
keep
people
believing
,
for
example
,
that
we
all
have
an
equal
shot
at
the
top
.


To
contest
this
imaginary
relationship
to
an
exploitative
reality
,
we
have
to
work
within
the
network
,
using
the
tools
it
provides
.


Class
struggle
against
pro-capitalist
ideological
forces
must
take
place
within
ideology
.


In
addition
to
critique
,
we
need
positive
representations
of
working-class
identity
to
raise
class
consciousness
and
compete
with
the
far
right
.

Moral
Conscience

From
the
Catechism
of
the
Catholic
Church
,
Simplified

«

An
Inner
Law
(1776)

Deep
within
his
conscience
,
man
discovers
a
law
which
he
must
obey
,
namely
to
do
good
and
to
avoid
evil
.


In
his
conscience
(man
'
s
most
secret
core)
he
is
alone
with
God
whose
voice
echoes
within
man
.



Conscience
-
Judge
of
Individual
Acts
(1777-1779)

Moral
conscience
urges
a
person
to
do
good
and
avoid
evil
.


It
even
judges
his
particular
choices
(past
,
present
,
and
future)
and
shows
God
'
s
authority
.


The
prudent
man
hears
God
speaking
in
his
commandments
.



By
conscience
,
the
person
'
s
reason
judges
the
morality
of
his
actions
(past
,
present
,
or
future)
.


In
this
judgment
,
man
sees
God
'
s
law
.


"Conscience
is
a
messenger
of
him
who
speaks
to
us
behind
a
veil
and
teaches
us
by
his
representatives
.


Conscience
is
the
aboriginal
Vicar
of
Christ"
(John
Cardinal
Newman)
.



Every
person
must
have
sufficient
interior
awareness
so
he
can
hear
and
follow
his
conscience
.


"Turn
inward
,
brethren
,
and
in
everything
you
do
,
see
God
as
your
witness"
(St
.


Augustine)
.



An
Upright
Conscience
Assumes
Responsibility
(1780-1782)

Human
dignity
requires
an
upright
conscience
which
knows
moral
principles
and
applies
them
in
each
circumstance
.


Truth
is
recognized
by
prudent
judgments
.


Whoever
follows
his
conscience
is
indeed
prudent
.



By
conscience
,
a
person
assumes
responsibility
.


Even
in
evil
deeds
,
conscience
remains
an
inner
witness
to
truth
that
the
choice
was
evil
.


This
true
judgment
makes
clear
that
the
person
must
seek
forgiveness
and
choose
good
in
the
future
.


"Whenever
our
hearts
condemn
us
,
we
reassure
ourselves
that
God
is
greater
than
our
hearts
and
he
knows
everything"
(1
Jn
3
:19-20)
.



Man
has
a
right
to
make
his
own
moral
decisions
.


He
cannot
be
forced
to
act
contrary
to
his
conscience
,
nor
be
prevented
from
acting
according
to
his
conscience
,
especially
in
religious
matters
.



Man
'
s
Duty
-
To
Have
a
Right
Conscience
(1783-1785)

The
person
has
a
duty
to
have
a
true
conscience
which
is
formed
by
reason
and
seeks
to
know
God
'
s
will
.


Only
the
educating
of
conscience
can
overcome
negative
influences
and
temptations
.



This
lifelong
task
begins
with
awakening
the
child
to
know
and
practice
God
'
s
law
.


A
prudent
education
teaches
virtues
,
cures
selfishness
,
and
guarantees
peace
of
heart
.



The
Word
of
God
guides
this
education
.


Man
must
examine
his
conscience
before
the
cross
,
seek
the
advice
of
others
,
and
learn
the
Church
'
s
authoritative
teaching
.



Difficulties
in
Judging
(1786-1789)

Conscience
can
make
a
right
judgment
(in
accord
with
God
'
s
law
and
reason)
or
an
erroneous
judgment
(not
in
accord)
.



In
some
situations
,
moral
judgments
are
difficult
.


However
,
in
every
case
,
the
person
must
seek
God
'
s
will
in
accord
with
his
law
.



The
person
must
interpret
the
data
,
assisted
by
his
own
prudence
,
competent
advice
,
and
the
help
of
the
Holy
Spirit
.



In
all
cases
,
evil
can
never
be
done
so
good
can
result
.


"Whatever
you
wish
that
men
would
do
to
you
,
do
so
to
them"
(Mt
7
:12)
.


"Do
nothing
that
makes
your
brother
stumble"
(Rom
14
:21)
.



Sources
of
Errors
in
Judgment
(1790-1792)

Although
a
person
must
always
obey
the
certain
judgments
of
his
conscience
,
he
might
be
in
ignorance
and
make
erroneous
judgments
.



Sometimes
,
the
person
is
to
blame
for
having
an
erroneous
conscience
because
he
took
no
effort
to
discover
the
truth
.


In
this
case
,
he
is
responsible
for
the
evil
he
commits
.



There
are
several
sources
of
these
errors
in
judgment
:
ignorance
of
Christ
and
of
his
Gospel
,
bad
example
from
others
,
enslavement
to
passions
,
lack
of
conversion
of
heart
,
and
rejection
of
the
Church
'
s
teaching
.



Unable
to
Overcome
(1793-1794)

Sometimes
,
the
person
is
not
responsible
for
his
erroneous
judgment
because
he
cannot
overcome
the
obstacles
to
truth
.


This
is
called
"invincible
ignorance
.

"
Although
evil
is
present
,
the
person
is
not
blameworthy
.


He
should
work
to
correct
his
errors
.



Conscience
must
be
enlightened
by
faith
so
that
persons
and
groups
will
turn
aside
from
blind
choices
.

How
to
Form
a
Moral
Conscience


-



-



 


What
is
a
Moral
Conscience
?




 
 According
to
the
Catechism
of
the
Catholic
Church
,
a
human

person
“has
in
his
heart
a
law
inscribed
by
God
,”
“calling
him

to
love
.

”
 This
is
a
person’s
moral
conscience
.


(#1776)


 
 In
their
document
Forming
Consciences
for
Faithful

Citizenship
,
the
U
.

S
.


bishops
said
"
Conscience
is
not
something

that
allows
us
to
justify
doing
whatever
we
want
,
nor
is
it
a

mere
‘feeling’
about
what
we
should
or
should
not
do
.


Rather
,

conscience
is
the
voice
of
God
resounding
in
the
human
heart
,

revealing
the
truth
to
us
and
calling
us
to
do
what
is
good

while
shunning
what
is
evil
.

”

 
 The
moral
conscience
urges
a
person “to
do
good
and
avoid

evil
;”
it
also
judges
particular
choices
,
approving
those
which

are
good
and
disapproving
those
which
are
evil
.


(Catechism
of

the
Catholic
Church
,
#1777)
 Our
conscience
enables
us
to

understand
the
principles
of
morality
,
decide
how
to
apply
those

principles
in
specific
circumstances
,
and
judge
the
moral
status

of
concrete
acts
.


(#1780)

 
 The
human
person
"has
the
right
to
act
in
conscience
and
in

freedom"
and
“must
always
obey
the
certain
judgment
of
his

conscience
.

”
(#1782
,
1790)

 
 The
Catechism
says
a
person’s
moral
conscience must
be

informed
and
enlightened
so
that
it
“formulates
its
judgments

according
to
reason
,
[and]
in
conformity
with
the
true
good"

willed
by
God
.


(#1783)
 Shaping
a
well-formed
conscience
is
a

lifelong
task
which
is
rooted
in
the
Word
of
God
,
assisted
by

the
gifts
of
the
Holy
Spirit
,
aided
by
the
witness
or
advice
of

others
,
and
guided
by
the
authoritative
teaching
of
the

Church
.

(#1784-1785)
.



 
 Ignorance
of
Christ
and
his
Gospel
,
bad
example
by
others
,

enslavement
to
one
'
s
passions
,
a
mistaken
notion
of
autonomy
,

rejection
of
the
Church
'
s
authority
or
teaching
,
lack
of

conversion
or
charity
may
all
be
a
source
of
errors
in
moral

judgment
.


 "One
must
therefore
work
to
correct
the
errors
of

moral
conscience
.

"
(1792
,
1793)

 
 The
Catechism
says
that
individuals
are “sometimes
confronted

by
situations
that
make
moral
judgments
less
assured
and

decision
difficult
.

”
 In
such
situations
,
a
person
“must
always

seriously
seek
what
is
right
and
good
and
discern
the
will
of

God
expressed
in
divine
law
.

”(#1787)
 In
this
effort
,
a
person

“strives
to
interpret
the
data
of
experience
and
the
signs
of

the
times”
with
the
assistance
of
“the
virtue
of
prudence
,
…
the

advice
of
competent
people
,
and
…
the
help
of
the
Holy

Spirit…
.

”(#1788)

How
to
Form
a
Moral
Conscience


Here
are
some
guidelines
for
how
to
form
a
moral
conscience
,

particul-arly
in
a
situation
where
you
may
misunderstand
or

disagree
with
a
specific
truth
or
teaching
of
the
Church
:

•
Consult with
a
pastor
,
pastoral
staff
member
or
spiritual

guide
who
understands
and
can
explain
the
Church
'
s
teaching

clearly
and
correctly
.


 Identify
the
fundamental
truths
or

values
on
which
this
teaching
is
based
and
determine
how

essential
this
teaching
is
to
the
core
of
Catholic
faith
.



Beware
of
making
decisions
based
on
information
you
read
in

books
or
online
which
may
not
accurately
explain
the
Church
'
s

teaching
.



•
Assume
that
the
Church
'
s
understanding
of
God
'
s
revelation
and

human
nature
is
fuller
,
deeper
and
more
reliable
than
any

individual
'
s
.



Even
though
the
Church
'
s
teaching
may
seem
ideal
,
unrealistic
or

wrong
to
you
,
start
from
the
assumption
that
it
is
correct
and

applies
to
your
personal
circumstances
.



  

•
Evaluate
your
personal
opinions
,
feelings
and
circumstances

carefully
.


 Honestly
assess
the
reasons
why
you
are
unable
or

unwilling
to
agree
or
comply
with
the
Church
'
s
teaching
.


 

This
is
best
done
with
the
assistance
of
an
trusted
companion

such
as
a
pastor
,
confessor
or
spiritual
guide
who
understands

the
Church
'
s
teaching
as
well
as
your
personal
circumstances
.



•
Pray
for
the
grace
to
understand
and
appreciate
the
underlying

truth
or
values
which
are
reflected
in
the
Church
'
s
teaching
and

for
the
grace
to
discern
what
is
possible
for
you
in
your

particular
circumstances
.



Be
patient
,
and
allow
time
for
God
'
s
inspiration
to
guide
you

directly
or
through
others
who
know
and
love
you
.



•
Consult
with
your
pastor
,
a
confessor
or
reliable
spiritual

guide
before
making
a
final
decision
.


 The
goal
here
is
to

determine
to
what
extent
you
can
or
cannot
understand
or
follow

the
Church
'
s
teaching
.


 To
what
extent
is
it
possible
to
honor

the
teaching
in
part
?


 To
what
extent
is
it
possible
to
honor

the
underlying
truth
or
value
which
is
reflected
in
the

teaching
?



•
Continue
to
pray
for
the
grace
to
understand
or
comply
with

the
Church
'
s
teaching
more
fully
,
in
spite
of
your
personal

circumstances
.


 Pray
for
the
grace
to
appreciate
and
honor
the

underlying
truth
or
value
reflected
in
a
particular
teaching
.



Be
open
to
changing
your
decision
as
your
understanding
or

circumstances
change
.



•
Consult
with
your
pastor
,
a
confessor
or
reliable
spiritual

guide
if
you
are
troubled
by
your
decision
.



•
Remember
that
God
knows
you
are
an
imperfect
and
sinful
person

and
loves
you
nonetheless
.


 

Trust
in
God
'
s
mercy
and
love
even
if
,
after
careful

discernment
,
your
decision
does
not
agree
with
the
Church
'
s

teaching
.



If
we
decide
that
we
cannot
understand
or
comply completely
with

the
Church
'
s
teaching
,
we
should
avoid
coming
to
the
conclusion

that
the
Church
must
be
wrong
.


 Although
at
times
prophetic

individuals
and
groups
within
the
Church
come
to
different

conclusions
which
the
Church
officially
accepts
at
a
later
date
,

most
of
us
are
not
prophets
.



If
we
are
led
by
a
morally
responsible
conscience
to
believe
or

act
in
a
way
which
is
contrary
to
what
the
Church
teaches
at
the

present
time
,
we
should
continue
to
assume
that
the
Church
is

correct
and
that
for
more
or
less
legitimate
reasons
I
am
unable

or
unwilling
to
agree
or
comply
.


 We
should
continue
to

participate
as
fully
as
possible
in
the
sacramental
and

spiritual
life
of
the
Catholic
Church
,
being
careful
not
to
give

scandal
to
others
who
may
be
confused
by
our
belief
or
behavior
.



If
we
are
led
by
a
morally
responsible
conscience
to
believe
or

act
in
a
way
which
is
contrary
to
what
the
Church
teaches
at
the

present
time
,
we
should
do
so
with
a
spirit
of
humility
and

respect
,
a
desire
to
remain
in
communion
with
the
Catholic
faith

community
,
and
the
intention
to
believe
and
obey
as
fully
as

possible
in
what
the
Church
believes
and
teaches
.



We
should
proceed
cautiously
and
with
patience
,
aware
of
our
own

limitations
and
sinfulness
,
always
desiring
to
be
transformed
by

God
'
s
love
and
mercy
.

The
New
Grown-Up


There’s
been
a
fundamental
shift
in
how
we
define
adulthood—and
at

what
pace
it
occurs
.


PT’s
authors
consider
how
a

iron-clad

construct
is
now
up
for
grabs—and
what
it
means
for
young
people’s

today

What
Is
Consciousness
?



How
to
define
the
elusive
concept
of
consciousness
.

Key
points

-
Consciousness
is
the
active
and
subjective
experiencing
aspect
of
an

experience
.


-
Consciousness
is
what
transforms
a
biochemical
state
into
an

experience
.


-
Although
we
have
mapped
brain
activity
to
specific
conscious

perceptions
,
we
still
don
'
t
know
how
this
gives
rise
to
conscious

experiences
.



Consciousness
is
what
we
are
most
familiar
with
.


Feeling
the
sun
'
s
warmth
on
our
face
,
the
joy
of
seeing
someone
we
love
,
or
the
thrill
of
being
on
a
rollercoaster—every
single
experience
we
ever
had
,
from
sensations
to
thoughts
and
emotions
,
is
linked
to
consciousness
.


It
seems
paradoxical
,
but
despite
being
at
the
centre
of
every
experience
,
consciousness
is
difficult
to
define
and
still
poorly
understood
scientifically
.



We
know
more
about
distant
galaxies
and
the
deepest
ocean
regions
than
we
do
about
our
consciousness
.


Even
though
consciousness
has
been
discussed
by
philosophers
for
millennia
and
has
become
an
active
and
thriving
field
of
scientific
research
,
it
remains
largely
a
mystery–but
a
strange
mystery
,
one
that
we
may
not
understand
well
but
are
intimately
acquainted
with
.



So
,
what
exactly
is
consciousness
?


Many
have
tried
to
answer
this
seemingly
simple
question
(I
will
cover
most
of
the
influential
views
on
this
blog)
,
but
a
universally
agreed-upon
definition
still
seems
elusive
.


Let’s
start
our
exploration
with
a
trip
to
the
dentist
.



Experiencing
an
Experience

Local
anesthesia
can
make
dental
surgery
a
lot
more
bearable
.


Specialised
neurons
that
detect
pain
called
nociceptors
still
respond
even
when
under
local
anesthesia
and
try
to
send
out
signals
to
alert
the
brain
to
tissue
damage
inside
the
mouth
.


While
some
local
anesthetics
reduce
nociceptor
activity
,
many
function
by
blocking
these
signals
from
being
passed
on
so
that
the
message
never
reaches
the
brain
(another
example
of
this
is
spinal
epidural
anesthesia
,
where
the
signaling
pathway
is
blocked
in
the
spinal
cord
rather
than
at
the
source
nociceptors
;
Olschewski
et
al
.


,
1998)
.


The
tissue
damage
in
the
mouth
is
simply
a
biological
state
,
and
any
nociceptor
response
is
just
a
biochemical
reaction
,
an
event
,
or
an
occurrence
without
any
associated
experience
.



When
we
bite
into
a
juicy
apple
(after
recovering
from
our
dental
surgery)
,
our
minds
cannot
directly
interact
with
the
apple
.


Whatever
the
mind
may
be
,
it
cannot
directly
taste
the
sweetness
,
sense
the
crunchy
texture
,
or
smell
the
chemicals
released
into
the
air
.


We
need
the
complex
sensory
machinery
inside
our
bodies
to
pick
up
on
these
things
,
encode
them
into
neural
signals
,
and
send
them
to
the
brain
.


When
the
upward
signaling
is
interrupted
(like
it
was
by
the
local
anesthesia
at
the
dentist)
,
all
of
this
is
merely
a
physiological
state
or
a
unique
biochemical
configuration
of
our
bodies
.



However
,
if
these
signals
reach
our
brains
when
awake
and
focused
,
something
extraordinary
happens
:
The
biological
signals
trigger
a
subjective
conscious
experience
.


We
still
don’t
know
much
about
how
or
why
this
happens
,
but
consciousness
lives
on
as
an
indisputable
aspect
of
our
minds
.


Although
mysterious
,
it
is
also
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
meaningful
aspects
of
our
human
experience
:
It
makes
life
worth
living
and
gives
us
an
innate
sense
of
value
and
worth
.


There
are
no
laws
against
throwing
a
rock
but
very
strict
laws
against
throwing
rocks
at
a
human
being
.



The
simple
reason
is
that
unlike
rocks—as
far
as
we
know—human
beings
have
the
capacity
to
experience
both
pain
and
joy
.


All
human
rights
and
the
famous
unalienable
right
to
life
,
liberty
,
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
,
found
in
the
U
.

S
.


Declaration
of
Independence
,
are
based
on
the
human
capacity
to
have
experiences
.


Consciousness
is
the
basis
for
our
experiences
and
undergirds
all
of
this
.



In
its
most
basic
sense
,
consciousness
is
linked
to
experience
.


In
a
way
,
it
turns
a
state
of
the
world
or
a
specific
configuration
of
atoms
,
molecules
,
organs
,
and
everything
else
into
an
experience
.


Another
way
to
look
at
it
is
as
the
active
experiencing
of
an
experience
.

Towards
Neural
Correlate
and
Back
to
Experience

Several
decades
of
thriving
research
have
uncovered
much
of
what
lies
behind
our
conscious
experiences
,
such
as
the
complex
and
intricate
brain
processes
required
to
piece
together
what
we
sense
coherently
.


Even
decoding
a
sound
'
s
origin
in
three-dimensional
space
requires
complex
computation
within
a
specialised
neural
architecture
.


Yet
,
we
are
not
directly
aware
of
any
of
these
myriad
operations
that
are
going
on
behind
the
scenes
and
effortlessly
turn
toward
the
direction
of
a
loud
sound
.


These
fascinating
insights
can
describe
the
brain
activity
associated
with
specific
conscious
perception
forms
in
great
detail
.


We
already
have
a
rich
catalogue
of
such
neural
correlates
,
and
new
findings
are
frequently
added
.



The
problem
is
that
while
neural
correlates
highlight
the
brain’s
necessary
work
in
the
background
that
makes
specific
conscious
experiences
possible
,
they
fail
to
explain
such
experiences
themselves
.


The
processes
are
unconscious
,
and
even
the
results
can
often
be
unconscious
,
like
when
we
are
distracted
or
when
a
stronger
stimulus
overrides
another
.


In
those
cases
,
the
exact
same
processes
do
not
result
in
a
conscious
experience
.



A
rollercoaster
can
provide
a
thrilling
ride
,
but
if
it
runs
empty
with
no
one
riding
it
,
no
thrill
is
experienced
.


This
does
not
mean
that
there
is
a
little
person
inside
watching
the
“theatre
of
the
mind”—what
the
British
philosopher
Gilbert
Ryle
(1949/2002)
mockingly
called
“the
dogma
of
the
Ghost
in
the
Machine
.

”
A
majority
of
scientists
and
philosophers
reject
this
notion
.


However
,
it
does
mean
that
even
though
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
are
incredibly
useful
,
they
don’t
fully
explain
what
consciousness
is
.

5
Things
About
the
Brain
You
Probably
Didn
'
t
Know

Anil
Seth
,
one
of
the
leading
researchers
in
this
field
,
suggests
that
the
ultimate
(or
what
he
calls
the
“real
question
of
consciousness”)
is
answering
why
a
particular
brain
activity
results
in
a
specific
conscious
experience
and
not
merely
establishing
that
it
does
(Seth
,
2021)
.



Experiences
need
explaining
beyond
their
mechanistic
underpinnings
.


Some
philosophers
have
gone
as
far
as
to
suggest
that
what
is
experienced
is
an
illusion
(Frankish
,
2016)
.


Yet
,
even
in
this
extreme
scenario
,
if
the
content
of
an
experience
is
truly
illusionary
(which
few
accept)
,
the
experience
itself
would
still
be
real
.


Any
philosophical
,
psychological
,
or
neurobiological
theory
of
consciousness
is
incomplete
without
a
full
account
of
experiences
,
which
brings
us
back
to
the
act
of
experiencing
.



What
exactly
is
consciousness
?



So
,
what
exactly
is
consciousness
?


It
is
what
we
are
most
familiar
with
and
what
undergirds
every
perception
,
emotion
,
and
thought
we
have
.


At
the
same
time
,
it
is
an
elusive
notion
that
is
difficult
to
define
.


I
would
suggest
that
it
is
linked
to
experiences
:
It
is
the
subjective
and
active
aspect
,
the
experiencing
of
an
experience
.

How
does
the
human
brain
create
consciousness
,
and
why
?

Scientists
and
philosophers
have
long
struggled
to
explain
how
the
brain
generates
conscious
experiences
.


Some
doubt
whether
the
objective
tools
of
science
can
ever
get
to
grips
with
a
phenomenon
that
is
so
subjective
.


Even
so
,
researchers
have
begun
to
identify
the
changes
in
brain
activity
that
accompany
awareness
,
and
they
also
have
some
fascinating
ideas
about
why
consciousness
evolved
.

How
much
do
we
really
know
about
human
consciousness
?


Image

Oxana
Pervomay/Stocksy
.



How
the
brain
conjures
conscious
awareness
from
the
electrical
activity
of
billions
of
individual
nerve
cells
remains
one
of
the
great
unanswered
questions
of
life
.



Each
of
us
knows
that
we
are
conscious
,
in
terms
of
having
thoughts
,
perceptions
,
and
feelings
,
but
we
are
unable
to
prove
it
to
anyone
else
.


Only
we
have
access
to
the
mysterious
essence
that
allows
us
to
experience
those
thoughts
,
perceptions
,
and
feelings
.



In
the
1990s
,
the
philosopher
David
Chalmers
described
this
inaccessibility
to
external
,
objective
scrutiny
as
the
“hard
problem”
of
consciousness
.



He
proposed
that
an
easier
task
for
scientists
to
tackle
would
be
its
“neural
correlates”
—
where
and
how
brain
activity
changes
when
people
have
conscious
experiences
.



Apart
from
curiosity
,
scientists
are
most
likely
motivated
to
discover
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
in
order
to
help
diagnose
and
treat
disorders
of
consciousness
,
such
as
persistent
vegetative
states
and
some
psychiatric
disorders
.



Three
dimensions
of
consciousness

Consciousness
has
several
distinct
dimensions
that
they
can
measure
.


Three
of
the
most
important
ones
are
:

-
wakefulness
or
physiological
arousal
-
awareness
or
the
ability
to
have
conscious
mental
experiences
,

including
thoughts
,
feelings
,
and
perceptions
-
sensory
organization
,
or
how
different
perceptions
and
more
abstract

concepts
become
woven
together
to
create
a
seamless
conscious

experience
.



These
three
dimensions
interact
to
produce
our
overall
state
of
consciousness
from
moment
to
moment
.


For
example
,
when
wide
awake
,
we
are
in
a
state
of
high
awareness
,
but
as
we
drift
off
to
sleep
at
night
,
both
wakefulness
and
awareness
subside
.



Awareness
and
physiological
arousal
return
during
REM
(rapid
eye
movement)
sleep
,
which
is
when
vivid
dreams
are
mostly
likely
to
occur
.


But
these
sensory
experiences
are
mostly
disconnected
from
external
stimuli
and
detached
from
the
concepts
that
anchor
us
to
reality
while
we
are
awake
.



In
a
similar
way
,
altered
states
of
consciousness
,
such
as
those
induced
by
psychedelic
drugs
or
low
oxygen
levels
,
involve
normal
levels
of
arousal
but
disorganized
sensory
experiences
.



These
can
include
hallucinations
of
sounds
,
smells
,
or
sights
,
but
also
synesthesia
,
when
there
is
cross-talk
between
usually
discrete
senses
,
such
as
sounds
that
evoke
visual
experiences
.



People
in
a
coma
,
or
under
anesthesia
,
can
have
levels
of
wakefulness
and
awareness
that
are
even
lower
than
during
non-REM
sleep
.



Meanwhile
,
in
a
strange
hybrid
state
of
consciousness
known
as
unresponsive
wakefulness
syndrome
,
or
a
vegetative
state
,
patients
undergo
daily
cycles
of
sleep
and
wakefulness
,
but
without
showing
any
sign
of
awareness
.



Despite
spending
long
periods
with
their
eyes
open
,
they
do
not
exhibit
behavioral
responses
to
external
stimuli
.



Some
of
these
patients
will
recover
limited
signs
of
awareness
,
known
as
a
“minimally
conscious
state
,”
such
as
the
ability
to
respond
to
instructions
or
follow
a
moving
object
with
their
eyes
.



The
neural
correlates
of
consciousness

Patients
in
different
states
of
consciousness
have
provided
vital
clues
about
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
.



Techniques
such
as
functional
magnetic
resonance
imaging
(fMRI)
and
electroencephalography
(EEG)
have
revealed
the
neural
activity
that
accompanies
these
states
.



Scientists
detect
patterns
of
activity
through
measures
of
functional
connectivity
,
using
statistical
techniques
to
reveal
correlations
between
the
timing
of
neural
events
in
different
parts
of
the
brain
.



This
reveals
the
networks
of
brain
regions
that
are
involved
in
working
memory
,
attention
,
and
mind-wandering
,
for
example
.



When
they
combine
data
from
fMRI
and
EEG
,
researchers
discover
that
activity
deep
inside
the
brain
,
in
the
thalamus
,
varies
during
wakefulness
in
step
with
activity
in
the
default
mode
network
.



The
thalamus
operates
like
a
sensory
relay
station
,
while
the
default
mode
network
is
a
collection
of
regions
within
the
cortex
—
the
outermost
layer
of
the
brain
—
that
are
intimately
involved
in
mind-wandering
and
self-awareness
.



By
contrast
,
during
non-REM
sleep
and
under
anesthetic
,
functional
connectivity
breaks
down
between
the
thalamus
and
the
default
mode
network
and
cortical
networks
that
are
involved
in
attention
.



In
disorders
of
consciousness
,
researchers
can
see
reduced
functional
connectivity
and
physical
damage
that
affects
the
connections
between
the
cortex
and
deep
brain
structures
.



This
demonstrates
how
important
these
connections
are
for
maintaining
wakefulness
and
information
exchange
across
the
brain
.



The
terrain
of
brain
activity

Despite
advances
in
our
understanding
of
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
,
however
,
doctors
still
have
trouble
diagnosing
patients
who
are
unable
to
respond
to
questions
or
commands
.



They
cannot
tell
whether
such
a
patient
is
completely
unconscious
,
conscious
but
disconnected
from
external
stimuli
,
or
conscious
and
aware
of
their
environment
,
but
unable
to
respond
.



A
completely
new
approach
,
reported
recently
in
Nature
Communications
,
may
provide
a
way
to
assess
such
a
patient’s
wakefulness
,
awareness
,
and
sensory
organization
.



Rather
than
recording
the
activity
in
particular
brain
regions
or
networks
of
regions
,
the
new
technique
measures
gradients
of
activity
across
the
brain
.



This
is
analogous
to
recording
the
steepness
of
terrain
on
a
map
,
and
how
that
steepness
might
change
over
time
,
rather
than
just
the
locations
of
roads
,
towns
,
and
villages
.



This
innovative
way
of
investigating
brain
activity
,
which
considers
how
functional
geometry
shapes
temporal
dynamics
,
takes
into
account
the
fact
that
each
region
and
network
has
multiple
functions
and
connections
.



“Consciousness
is
complex
and
studying
it
is
like
solving
a
scrambled
Rubik’s
cube
,”
says
first
author
Dr
.


Zirui
Huang
,
research
assistant
professor
at
the
University
of
Michigan
Medical
School
Department
of
Anesthesiology
.



“If
you
look
at
just
a
single
surface
,
you
may
be
confused
by
the
way
it
is
organized
.


You
need
to
work
on
the
puzzle
looking
at
all
dimensions
,”
he
adds
.



Three
gradients
of
consciousness

Dr
.


Huang
and
his
colleagues
looked
at
how
gradients
of
neural
activity
—
as
measured
by
fMRI
—
changed
with
the
three
main
dimensions
of
consciousness
:

-
arousability
or
wakefulness
-
awareness
-
sensory
integration
.



The
researchers
drew
on
existing
fMRI
data
recorded
from
the
brains
of
people
who
were
awake
,
under
anesthetic
,
in
a
so-called
vegetative
state
—
known
as
“unresponsive
wakefulness
syndrome”
—
or
who
had
a
psychiatric
diagnosis
such
as
schizophrenia
.



They
discovered
an
activity
gradient
that
corresponded
to
changes
in
arousal
levels
that
stretched
from
the
visual
and
default
mode
areas
to
networks
involved
in
attention
.



Another
gradient
changed
in
step
with
awareness
and
stretched
from
regions
involved
in
perception
and
action
to
regions
responsible
for
the
integration
of
information
and
formation
of
abstract
concepts
.



A
third
gradient
,
linked
to
sensory
organization
,
spanned
the
visual
system
and
the
somatomotor
cortex
,
which
helps
to
control
movement
.



“We
demonstrated
that
disruptions
of
human
consciousness
—
due
to
pharmacological
,
neuropathological
,
or
psychiatric
causes
—
are
associated
with
a
degradation
of
one
or
more
of
the
major
cortical
gradients
depending
on
the
state
,”
notes
Dr
.


Huang
.



He
told
Medical
News
Today
that
some
patients
who
are
unable
to
respond
in
any
way
may
still
be
conscious
.


“It
is
therefore
important
to
develop
behavior-independent
and
task-independent
approaches
to
assessment
,”
he
said
.



“According
to
our
work
,
cortical
gradient
measurements
have
the
potential
to
reduce
the
uncertainty
of
clinical
assessment
of
consciousness
in
those
patients
,”
he
added
.



Transcranial
magnetic
stimulation

Scientists
like
Dr
.


Huang
have
discovered
a
lot
about
its
neural
correlates
,
but
their
findings
do
not
shed
much
light
on
how
the
brain
generates
consciousness
—
the
“hard
problem”
.



Other
scientists
have
argued
that
to
learn
more
about
the
causes
of
consciousness
,
you
have
to
manipulate
brain
activity
and
see
what
happens
.



Transcranial
magnetic
stimulation
,
or
TMS
,
is
a
noninvasive
technique
that
changes
brain
activity
in
a
tightly
controlled
way
.



The
technique
involves
passing
a
strong
electrical
pulse
through
a
conductive
coil
held
close
to
the
participant’s
head
,
creating
a
brief
magnetic
pulse
that
induces
electrical
activity
in
the
part
of
the
brain
closest
to
the
coil
.



This
boosts
the
electrical
activity
of
millions
of
neurons
within
a
region
just
a
few
centimeters
in
diameter
.



In
an
awake
participant
,
a
TMS
pulse
triggers
a
complex
chain
of
activity
across
multiple
cortical
areas
,
whereas
in
non-REM
sleep
,
the
same
pulse
has
a
much
briefer
,
more
localized
effect
.



During
REM
sleep
,
however
,
the
pulse
evokes
a
pattern
of
activity
similar
to
that
seen
in
the
brain
of
a
person
who
is
wide
awake
.



Intriguingly
,
in
patients
who
are
awake
but
in
a
vegetative
state
,
TMS
induces
short-lived
,
local
effects
that
are
similar
to
those
seen
during
the
non-REM
sleep
of
a
healthy
person
.



But
in
the
brain
of
awake
,
minimally
conscious
patients
,
TMS
evokes
a
similar
response
to
that
seen
in
healthy
,
awake
people
.



Researchers
have
therefore
concluded
that
the
complexity
and
spatial
extent
of
communication
between
brain
regions
subsides
as
levels
of
wakefulness
and
awareness
fall
.



Theories
of
consciousness

Despite
advances
in
our
understanding
of
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
,
the
question
remains
:
How
does
consciousness
arise
from
brain
activity
?



Scientists
have
proposed
several
theories
.


Two
prominent
ideas
are
global
neuronal
workspace
theory
(GNWT)
and
integrated
information
theory
(IIT)
.



Global
neuronal
workspace

In
brief
,
GNWT
proposes
that
there
is
a
network
of
long-range
connections
that
span
the
brain
,
called
the
global
workspace
.



Neural
information
becomes
conscious
when
it
gains
access
to
this
workspace
,
which
allows
it
to
be
broadcast
throughout
the
brain
,
including
to
specialized
hubs
for
memory
,
perception
,
motor
output
,
and
attention
.



Crucially
,
it
is
a
case
of
“winner
takes
all”
for
a
particular
interpretation
of
sensory
data
when
it
gains
access
to
the
global
workspace
.



According
to
Prof
.


Michael
Graziano
,
professor
of
psychology
and
neuroscience
at
the
Princeton
Neuroscience
Institute
,
NJ
,
and
Dr
.


AaronSchurger
,
assistant
professor
in
the
Crean
College
of
Health
and
Behavioral
Sciences
at
Chapman
University
in
Irvine
,
CA
,
this
explains
,
for
example
,
“bistable”
optical
illusions
.



Two
examples
of
these
are
the
Necker
cube
and
face-vase
illusion
,
in
which
conscious
awareness
switches
between
two
alternative
interpretations
of
the
same
sensory
data
.



Integrated
information

The
communication
and
integration
of
information
between
brain
regions
is
at
the
heart
of
many
theories
of
consciousness
.



One
of
these
,
IIT
,
uses
a
complex
equation
to
calculate
an
entity’s
degree
of
consciousness
from
how
well
it
integrates
information
.



According
to
the
equation
,
even
inanimate
objects
such
as
rocks
and
teapots
have
a
glimmer
of
consciousness
.



This
is
in
keeping
with
the
philosophical
theory
of
panpsychism
,
which
proposes
that
consciousness
is
a
fundamental
property
of
all
physical
systems
.



How
it
feels
to
control
attention

Prof
.


Graziano
has
a
problem
with
all
these
theories
of
consciousness
.


He
argues
that
they
cannot
even
be
termed
theories
because
they
do
not
actually
explain
consciousness
,
they
only
describe
it
.



He
likens
this
to
the
difference
between
Newton’s
law
of
gravitation
,
which
is
an
equation
that
calculates
gravitational
force
,
and
Einstein’s
theory
of
general
relativity
,
which
explains
what
gravity
actually
is
.



Prof
.


Graziano’s
own
theory
of
consciousness
,
the
attention
schema
theory
,
or
AST
,
does
not
claim
to
have
cracked
the
hard
problem
of
consciousness
,
but
instead
seeks
to
explain
why
we
believe
we
are
conscious
.



According
to
AST
,
animal
brains
evolved
a
model
—
or
schema
—
of
their
current
state
of
attention
that
they
could
use
to
predict
and
control
their
ongoing
focus
of
attention
.



In
order
to
control
our
bodies
,
the
brain
uses
an
internal
model
of
our
limbs
,
their
location
in
space
,
and
how
they
work
.


Prof
.


Graziano
believes
the
control
of
attention
is
no
different
.



What
is
more
,
he
argues
that
the
attention
schema
leads
people
to
believe
that
they
have
an
internal
essence
—consciousness
—
that
allows
them
to
focus
their
attention
.



Content-free
awareness

Amazingly
,
expert
meditators
may
be
able
to
achieve
a
state
of
pure
awareness
,
free
from
any
thoughts
,
perceptions
,
feelings
,
or
even
a
sense
of
selfhood
,
time
,
or
space
.



This
special
state
of
consciousness
has
provided
more
clues
about
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
.



Researchers
at
the
University
of
Freiburg
in
Germany
used
EEG
to
study
the
brain
of
a
former
Buddhist
monk
who
described
this
as
a
“clear
,
aware
openness
.

”

They
found
that
content-free
awareness
was
associated
with
a
sharp
fall
in
alpha
waves
and
an
increase
in
theta
waves
.



There
was
also
a
decoupling
of
the
activity
of
the
sensory
cortex
and
dorsal
attention
network
,
but
strong
activity
within
the
attention
network
itself
.


Meanwhile
,
there
was
a
decline
in
the
activity
of
the
default
mode
network
.



Prof
.


Graziano
said
content-free
awareness
in
meditation
may
correspond
to
the
predictive
model
of
attention
described
in
his
theory
.



He
told
MNT
:


“I
think
the
model
of
attention
,
representing
the
property
of

attention
itself
,
is
possible
to
construct
in
isolation
,
unassociated

with
a
thing
to
which
you
are
attending
.


It
may
indeed
be
the

content-free
awareness
that
meditators
talk
about
.


I
do
think
that

meditation
is
essentially
practice
in
using
your
attention
schema
.

”

Even
without
thoughts
,
sensations
,
or
feelings
,
it
seems
the
mysterious
essence
of
conscious
awareness
remains
.

Is
Consciousness
Part
of
the
Fabric
of
the
Universe
?



A
theory
called
panpsychism
proposes
that
consciousness
is
a
fundamental
aspect
of
reality

More
than
400
years
ago
,
Galileo
showed
that
many
everyday
phenomena—such
as
a
ball
rolling
down
an
incline
or
a
chandelier
gently
swinging
from
a
church
ceiling—obey
precise
mathematical
laws
.


For
this
insight
,
he
is
often
hailed
as
the
founder
of
modern
science
.


But
Galileo
recognized
that
not
everything
was
amenable
to
a
quantitative
approach
.


Such
things
as
colors
,
tastes
and
smells
“are
no
more
than
mere
names
,”
Galileo
declared
,
for
“they
reside
only
in
consciousness
.

”
These
qualities
aren’t
really
out
there
in
the
world
,
he
asserted
,
but
exist
only
in
the
minds
of
creatures
that
perceive
them
.


“Hence
if
the
living
creature
were
removed
,”
he
wrote
,
“all
these
qualities
would
be
wiped
away
and
annihilated
.

”

Since
Galileo’s
time
the
physical
sciences
have
leaped
forward
,
explaining
the
workings
of
the
tiniest
quarks
to
the
largest
galaxy
clusters
.


But
explaining
things
that
reside
“only
in
consciousness”—the
red
of
a
sunset
,
say
,
or
the
bitter
taste
of
a
lemon—has
proven
far
more
difficult
.


Neuroscientists
have
identified
a
number
of
neural
correlates
of
consciousness—brain
states
associated
with
specific
mental
states—but
have
not
explained
how
matter
forms
minds
in
the
first
place
.


As
philosopher
Colin
McGinn
put
it
in
a
1989
paper
,
“Somehow
,
we
feel
,
the
water
of
the
physical
brain
is
turned
into
the
wine
of
consciousness
.

”
Philosopher
David
Chalmers
famously
dubbed
this
quandary the
“hard
problem”
of
consciousness
.

*

Scholars
recently
gathered
to
debate
the
problem
at
Marist
College
in
Poughkeepsie
,
N
.

Y
.


,
during
a
two-day
workshop
focused
on
an
idea
known
as panpsychism
.


The
concept
proposes
that
consciousness
is
a
fundamental
aspect
of
reality
,
like
mass
or
electrical
charge
.


The
idea
goes
back
to
antiquity—Plato
took
it
seriously—and
has
had
some
prominent
supporters
over
the
years
,
including
psychologist
William
James
and
philosopher
and
mathematician
Bertrand
Russell
.


Lately
it
is
seeing
renewed
interest
,
especially
following
the
2019
publication
of
philosopher
Philip
Goff’s
book
Galileo’s
Error
,
which
argues
forcefully
for
the
idea
.



Goff
,
of
the
University
of
Durham
in
England
,
organized
the
recent
event
along
with
Marist
philosopher
Andrei
Buckareff
,
and
it
was
funded
through
a
grant
from
the
John
Templeton
Foundation
.


In
a
small
lecture
hall
with
floor-to-ceiling
windows
overlooking
the
Hudson
River
,
roughly
two
dozen
scholars
probed
the
possibility
that
perhaps
it’s
consciousness
all
the
way
down
.



Part
of
the
appeal
of
panpsychism
is
that
it
appears
to
provide
a
workaround
to
the
question
posed
by
Chalmers
:
we
no
longer
have
to
worry
about
how
inanimate
matter
forms
minds
because
mindedness
was
there
all
along
,
residing
in
the
fabric
of
the
universe
.


Chalmers
himself
has
embraced
a
form
of
panpsychism
and
even
suggested
that
individual
particles
might
be
somehow
aware
.


He
said
in
a
TED
Talk
that
a
photon
“might
have
some
element
of
raw
,
subjective
feeling
,
some
primitive
precursor
to
consciousness
.

”
Also
on
board
with
the
idea
is
neuroscientist
Christof
Koch
,
who
noted
in
his
2012
book
Consciousness
that
if
one
accepts
consciousness
as
a
real
phenomenon
that’s
not
dependent
on
any
particular
material—that
it’s
“substrate-independent
,”
as
philosophers
put
it—then
“it
is
a
simple
step
to
conclude
that
the
entire
cosmos
is
suffused
with
sentience
.

”

Yet
panpsychism
runs
counter
to
the
majority
view
in
both
the
physical
sciences
and
in
philosophy
that
treats
consciousness
as
an
emergent
phenomenon
,
something
that
arises
in
certain
complex
systems
,
such
as
human
brains
.


In
this
view
,
individual
neurons
are
not
conscious
,
but
thanks
to
the
collective
properties
of
some
86
billion
neurons
and
their
interactions—which
,
admittedly
,
are
still
only
poorly
understood—brains
(along
with
bodies
,
perhaps)
are
conscious
.


Surveys
suggest
that
slightly
more
than
half
of
academic
philosophers
hold
this
view
,
known
as
“physicalism”
or
“emergentism
,”
whereas
about
one
third
reject
physicalism
and
lean
toward
some
alternative
,
of
which
panpsychism
is
one
of
several
possibilities
.



At
the
workshop
,
Goff
made
the
case
that
physics
has
missed
something
essential
when
it
comes
to
our
inner
mental
life
.


In
formulating
their
theories
,
“most
physicists
think
about
experiments
,”
he
said
.


“I
think
they
should
be
thinking
,
‘Is
my
theory
compatible
with
consciousness
?

’—because
we
know
that’s
real
.

”

Many
philosophers
at
the
meeting
appeared
to
share
Goff’s
concern
that
physicalism
falters
when
it
comes
to
consciousness
.


“If
you
know
every
last
detail
about
my
brain
processes
,
you
still
wouldn’t
know
what
it’s
like
to
be
me
,”
says
Hedda
Hassel
Mørch
,
a
philosopher
at
Inland
Norway
University
of
Applied
Sciences
.

 “There
is
a
clear
explanatory
gap
between
the
physical
and
the
mental
.

”
Consider
,
for
example
,
the
difficulty
of
trying
to
describe
color
to
someone
who
has
only
seen
the
world
in
black
and
white
.


Yanssel
Garcia
,
a
philosopher
at
the
University
of
Nebraska
Omaha
,
believes
that
physical
facts
alone
are
inadequate
for
such
a
task
.


“There
is
nothing
of
a
physical
sort
that
you
could
provide
[a
person
who
sees
only
in
shades
of
gray]
in
order
to
have
them
understand
what
color
experience
is
like
;
[they]
would
need
to
experience
it
themselves
,”
he
says
.


“Physical
science
is
,
in
principle
,
incapable
of
telling
us
the
complete
story
.

”
Of
the
various
alternatives
that
have
been
put
forward
,
he
says
that
“panpsychism
is
our
best
bet
.

”

But
panpsychism
attracts
many
critics
as
well
.


Some
point
out
that
it
doesn’t
explain
how
small
bits
of
consciousness
come
together
to
form
more
substantive
conscious
entities
.


Detractors
say
that
this
puzzle
,
known
as
the
“combination
problem
,”
amounts
to
panpsychism’s
own
version
of
the
hard
problem
.


The
combination
problem
“is
the
serious
challenge
for
the
panpsychist
position
,”
Goff
admits
.


“And
it’s
where
most
of
our
energies
are
going
.

”

Others
question
panpsychism’s
explanatory
power
.


In
his
2021
book
Being
You
,
neuroscientist
Anil
Seth
wrote
that
the
main
problems
with
panpsychism
are
that
“it
doesn’t
really
explain
anything
and
that
it
doesn’t
lead
to
testable
hypotheses
.


It’s
an
easy
get-out
to
the
apparent
mystery
posed
by
the
hard
problem
.

”

While
most
of
those
invited
to
the
workshop
were
philosophers
,
there
were
also
talks
by
physicists
Sean
Carroll
and
Lee
Smolin
and
by
cognitive
psychologist
Donald
Hoffman
.


Carroll
,
a
hardcore
physicalist
,
served
as
an
unofficial
leader
of
the
opposition
as
the
workshop
unfolded
.


(He
occasionally
quipped
,
“I’m
surrounded
by
panpsychists
!

”)
During
a
well-attended
public
debate
between
Goff
and
Carroll
,
the
divergence
of
their
worldviews
quickly
became
apparent
.


Goff
said
that
physicalism
has
led
“precisely
nowhere
,”
and
suggested
that
the
very
idea
of
trying
to
explain
consciousness
in
physical
terms
was
incoherent
.


Carroll
argued
that
physicalism
is
actually
doing
quite
well
and
that
although
consciousness
is
one
of
many
phenomena
that
can’t
be
inferred
from
the
goings-on
at
the
microscopic
level
,
it
is
nonetheless
a
real
,
emergent
feature
of
the
macroscopic
world
.


He
offered
the
physics
of
gases
as
a
parallel
example
.


At
the
micro
level
,
one
talks
of
atoms
,
molecules
and
forces
;
at
the
macro
level
,
one
speaks
of
pressure
,
volume
and
temperature
.


These
are
two
kinds
of
explanations
,
depending
on
the
“level”
being
studied—but
present no
great
mystery
and
are
not
a
failure
on
the
part
of
physics
.


Before
long
,
Goff
and
Carroll
were
deep
into
the
weeds
of
the
so-called
knowledge
argument
(also
known
as
“Mary
in
the
black
and
white
room”)
,
as
well
as
the
“zombie”
argument
.


Both boil
down
to
the
same
key
question
:
Is
there
something
about
consciousness
that
cannot
be
accounted
for
by
physical
facts
alone
?


Much
of
the
rhetorical
ping-pong
between
Goff
and
Carroll
amounted
to
Goff
answering
yes
to
that
question
and
Carroll
answering
no
.



Another
objection
some
attendees
raised
is
that
panpsychism
doesn’t
address
what
philosophers
call
the
“other
minds”
problem
.


(You
have
direct
access
to
your
own
mind—but
how
can
you
deduce
anything
at
all
about
another
person’s
mind
?

)
“Even
if
panpsychism
is
true
,
there
will
still
be
vast
amounts
of
things—namely
,
things
related
to
what
the
experiences
of
others
are
like—that
we
still
won’t
know
,”
says
Rebecca
Chan
,
a
philosopher
at
San
José
State
University
.

 She
worries
that
invoking
an
underlying
layer
of
mindedness
is
a
bit
like
invoking
God
.


“I
sometimes
wonder
if
the
panpsychist
position
is
similar
to
‘god
of
the
gaps’
arguments
,”
she
says
,
referring
to
the
notion
that
God
is
needed
to
fill
the
gaps
in
scientific
knowledge
.



Other
ideas
were
batted
around
.


The
idea
of
cosmopsychism
was
floated—roughly
,
the
notion
that
the
universe
itself
is
conscious
.


And
Paul
Draper
,
a
philosopher
at
Purdue
University
who
participated
via
Zoom
,
talked
about
a
subtly
different
idea
known
as
“psychological
ether
theory”—essentially
that
brains
don’t
produce
consciousness
but
rather
make
use
of
consciousness
.


In
this
view
,
consciousness
was
already
there
before
brains
existed
,
like
an
all-pervasive
ether
.


If
the
idea
is
correct
,
he
writes
,
“then
(in
all
likelihood)
God
exists
.

”

Hoffman
,
a
cognitive
scientist
at
the
University
of
California
,
Irvine
,
who
also
addressed
the
workshop
via
Zoom
,
advocates
rejecting
the
idea
of
spacetime
and
looking
for
something
deeper
.


(He
cited
the
increasingly
popular
idea
in
physics
lately
that
space
and
time
may
not
be
fundamental
but
may
instead
be
emergent
phenomena
themselves
.

)
The
deeper
entity
related
to
consciousness
,
Hoffman
suggests
,
may
consist
of
“subjects
and
experiences”
that
he
says
“are
entities
beyond
spacetime
,
not
within
spacetime
.

”
He
developed
this
idea
in
a
2023
paper
entitled
“Fusions
of
Consciousness
.

”

Smolin
,
a
physicist
at
the
Perimeter
Institute
for
Theoretical
Physics
in
Ontario
,
who
also
participated
via
Zoom
,
has
similarly
been
working
on
theories
that
appear
to
offer
a
more
central
role
for
conscious
agents
.


In
a
2020
paper
,
he
suggested
that
the
universe
“is
composed
of
a
set
of
partial
views
of
itself”
and
that
“conscious
perceptions
are
aspects
of
some
views”—a
perspective
that
he
says
can
be
thought
of
as
“a
restricted
form
of
panpsychism
.

”

Carroll
,
speaking
after
the
session
that
included
both
Hoffman
and
Smolin
,
noted
that
his
own
views
diverged
from
those
of
the
speakers
within
the
first
couple
of
minutes
.


(Over
lunch
,
he
noted
that
attending
the
workshop
sometimes
felt
like
being
on
a
subreddit
for
fans
of
a
TV
show
that
you’re
just
not
into
.

)
He
admitted
that
endless
debates
over
the
nature
of
“reality”
sometimes
left
him
frustrated
.


“People
ask
me
,
‘What
is
physical
reality
?

’
It’s
physical
reality
!


There’s
nothing
that
it
‘is
.

’
What
do
you
want
me
to
say
,
that
it’s
made
of
macaroni
or
something
?

”
(Even
Carroll
,
however
,
admits
that
there’s
more
to
reality
than
meets
the
eye
.


He’s
a
strong
supporter
of
the
“many
worlds”
interpretation
of
quantum
mechanics
,
which
holds
that
our
universe
is
just
one
facet
of
a
vast
quantum
multiverse
.

)

If
all
of
this
sounds
like
it
couldn’t
possibly
have
any
practical
value
,
Goff
raised
the
possibility
that
how
we
conceive
of
minds
can
have
ethical
implications
.


Take
the
question
of
whether
fish
feel
pain
.


Traditional
science
can
only
study
a
fish’s
outward
behavior
,
not
its
mental
state
.


To
Goff
,
focusing
on
the
fish’s
behavior
is
not
only
wrong-headed
but
“horrific”
because
it
leaves
out
what’s
actually
most
important—what
the
fish
actually
feels
.


“We’re
going
to
stop
asking
if
fish
are
conscious
and
just
look
at
their
behavior
?


Who
gives
a
shit
about
the
behavior
?


I
want
to
know
if
it
has
an
inner
life
;
that’s
all
that
matters
!

”
For
physicalists
such
as
Carroll
,
however
,
feelings
and
behavior
are
intimately
linked—which
means
we
can
avoid
causing
an
animal
to
suffer
by
not
putting
it
in
a
situation
where
it
appears
to
be
suffering
based
on
its
behavior
.


“If
there
were
no
connection
between
them
[behavior
and
feelings]
,
we
would
indeed
be
in
trouble
,”
says
Carroll
,
“but
that’s
not
our
world
.

”

Seth
,
the
neuroscientist
,
was
not
at
the
workshop—but
I
asked
him
where
he
stands
in
the
debate
over
physicalism
and
its
various
alternatives
.


Physicalism
,
he
says
,
still
offers
more
“empirical
grip”
than
its
competitors—and
he
laments
what
he
sees
as
excessive
hand-wringing
over
its
alleged
failures
,
including
the
supposed
hardness
of
the
hard
problem
.


“Critiquing
physicalism
on
the
basis
that
it
has
‘failed’
is
willful
mischaracterization
,”
he
says
.


“It’s
doing
just
fine
,
as
progress
in
consciousness
science
readily
attests
.

”
In
a
recently
published
article
in
the
Journal
of
Consciousness
Studies
,
Seth
adds
:
“Asserting
that
consciousness
is
fundamental
and
ubiquitous
does
nothing
to
shed
light
on
the
way
an
experience
of
blueness
is
the
way
it
is
,
and
not
some
other
way
.


Nor
does
it
explain
anything
about
the
possible
functions
of
consciousness
,
nor
why
consciousness
is
lost
in
states
such
as
dreamless
sleep
,
general
anaesthesia
,
and
coma
.

”

Even
those
who
lean
toward
panpsychism
sometimes
seem
hesitant
to
dive
into
the
deep
end
.


As
Garcia
put
it
,
in
spite
of
the
allure
of
a
universe
imbued
with
consciousness
,
“I
would
love
to
be
talked
out
of
it
.

”

The
universal
mind
,
or
universal
consciousness
,
is
a
metaphysical
concept
suggesting
an
underlying
essence
of
all
beings
and
becoming
in
the
universe
.


It
includes
the
being
and
becoming
that
occurred
in
the
universe
prior
to
the
emergence
of
the
concept
of
mind
,
a
term
that
more
appropriately
refers
to
the
organic
,
human
aspect
of
universal
consciousness
.


It
addresses
inorganic
being
and
becoming
and
the
interactions
that
occur
in
that
process
without
specific
reference
to
the
physical
and
chemical
laws
that
try
to
describe
those
interactions
.


Those
interactions
have
occurred
,
do
occur
,
and
continue
to
occur
.


Universal
consciousness
is
the
source
that
underlies
those
interactions
and
the
awareness
and
knowledge
they
imply
.



Introduction

[edit]

The
concept
of
the
universal
mind
was
presented
by
Anaxagoras
,
a
pre-Socratic
philosopher
who
arrived
in
Athens
some
time
after
480
BC
.


He
taught
that
the
growth
of
living
things
depends
on
the
power
of
mind
within
the
organisms
that
enables
them
to
extract
nourishment
from
surrounding
substances
.


For
this
concept
of
mind
,
Anaxagoras
was
commended
by
Aristotle
.


Both
Plato
and
Aristotle
,
however
,
objected
that
his
notion
of
mind
did
not
include
a
view
that
mind
acts
ethically
,
i
.

e
.


,
acts
for
the
“best
interests”
of
the
universe
.



The
most
original
aspect
of
Anaxagoras
'
s
system
was
his
doctrine
of
nous
("mind"
or
"reason")
.


A
different
Greek
word
,
gnósi
(knowledge)
,
better
reflects
what
is
observed
in
the
wider
world
of
organic
and
inorganic
beings
than
just
the
human
world
.



Chu
Ch’an
says
,
“The
universal
mind
,
therefore
,
is
something
to
which
nothing
can
be
attributed
.


Being
absolute
goes
beyond
attributes
.


If
,
for
example
,
it
were
to
be
described
as
infinite
,
that
would
exclude
from
it
whatever
is
finite
,
but
the
whole
argument
of
the
book
is
that
the
universal
mind
is
the
only
reality
and
that
everything
we
apprehend
through
our
senses
is
nothing
else
but
this
mind
.


Even
to
think
of
it
in
terms
of
existence
or
non-existence
is
to
misapprehend
it
entirely
.

”
pp
.


8–9

The
term
surfaced
again
in
later
philosophy
,
as
in
the
writings
of
Hegel
.


-
Hegel
writes
:


¤
377
The
knowledge
of
Mind
is
the
highest
and
hardest
,
just
because

it
is
the
most

'
concrete
'

of
sciences
.


The
significance
of
that


'
absolute
'

commandment
,
Know
thyself
−
whether
we
look
at
it
in
itself

or
under
the
historical
circumstances
of
its
first
utterance
−
is
not

to
promote
mere
self−knowledge
in
respect
of
the
particular

capacities
,
character
,
propensities
,
and
foibles
of
the
single
self
.



The
knowledge
it
commands
means
that
of
man
'
s
genuine
reality
−
of

what
is
essentially
and
ultimately
true
and
real
−
of
mind
as
the
true

and
essential
being
.

”

Descriptions

[edit]

There
are
no
definitions
of
the
Universal
Mind
,
but
two
authors
within
the
New
Thought
movement
offer
vague
descriptions
in
superlatives
such
as
omnipotence
.



Ernest
Holmes
,
the
founder
of
the
Science
of
Mind
movement
:


The
Universal
Mind
contains
any
knowledge
.


It
is
the
potential

ultimate
of
any
thing
.


To
it
things
are
possible
.

^([1])

New
Thought
author
Charles
Haanel
said
of
the
universal
mind
and
its
relationship
to
humans
:


The
Universal
Mind
has
unlimited
resources
at
its
command
,
and
when
we

remember
that
it
is
also
omnipresent
,
we
cannot
escape
the
conclusion

that
we
must
be
a
manifestation
of
that
Mind
.

^([2])

The
nature
of
the
universal
mind
is
said
to
be
omnipresent
.

Is
Consciousness
Universal
?



Panpsychism
,
the
ancient
doctrine
that
consciousness
is
universal
,
offers
some
lessons
in
how
to
think
about
subjective
experience
today

By
Christof
Koch

For
every
inside
there
is
an
outside
,
and
for
every
outside
there
is
an
inside
;
though
they
are
different
,
they
go
together
.


—Alan
Watts
,
Man
,
Nature
,
and
the
Nature
of
Man
,
1991

I
grew
up
in
a
devout
and
practicing
Roman
Catholic
family
with
Purzel
,
a
fearless
and
high-energy
dachshund
.


He
,
as
with
all
the
other
,
much
larger
dogs
that
subsequently
accompanied
me
through
life
,
showed
plenty
of
affection
,
curiosity
,
playfulness
,
aggression
,
anger
,
shame
and
fear
.


Yet
my
church
teaches
that
whereas
animals
,
as
God
'
s
creatures
,
ought
to
be
treated
well
,
they
do
not
possess
an
immortal
soul
.


Only
humans
do
.


Even
as
a
child
,
to
me
this
belief
felt
intuitively
wrong
.


These
gorgeous
creatures
had
feelings
,
just
like
I
did
.


Why
deny
them
?


Why
would
God
resurrect
people
but
not
dogs
?


This
core
Christian
belief
in
human
exceptionalism
did
not
make
any
sense
to
me
.


Whatever
consciousness
and
mind
are
and
no
matter
how
they
relate
to
the
brain
and
the
rest
of
the
body
,
I
felt
that
the
same
principle
must
hold
for
people
and
dogs
and
,
by
extension
,
for
other
animals
as
well
.



It
was
only
later
,
at
university
,
that
I
became
acquainted
with
Buddhism
and
its
emphasis
on
the
universal
nature
of
mind
.


Indeed
,
when
I
spent
a
week
with
His
Holiness
the
Dalai
Lama
earlier
in
2013
[see
“The
Brain
of
Buddha
,”
Consciousness
Redux
;
Scientific
American
Mind
,
July/August
2013]
,
I
noted
how
often
he
talked
about
the
need
to
reduce
the
suffering
of
“all
living
beings”
and
not
just
“all
people
.

”
My
readings
in
philosophy
brought
me
to
panpsychism
,
the
view
that
mind
(psyche)
is
found
everywhere
(pan)
.


Panpsychism
is
one
of
the
oldest
of
all
philosophical
doctrines
extant
and
was
put
forth
by
the
ancient
Greeks
,
in
particular
Thales
of
Miletus
and
Plato
.


Philosopher
Baruch
Spinoza
and
mathematician
and
universal
genius
Gottfried
Wilhelm
Leibniz
,
who
laid
down
the
intellectual
foundations
for
the
Age
of
Enlightenment
,
argued
for
panpsychism
,
as
did
philosopher
Arthur
Schopenhauer
,
father
of
American
psychology
William
James
,
and
Jesuit
paleontologist
Teilhard
de
Chardin
.


It
declined
in
popularity
with
the
rise
of
positivism
in
the
20th
century
.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

As
a
natural
scientist
,
I
find
a
version
of
panpsychism
modified
for
the
21st
century
to
be
the
single
most
elegant
and
parsimonious
explanation
for
the
universe
I
find
myself
in
.


There
are
three
broad
reasons
why
panpsychism
is
appealing
to
the
modern
mind
.



We
Are
All
Nature
'
s
Children

The
past
two
centuries
of
scientific
progress
have
made
it
difficult
to
sustain
a
belief
in
human
exceptionalism
.



Consider
my
Bernese
mountain
dog
,
Ruby
,
when
she
yelps
,
whines
,
gnaws
at
her
paw
,
limps
and
then
comes
to
me
,
seeking
aid
:
I
infer
that
she
is
in
pain
because
under
similar
conditions
I
behave
in
similar
ways
(sans
gnawing)
.


Physiological
measures
of
pain
confirm
this
inference—injured
dogs
,
just
like
people
,
experience
an
elevated
heart
rate
and
blood
pressure
and
release
stress
hormones
into
their
bloodstream
.


I
'
m
not
saying
that
a
dog
'
s
pain
is
exactly
like
human
pain
,
but
dogs—as
well
as
other
animals—not
only
react
to
noxious
stimuli
but
also
consciously
experience
pain
.



All
species—bees
,
octopuses
,
ravens
,
crows
,
magpies
,
parrots
,
tuna
,
mice
,
whales
,
dogs
,
cats
and
monkeys—are
capable
of
sophisticated
,
learned
,
nonstereotyped
behaviors
that
would
be
associated
with
consciousness
if
a
human
were
to
carry
out
such
actions
.


Precursors
of
behaviors
thought
to
be
unique
to
people
are
found
in
many
species
.


For
instance
,
bees
are
capable
of
recognizing
specific
faces
from
photographs
,
can
communicate
the
location
and
quality
of
food
sources
to
their
sisters
via
the
waggle
dance
,
and
can
navigate
complex
mazes
with
the
help
of
cues
they
store
in
short-term
memory
(for
instance
,
“after
arriving
at
a
fork
,
take
the
exit
marked
by
the
color
at
the
entrance”)
.


Bees
can
fly
several
kilometers
and
return
to
their
hive
,
a
remarkable
navigational
performance
.


And
a
scent
blown
into
the
hive
can
trigger
a
return
to
the
site
where
the
bees
previously
encountered
this
odor
.


This
type
of
associative
memory
was
famously
described
by
Marcel
Proust
in
À
la
Recherche
du
Temps
Perdu
.


Other
animals
can
recognize
themselves
,
know
when
their
conspecifics
observe
them
,
and
can
lie
and
cheat
.



Some
people
point
to
language
and
the
associated
benefits
as
being
the
unique
defining
feature
of
consciousness
.


Conveniently
,
this
viewpoint
rules
out
all
but
one
species
,
Homo
sapiens
(which
has
an
ineradicable
desire
to
come
out
on
top)
,
as
having
sentience
.


Yet
there
is
little
reason
to
deny
consciousness
to
animals
,
preverbal
infants
[see
“The
Conscious
Infant
,”
Consciousness
Redux
;
Scientific
American
Mind
,
September/October
2013]
or
patients
with
severe
aphasia
,
all
of
whom
are
mute
.



None
other
than
Charles
Darwin
,
in
the
last
book
he
published
,
in
the
year
preceding
his
death
,
set
out
to
learn
how
far
earthworms
“acted
consciously
and
how
much
mental
power
they
displayed
.

”
Studying
their
feeding
and
sexual
behaviors
for
several
decades—Darwin
was
after
all
a
naturalist
with
uncanny
powers
of
observation—he
concluded
that
there
was
no
absolute
threshold
between
lower
and
higher
animals
,
including
humans
,
that
assigned
higher
mental
powers
to
one
but
not
to
the
other
.



The
nervous
systems
of
all
these
creatures
are
highly
complex
.


Their
constitutive
proteins
,
genes
,
synapses
,
cells
and
neuronal
circuits
are
as
sophisticated
,
variegated
and
specialized
as
anything
seen
in
the
human
brain
.


It
is
difficult
to
find
anything
exceptional
about
the
human
brain
.


Even
its
size
is
not
so
special
,
because
elephants
,
dolphins
and
whales
have
bigger
brains
.


Only
an
expert
neuroanatomist
,
armed
with
a
microscope
,
can
tell
a
grain-size
piece
of
cortex
of
a
mouse
from
that
of
a
monkey
or
a
human
.


Biologists
emphasize
this
structural
and
behavioral
continuity
by
distinguishing
between
nonhuman
and
human
animals
.


We
are
all
nature
'
s
children
.



Given
the
lack
of
a
clear
and
compelling
Rubicon
separating
simple
from
complex
animals
and
simple
from
complex
behaviors
,
the
belief
that
only
humans
are
capable
of
experiencing
anything
consciously
seems
preposterous
.


A
much
more
reasonable
assumption
is
that
until
proved
otherwise
,
many
,
if
not
all
,
multicellular
organisms
experience
pain
and
pleasure
and
can
see
and
hear
the
sights
and
sounds
of
life
.


For
brains
that
are
smaller
and
less
complex
,
the
creatures
'

conscious
experience
is
very
likely
to
be
less
nuanced
,
less
differentiated
and
more
elemental
.


Even
a
worm
has
perhaps
the
vaguest
sense
of
being
alive
.


Of
course
,
each
species
has
its
own
unique
sensorium
,
matched
to
its
ecological
niche
.


Not
every
creature
has
ears
to
hear
and
eyes
to
see
.


Yet
all
are
capable
of
having
at
least
some
subjective
feelings
.



The
Austere
Appeal
of
Panpsychism

Taken
literally
,
panpsychism
is
the
belief
that
everything
is
“enminded
.

”
All
of
it
.


Whether
it
is
a
brain
,
a
tree
,
a
rock
or
an
electron
.


Everything
that
is
physical
also
possesses
an
interior
mental
aspect
.


One
is
objective—accessible
to
everybody—and
the
other
phenomenal—accessible
only
to
the
subject
.


That
is
the
sense
of
the
quotation
by
British-born
Buddhist
scholar
Alan
Watts
with
which
I
began
this
essay
.



I
will
defend
a
narrowed
,
more
nuanced
view
:
namely
that
any
complex
system
,
as
defined
below
,
has
the
basic
attributes
of
mind
and
has
a
minimal
amount
of
consciousness
in
the
sense
that
it
feels
like
something
to
be
that
system
.


If
the
system
falls
apart
,
consciousness
ceases
to
be
;
it
doesn
'
t
feel
like
anything
to
be
a
broken
system
.


And
the
more
complex
the
system
,
the
larger
the
repertoire
of
conscious
states
it
can
experience
.



My
subjective
experience
(and
yours
,
too
,
presumably)
,
the
Cartesian
“I
think
,
therefore
I
am
,”
is
an
undeniable
certainty
,
one
strong
enough
to
hold
the
weight
of
philosophy
.


But
from
whence
does
this
experience
come
?


Materialists
invoke
something
they
call
emergentism
to
explain
how
consciousness
can
be
absent
in
simple
nervous
systems
and
emerge
as
their
complexity
increases
.


Consider
the
wetness
of
water
,
its
ability
to
maintain
contact
with
surfaces
.


It
is
a
consequence
of
intermolecular
interactions
,
notably
hydrogen
bonding
among
nearby
water
molecules
.


One
or
two
molecules
of
H₂O
are
not
wet
,
but
put
gazillions
together
at
the
right
temperature
and
pressure
,
and
wetness
emerges
.


Or
see
how
the
laws
of
heredity
emerge
from
the
molecular
properties
of
DNA
,
RNA
and
proteins
.


By
the
same
process
,
mind
is
supposed
to
arise
out
of
sufficiently
complex
brains
.



Yet
the
mental
is
too
radically
different
for
it
to
arise
gradually
from
the
physical
.


This
emergence
of
subjective
feelings
from
physical
stuff
appears
inconceivable
and
is
at
odds
with
a
basic
precept
of
physical
thinking
,
the
Ur-conservation
law—ex
nihilo
nihil
fit
.


So
if
there
is
nothing
there
in
the
first
place
,
adding
a
little
bit
more
won
'
t
make
something
.


If
a
small
brain
won
'
t
be
able
to
feel
pain
,
why
should
a
large
brain
be
able
to
feel
the
god-awfulness
of
a
throbbing
toothache
?


Why
should
adding
some
neurons
give
rise
to
this
ineffable
feeling
?


The
phenomenal
hails
from
a
kingdom
other
than
the
physical
and
is
subject
to
different
laws
.


I
see
no
way
for
the
divide
between
unconscious
and
conscious
states
to
be
bridged
by
bigger
brains
or
more
complex
neurons
.



A
more
principled
solution
is
to
assume
that
consciousness
is
a
basic
feature
of
certain
types
of
so-called
complex
systems
(defined
in
some
universal
,
mathematical
manner)
.


And
that
complex
systems
have
sensation
,
whereas
simple
systems
have
none
.


This
reasoning
is
analogous
to
the
arguments
made
by
savants
studying
electrical
charge
in
the
18th
century
.


Charge
is
not
an
emergent
property
of
living
things
,
as
originally
thought
when
electricity
was
discovered
in
the
twitching
muscles
of
frogs
.


There
are
no
uncharged
particles
that
in
the
aggregate
produce
an
electrical
charge
.


Elementary
particles
either
have
some
charge
,
or
they
have
none
.


Thus
,
an
electron
has
one
negative
charge
,
a
proton
has
one
positive
charge
and
a
photon
,
the
carrier
of
light
,
has
zero
charge
.


As
far
as
chemistry
and
biology
are
concerned
,
charge
is
an
intrinsic
property
of
these
particles
.


Electrical
charge
does
not
emerge
from
noncharged
matter
.


It
is
the
same
,
goes
the
logic
,
with
consciousness
.


Consciousness
comes
with
organized
chunks
of
matter
.


It
is
immanent
in
the
organization
of
the
system
.


It
is
a
property
of
complex
entities
and
cannot
be
further
reduced
to
the
action
of
more
elementary
properties
.


We
have
reached
the
ground
floor
of
reductionism
.



Yet
,
as
traditionally
conceived
,
panpsychism
suffers
from
two
major
flaws
.


One
is
known
as
the
problem
of
aggregates
.


Philosopher
John
Searle
of
the
University
of
California
,
Berkeley
,
expressed
it
recently
:
“Consciousness
cannot
spread
over
the
universe
like
a
thin
veneer
of
jam
;
there
has
to
be
a
point
where
my
consciousness
ends
and
yours
begins
.

”
Indeed
,
if
consciousness
is
everywhere
,
why
should
it
not
animate
the
iPhone
,
the
Internet
or
the
United
States
of
America
?


Furthermore
,
panpsychism
does
not
explain
why
a
healthy
brain
is
conscious
,
whereas
the
same
brain
,
placed
inside
a
blender
and
reduced
to
goo
,
would
not
be
.


That
is
,
it
does
not
explain
how
aggregates
combine
to
produce
specific
conscious
experience
.



Integrated
Panpsychism

These
century-old
arguments
bring
me
to
the
conceptual
framework
of
the
integrated
information
theory
(IIT)
of
psychiatrist
and
neuroscientist
Giulio
Tononi
of
the
University
of
Wisconsin–Madison
.


It
postulates
that
conscious
experience
is
a
fundamental
aspect
of
reality
and
is
identical
to
a
particular
type
of
information—integrated
information
.


Consciousness
depends
on
a
physical
substrate
but
is
not
reducible
to
it
.


That
is
,
my
experience
of
seeing
an
aquamarine
blue
is
inexorably
linked
to
my
brain
but
is
different
from
my
brain
.



Any
system
that
possesses
some
nonzero
amount
of
integrated
information
experiences
something
.


Let
me
repeat
:
any
system
that
has
even
one
bit
of
integrated
information
has
a
very
minute
conscious
experience
.



IIT
makes
two
principled
assumptions
.


First
,
conscious
states
are
highly
differentiated
;
they
are
informationally
very
rich
.


You
can
be
conscious
of
an
uncountable
number
of
things
.


Think
of
all
the
frames
from
all
the
movies
that
you
have
ever
seen
or
that
have
ever
been
filmed
or
that
will
be
filmed
!


Each
frame
,
each
view
,
is
a
specific
conscious
percept
.



Second
,
each
such
experience
is
highly
integrated
.


You
cannot
force
yourself
to
see
the
world
in
black
and
white
;
its
color
is
an
integrated
part
of
your
view
.


Whatever
information
you
are
conscious
of
is
wholly
and
completely
presented
to
your
mind
;
it
cannot
be
subdivided
.


Underlying
this
unity
of
consciousness
is
a
multitude
of
causal
interactions
among
the
relevant
parts
of
your
brain
.


If
parts
of
the
brain
become
fragmented
and
balkanized
,
as
occurs
in
deep
sleep
or
in
anesthesia
,
consciousness
fades
.



To
be
conscious
,
then
,
you
need
to
be
a
single
,
integrated
entity
with
a
large
repertoire
of
highly
differentiated
states
.


Even
if
the
hard
disk
on
my
laptop
exceeds
in
capacity
my
lifetime
memories
,
none
of
its
information
is
integrated
.


The
family
photos
on
my
Mac
are
not
linked
to
one
another
.


The
computer
does
not
know
that
the
boy
in
those
pictures
is
my
son
as
he
matures
from
a
toddler
to
an
awkward
teenager
and
then
a
graceful
adult
.


To
my
computer
,
all
information
is
equally
meaningless
,
just
a
vast
,
random
tapestry
of
0s
and
1s
.


Yet
I
derive
meaning
from
these
images
because
my
memories
are
heavily
cross-linked
.


And
the
more
interconnected
,
the
more
meaningful
they
become
.



These
ideas
can
be
precisely
expressed
in
the
language
of
mathematics
using
notions
from
information
theory
such
as
entropy
.


Given
a
particular
brain
,
with
its
neurons
in
a
particular
state—these
neurons
are
firing
while
those
ones
are
quiet—one
can
precisely
compute
the
extent
to
which
this
network
is
integrated
.


From
this
calculation
,
the
theory
derives
a
single
number
,
&PHgr
(pronounced
“fi”)
[see
“A
Theory
of
Consciousness
,”
Consciousness
Redux
;
Scientific
American
Mind
,
July/August
2009]
.


Measured
in
bits
,
&PHgr
denotes
the
size
of
the
conscious
repertoire
associated
with
the
network
of
causally
interacting
parts
being
in
one
particular
state
.


Think
of
&PHgr
as
the
synergy
of
the
system
.


The
more
integrated
the
system
is
,
the
more
synergy
it
has
and
the
more
conscious
it
is
.


If
individual
brain
regions
are
too
isolated
from
one
another
or
are
interconnected
at
random
,
&PHgr
will
be
low
.


If
the
organism
has
many
neurons
and
is
richly
endowed
with
synaptic
connections
,
&PHgr
will
be
high
.


Basically
,
&PHgr
captures
the
quantity
of
consciousness
.


The
quality
of
any
one
experience—the
way
in
which
red
feels
different
from
blue
and
a
color
is
perceived
differently
from
a
tone—is
conveyed
by
the
informational
geometry
associated
with
&PHgr
.


The
theory
assigns
to
any
one
brain
state
a
shape
,
a
crystal
,
in
a
fantastically
high-dimensional
qualia
space
.


This
crystal
is
the
system
viewed
from
within
.


It
is
the
voice
in
the
head
,
the
light
inside
the
skull
.


It
is
everything
you
will
ever
know
of
the
world
.


It
is
your
only
reality
.


It
is
the
quiddity
of
experience
.


The
dream
of
the
lotus
eater
,
the
mindfulness
of
the
meditating
monk
and
the
agony
of
the
cancer
patient
all
feel
the
way
they
do
because
of
the
shape
of
the
distinct
crystals
in
a
space
of
a
trillion
dimensions—truly
a
beatific
vision
.


The
water
of
integrated
information
is
turned
into
the
wine
of
experience
.



Integrated
information
makes
very
specific
predictions
about
which
brain
circuits
are
involved
in
consciousness
and
which
ones
are
peripheral
players
(even
though
they
might
contain
many
more
neurons
,
their
anatomical
wiring
differs)
.


The
theory
has
most
recently
been
used
to
build
a
consciousness
meter
to
assess
,
in
a
quantitative
manner
,
the
extent
to
which
anesthetized
subjects
or
severely
brain-injured
patients
,
such
as
Terri
Schiavo
,
who
died
in
Florida
in
2005
,
are
truly
not
conscious
or
do
have
some
conscious
experiences
but
are
unable
to
signal
their
pain
and
discomfort
to
their
loved
ones
[see
“A
Consciousness
Meter
,”
Consciousness
Redux
;
Scientific
American
Mind
,
March/April
2013]
.



IIT
addresses
the
problem
of
aggregates
by
postulating
that
only
“local
maxima”
of
integrated
information
exist
(over
elements
and
spatial
and
temporal
scales)
:
my
consciousness
,
your
consciousness
,
but
nothing
in
between
.


That
is
,
every
person
living
in
the
U
.

S
.


is
,
self
by
self
,
conscious
,
but
there
is
no
superordinate
consciousness
of
the
U
.

S
.


population
as
a
whole
.



Unlike
classical
panpsychism
,
not
all
physical
objects
have
a
&PHgr
that
is
different
from
zero
.


Only
integrated
systems
do
.


A
bunch
of
disconnected
neurons
in
a
dish
,
a
heap
of
sand
,
a
galaxy
of
stars
or
a
black
hole—none
of
them
are
integrated
.


They
have
no
consciousness
.


They
do
not
have
mental
properties
.



Last
,
IIT
does
not
discriminate
between
squishy
brains
inside
skulls
and
silicon
circuits
encased
in
titanium
.


Provided
that
the
causal
relations
among
the
circuit
elements
,
transistors
and
other
logic
gates
give
rise
to
integrated
information
,
the
system
will
feel
like
something
.


Consider
humankind
'
s
largest
and
most
complex
artifact
,
the
Internet
.


It
consists
of
billions
of
computers
linked
together
using
optical
fibers
and
copper
cables
that
rapidly
instantiate
specific
connections
using
ultrafast
communication
protocols
.


Each
of
these
processors
in
turn
is
made
out
of
a
few
billion
transistors
.


Taken
as
a
whole
,
the
Internet
has
perhaps
10

¹⁹
transistors
,
about
the
number
of
synapses
in
the
brains
of
10
,000
people
.


Thus
,
its
sheer
number
of
components
exceeds
that
of
any
one
human
brain
.


Whether
or
not
the
Internet
today
feels
like
something
to
itself
is
completely
speculative
.


Still
,
it
is
certainly
conceivable
.



When
I
talk
and
write
about
panpsychism
,
I
often
encounter
blank
stares
of
incomprehension
.


Such
a
belief
violates
people
'
s
strongly
held
intuition
that
sentience
is
something
only
humans
and
a
few
closely
related
species
possess
.


Yet
our
intuition
also
fails
when
we
are
first
told
as
kids
that
a
whale
is
not
a
fish
but
a
mammal
or
that
people
on
the
other
side
of
the
planet
do
not
fall
off
because
they
are
upside
down
.


Panpsychism
is
an
elegant
explanation
for
the
most
basic
of
all
brute
facts
I
encounter
every
morning
on
awakening
:
there
is
subjective
experience
.


Tononi
'
s
theory
offers
a
scientific
,
constructive
,
predictive
and
mathematically
precise
form
of
panpsychism
for
the
21st
century
.


It
is
a
gigantic
step
in
the
final
resolution
of
the
ancient
mind-body
problem
.

Collective
consciousness
,
collective
conscience
,
or
collective
conscious
(French
:
conscience
collective)
is
the
set
of
shared
beliefs
,
ideas
,
and
moral
attitudes
which
operate
as
a
unifying
force
within
society
.

^([1])
In
general
,
it
does
not
refer
to
the
specifically
moral
conscience
,
but
to
a
shared
understanding
of
social
norms
.

^([2])

The
modern
concept
of
what
can
be
considered
collective
consciousness
includes
solidarity
attitudes
,
memes
,
extreme
behaviors
like
group-think
and
herd
behavior
,
and
collectively
shared
experiences
during
collective
rituals
,
dance
parties
,^([3])
and
the
discarnate
entities
which
can
be
experienced
from
psychedelic
use
.

^([4])
Rather
than
existing
as
separate
individuals
,
people
come
together
as
dynamic
groups
to
share
resources
and
knowledge
.


It
has
also
developed
as
a
way
of
describing
how
an
entire
community
comes
together
to
share
similar
values
.


This
has
also
been
termed
"hive
mind"
,
"group
mind"
,
"mass
mind"
,
and
"social
mind"
.

^([5])

Historical
use
of
collective
consciousness

[edit]

The
term
was
introduced
by
the
French
sociologist
Émile
Durkheim
in
his
The
Division
of
Labour
in
Society
in
1893
.


The
French
word
conscience
generally
means
"conscience"
,
"consciousness"
,
"awareness"
,^([6])
or
"perception"
.

^([7])
Given
the
multiplicity
of
definitions
,
translators
of
Durkheim
disagree
on
which
is
most
appropriate
,
or
whether
the
translation
should
depend
on
the
context
.


Some
prefer
to
treat
the
word

'
conscience
'

as
an
untranslatable
foreign
word
or
technical
term
,
without
its
normal
English
meaning
.

^([8])
As
for
"collective"
,
Durkheim
makes
clear
that
he
is
not
reifying
or
hypostasizing
this
concept
;
for
him
,
it
is
"collective"
simply
in
the
sense
that
it
is
common
to
many
individuals
;^([9])
cf
.


social
fact
.



Scipio
Sighele
published
‘La
Foule
Criminele’
one
year
before
Durkheim
,
in
which
he
describes
emergent
characteristics
of
crowds
that
don’t
appear
in
the
individuals
that
form
the
crowd
.


He
doesn’t
call
this
collective
consciousness
,
but
‘âme
de
la
foule’
(soul
of
the
crowd)
.

^([10])
This
term
returns
in
Sigmund
Freud’s
book
about
mass
psychology
and
essentially
overlaps
with
Durkheims
concept
of
collective
consciousness
.



Theories
of
collective
consciousness

[edit]

Durkheim

[edit]

Durkheim
used
the
term
in
his
books
The
Division
of
Labour
in
Society
(1893)
,
The
Rules
of
the
Sociological
Method
(1895)
,
Suicide
(1897)
,
and
The
Elementary
Forms
of
Religious
Life
(1912)
.


In
The
Division
of
Labour
,
Durkheim
argued
that
in
traditional/primitive
societies
(those
based
around
clan
,
family
or
tribal
relationships)
,
totemic
religion
played
an
important
role
in
uniting
members
through
the
creation
of
a
common
consciousness
.


In
societies
of
this
type
,
the
contents
of
an
individual
'
s
consciousness
are
largely
shared
in
common
with
all
other
members
of
their
society
,
creating
a
mechanical
solidarity
through
mutual
likeness
.




The
totality
of
beliefs
and
sentiments
common
to
the
average
members

of
a
society
forms
a
determinate
system
with
a
life
of
its
own
.


It
can

be
termed
the
collective
or
common
consciousness
.




—
Émile
Durkheim^([11])

In
Suicide
,
Durkheim
developed
the
concept
of
anomie
to
refer
to
the
social
rather
than
individual
causes
of
suicide
.


This
relates
to
the
concept
of
collective
consciousness
,
as
if
there
is
a
lack
of
integration
or
solidarity
in
society
then
suicide
rates
will
be
higher
.

^([12])

Gramsci

[edit]

Antonio
Gramsci
states
,
“A
collective
consciousness
,
which
is
to
say
a
living
organism
,
is
formed
only
after
the
unification
of
the
multiplicity
through
friction
on
the
part
of
the
individuals
;
nor
can
one
say
that
‘silence’
is
not
a
multiplicity
.

”^([13])
A
form
of
collective
consciousness
can
be
formed
from
Gramsci
'
s
conception
that
the
presence
of
a
hegemony
can
mobilize
the
collective
consciousness
of
those
oppressed
by
the
ruling
ideas
of
society
,
or
the
ruling
hegemony
.


Collective
consciousness
can
refer
to
a
multitude
of
different
individual
forms
of
consciousness
coalescing
into
a
greater
whole
.


In
Gramsci
'
s
view
,
a
unified
whole
is
composed
of
solidarity
among
its
different
constituent
parts
,
and
therefore
,
this
whole
cannot
be
uniformly
the
same
.


The
unified
whole
can
embrace
different
forms
of
consciousness
(or
individual
experiences
of
social
reality)
,
which
coexist
to
reflect
the
different
experiences
of
the
marginalized
peoples
in
a
given
society
.


This
agrees
with
Gramsci
'
s
theory
of
Marxism
and
class
struggle
applied
to
cultural
contexts
.


Cultural
Marxism
(as
distinguished
from
the
right-wing
use
of
the
term)
embodies
the
concept
of
collective
consciousness
.


It
incorporates
social
movements
that
are
based
on
some
sort
of
collective
identity
;
these
identities
can
include
,
for
instance
,
gender
,
sexual
orientation
,
race
,
and
ability
,
and
can
be
incorporated
by
collective-based
movements
into
a
broader
historical
material
analysis
of
class
struggle
.



According
to
Michelle
Filippini
,
“The
nature
and
workings
of
collective
organisms
–
not
only
parties
,
but
also
trade
unions
,
associations
and
intermediate
bodies
in
general
–
represent
a
specific
sphere
of
reflection
in
the
Prison
Notebooks
,
particularly
in
regard
to
the
new
relationship
between
State
and
society
that
in
Gramsci
'
s
view
emerged
during
the
age
of
mass
politics
.

”^([14])
Collective
organisms
can
express
collective
consciousness
.


Whether
this
form
of
expression
finds
itself
in
the
realm
of
the
state
or
the
realm
of
society
is
up
to
the
direction
that
the
subjects
take
in
expressing
their
collective
consciousness
.


In
Gramsci
'
s
Prison
Notebooks
,
the
ongoing
conflict
between
civil
society
,
the
bureaucracy
,
and
the
state
necessitates
the
emergence
of
a
collective
consciousness
that
can
often
act
as
an
intermediary
between
these
different
realms
.


The
public
organizations
of
protest
,
such
as
labor
unions
and
anti-war
organizations
,
are
vehicles
that
can
unite
multiple
types
of
collective
consciousness
.


Although
identity-based
movements
are
necessary
for
the
progress
of
democracy
and
can
generate
collective
consciousness
,
they
cannot
completely
do
so
without
a
unifying
framework
.


This
is
why
anti-war
and
labor
movements
provide
an
avenue
that
has
united
various
social
movements
under
the
banner
of
a
multiple
collective
consciousness
.


This
is
also
why
future
social
movements
need
to
have
an
ethos
of
collective
consciousness
if
they
are
to
succeed
in
the
long-term
.



Zukerfield

[edit]

Zukerfield
states
that
“The
different
disciplines
that
have
studied
knowledge
share
an
understanding
of
it
as
a
product
of
human
subjects
–
individual
,
collective
,
etc
.

”^([15])
Knowledge
in
a
sociological
sense
is
derived
from
social
conditions
and
social
realities
.


Collective
consciousness
also
reflects
social
realities
,
and
sociological
knowledge
can
be
gained
through
the
adoption
of
a
collective
consciousness
.


Many
different
disciplines
such
as
philosophy
and
literature
examine
collective
consciousness
from
different
lenses
.


These
different
disciplines
reach
a
similar
understanding
of
a
collective
consciousness
despite
their
different
approaches
to
the
subject
.


The
inherent
humanness
in
the
idea
of
collective
consciousness
refers
to
a
shared
way
of
thinking
among
human
beings
in
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
.



Collective
consciousness
can
provide
an
understanding
of
the
relationship
between
self
and
society
.


As
Zukerfeld
states
,
“Even
though
it
impels
us
,
as
a
first
customary
gesture
,
to
analyse
the
subjective
(such
as
individual
consciousness)
or
intersubjective
bearers
(such
as
the
values
of
a
given
society)
,
in
other
words
those
which
Marxism
and
sociology
examine
,
now
we
can
approach
them
in
an
entirely
different
light
.

”^([16])
“Cognitive
materialism”^([15])
is
presented
in
the
work
by
Zukerfeld
as
a
sort
of
‘third
way’
between
sociological
knowledge
and
Marxism
.


Cognitive
materialism
is
based
on
a
kind
of
collective
consciousness
of
the
mind
.


This
consciousness
can
be
used
,
with
cognitive
materialism
as
a
guiding
force
,
by
human
beings
in
order
to
critically
analyze
society
and
social
conditions
.



Collective
consciousness
in
society

[edit]

Society
is
made
up
of
various
collective
groups
,
such
as
the
family
,
community
,
organizations
,
regions
,
nations
which
as
Burns
and
Egdahl
state
"can
be
considered
to
possess
agential
capabilities
:
to
think
,
judge
,
decide
,
act
,
reform
;
to
conceptualize
self
and
others
as
well
as
self
'
s
actions
and
interactions
;
and
to
reflect
.

"
.

^([17])
It
is
suggested
that
these
different
national
behaviors
vary
according
to
the
different
collective
consciousness
between
nations
.


This
illustrates
that
differences
in
collective
consciousness
can
have
practical
significance
.



According
to
a
theory
,
the
character
of
collective
consciousness
depends
on
the
type
of
mnemonic
encoding
used
within
a
group
(Tsoukalas
,
2007)
.


The
specific
type
of
encoding
used
has
a
predictable
influence
on
the
group
'
s
behavior
and
collective
ideology
.


Informal
groups
,
that
meet
infrequently
and
spontaneously
,
have
a
tendency
to
represent
significant
aspects
of
their
community
as
episodic
memories
.


This
usually
leads
to
strong
social
cohesion
and
solidarity
,
an
indulgent
atmosphere
,
an
exclusive
ethos
and
a
restriction
of
social
networks
.


Formal
groups
,
that
have
scheduled
and
anonymous
meetings
,
tend
to
represent
significant
aspects
of
their
community
as
semantic
memories
which
usually
leads
to
weak
social
cohesion
and
solidarity
,
a
more
moderate
atmosphere
,
an
inclusive
ethos
and
an
expansion
of
social
networks
.

Literary
and
oral
tradition

[edit]

In
a
case
study
of
a
Serbian
folk
story
,
Wolfgang
Ernst
examines
collective
consciousness
in
terms
of
forms
of
media
,
specifically
collective
oral
and
literary
traditions
.


"Current
discourse
analysis
drifts
away
from
the

'
culturalist
turn
'

of
the
last
two
or
three
decades
and
its
concern
with
individual
and
collective
memory
as
an
extended
target
of
historical
research"
.

^([19])
There
is
still
a
collective
consciousness
present
in
terms
of
the
shared
appreciation
of
folk
stories
and
oral
traditions
.


Folk
stories
enable
the
subject
and
the
audiences
to
come
together
around
a
common
experience
and
a
shared
heritage
.


In
the
case
of
the
Serbian
folk
“gusle”
,^([20])
the
Serbian
people
take
pride
in
this
musical
instrument
of
epic
poetry
and
oral
tradition
and
play
it
at
social
gatherings
.


Expressions
of
art
and
culture
are
expressions
of
a
collective
consciousness
or
expressions
of
multiple
social
realities
.

Understanding
the
Mystery
of
Collective
Consciousness

Meridian
Team

The
intricate
labyrinth
that
is
the
human
psyche
has
been
a
topic
of
fascination
for
many
great
thinkers
,
drawing
the
attention
of
figures
such
as
Sigmund
Freud
and
Carl
Jung
.



Both
sought
to
map
out
the
territories
of
the
mind
,
but
it
was
Carl
Jung
who
delved
into
a
realm
that
transcends
personal
experience
.


At
the
crossroads
between
individuality
and
universality
,
the
collective
unconscious
emerges
.



Embark
with
us
as
we
navigate
the
profound
waters
of
the
"collective
unconscious
,"
unveiling
its
scientific
support
and
its
profound
resonance
with
many
people
.



[The
image
of
a
woman
gazing
into
the
distance
is
overlapped
with
an
image
of
the
cosmos]

In
the
tapestry
of
collective
consciousness
,
we
weave
our
individual
stories
into
a
greater
narrative
of
unity
.



What
is
the
collective
consciousness
theory
?



What
is
Durkheim
'
s
theory
of
collective
consciousness
?



Émile
Durkheim
,
a
pioneering
figure
in
sociology
,
coined
the
French
term
"conscience
collective
.

"
His
idea
of
collective
consciousness
refers
to
beliefs
and
sentiments
common
to
average
members
of
society
,
forming
a
determinate
system
that
has
its
own
life
.


According
to
Durkheim
,
this
system
could
be
investigated
using
the
sociological
method
,
and
it
sheds
light
on
how
societies
maintain
cohesion
and
solidarity
.



What
did
Carl
Jung
mean
by
collective
consciousness
?



Carl
Jung
,
the
pioneering
Swiss
psychiatrist
and
psychoanalyst
,
expanded
upon
prevailing
notions
of
shared
human
experience
.


While
earlier
thinkers
like
Durkheim
had
raised
the
subject
of
this
"collective
consciousness"
—
a
shared
set
of
beliefs
,
values
,
and
societal
norms
that
bind
communities
together
,
Jung
ventured
deeper
.



He
introduced
a
distinction
between
the
personal
unconscious
- 
a
reservoir
of
each
individual
'
s
memories
and
experiences
,
and
the
collective
unconscious
-
a
more
profound
layer
teeming
with
archetypes
.



These
archetypes
,
such
as
The
Hero
,
The
Mother
,
or
The
Shadow
,
are
universal
symbols
and
patterns
that
resonate
across
cultures
and
eras
,
deeply
embedded
in
our
shared
human
experience
.


They
surface
in
dreams
,
myths
,
and
artistic
expressions
,
revealing
shared
psychic
structures
that
shape
the
perceptions
of
all
humans
.



This
is
where
the
distinction
and
interplay
between
"collective
consciousness"
and
"collective
unconscious"
become
crucial
.



Durkheim
'
s
collective
consciousness
captures
the
conscious
agreements
that
make
societal
cohesion
possible
—
the
realm
of
shared
traditions
,
laws
,
and
cultural
norms
.



Building
upon
this
understanding
,
Jung
proposed
that
the
collective
unconscious
lies
beneath
this
layer
of
shared
consciousness
.

 
This
realm
is
not
about
societal
agreements
but
taps
into
innate
,
universal
symbols
and
themes
that
inform
societal
structures
and
animate
our
dreams
,
stories
,
and
behaviors
.

 
In
this
context
,
the
collective
unconscious
is
a
bedrock
of
the
human
psyche
,
highlighting
a
universality
that
surpasses
temporal
,
cultural
,
and
individual
boundaries
.



Is
the
collective
unconscious
real
?



The
empirical
path
to
proving
Jung’s
collective
unconscious
is
a
complex
journey
,
threading
its
way
through
diverse
fields
of
study
.



Jung
'
s
exploration
into
the
collective
unconscious
pointed
towards
shared
archetypal
symbols
inherent
within
the
human
psyche
.


This
notion
is
supported
by
various
spiritual
traditions
,
from
the
Hindu
Kecak
chanters
of
Indonesia
to
the

'
gathered
'

meetings
of
American
Quakers
.



Similarly
,
studies
have
highlighted
instances
of
collective
consciousness
during
advanced
states
of
group
meditation
and
within
oral
cultures
,
such
as
the
Australian
Aborigines
and
the
San
people
of
Africa
.



From
the
perspective
of
natural
sciences
,
our
current
understanding
seems
to
fall
short
in
explaining
these
phenomena
.


But
there
is
no
shortage
of
theories
.



Insights
into
the
evolution
of
human
communication
reveal
fascinating
discoveries
,
such
as
mirror
neurons
,
which
respond
to
intentions
and
emotions
.


There
is
speculation
that
these
neurons
could
be
central
in
fostering
collective
experiences
,
playing
a
significant
role
in
the
emergence
of
language
and
reflective
self-consciousness
.



What
are
examples
of
the
collective
consciousness
?



-
Archetypes
:
Archetypes
like
“the
Mother
,”
“the
Hero
,”
or
“the

Shadow”
are
present
across
cultures
and
eras
.


These
serve
as
windows

into
our
shared
psychic
space
.


-
Dreams
:
Common
dream
themes
,
from
flights
to
pursuits
,
can
be

perceived
as
ripples
from
our
collective
unconscious
,
transcending

personal
experience
.


-
Myths
and
Legends
:
Age-old
tales
,
whether
of
heroes
or
mystical

creatures
,
have
sprung
up
with
similar
themes
across
many
cultures
,

speaking
to
a
shared
human
narrative
.


-
Symbols
and
Motifs
:
Consider
the
mandala
–
a
geometric
configuration

of
symbols
–
that
appears
in
spiritual
practices
from
Tibetan

Buddhism
and
in
Native
American
traditions
.


Or
the
ubiquitous
symbol

of
the
serpent
,
which
has
been
interpreted
as
everything
from
a

harbinger
of
danger
to
a
symbol
of
knowledge
and
rebirth
.


These

recurring
symbols
,
though
expressed
differently
,
imply
a
shared
pool

of
thought
.


-
Rites
and
Rituals
:
The
practices
surrounding
life
and
death
,

marriage
,
and
passage
into
adulthood
are
remarkably
similar
across

distant
cultures
.


While
the
specifics
vary
–
a
Bar
Mitzvah
,
a

Quinceañera
,
or
a
tribal
initiation
rite
–
the
essence
remains

intact
.


This
is
a
universal
nod
to
the
significant
phases
in
human

life
.


-
Art
and
Expression
:
Cave
paintings
,
from
the
renowned
Lascaux
in

France
to
the
Bhimbetka
shelters
in
India
showcase
an
uncanny

similarity
.


Whether
portraying
the
hunt
,
dance
,
or
mere
existence
,

these
prehistoric
remnants
bear
testimony
to
a
shared
aesthetic

instinct
and
an
innate
urge
to
document
our
experiences
.


-
Moral
Codes
and
Ethics
:
While
laws
and
guidelines
vary
from
culture

to
culture
,
fundamental
principles
,
such
as
those
surrounding

murder
,
theft
,
and
honesty
,
remain
strikingly
consistent
.


These

shared
ethical
compasses
suggest
a
deeply
embedded
collective

understanding
of
right
and
wrong
.


-
The
Dance
of
Nature
:
From
the
ancient
Celts
celebrating
the
solstice

to
Native
American
rain
dances
,
the
collective
unconscious
reveals

itself
in
humanity
'
s
shared
reverence
of
nature
.


These
practices

imply
that
,
as
a
species
,
we
are
intrinsically
connected
to
the

world
around
us
,
celebrating
its
beauty
,
power
,
and
mystery
.



The
takeaway

[A
group
of
people
spanning
multiple
ethnicities
and
identities
stand
in
a
semicircle
and
join
their
hands
together
at
the
center
.

]

The
realm
of
collective
consciousness
draws
attention
to
the
intricate
psychological
webs
that
unify
us
,
even
when
faced
with
our
distinct
differences
.



In
the
grand
tapestry
of
humanity
,
the
concept
of
collective
consciousness
serves
as
a
gentle
reminder
that
,
beyond
our
cultural
and
experiential
divides
,
we
are
united
by
an
undercurrent
of
shared
beliefs
,
sentiments
,
and
archetypes
.



"In
all
chaos
,
there
is
a
cosmos
,
in
all
disorder
a
secret
order
.

"
-
Carl
Jung
.

Collective
consciousness
(sometimes
collective
conscience
or
conscious)
is
a
fundamental
sociological
concept
that
refers
to
the
set
of
shared
beliefs
,
ideas
,
attitudes
,
and
knowledge
that
are
common
to
a
social
group
or
society
.


The
collective
consciousness
informs
our
sense
of
belonging
and
identity
,
and
our
behavior
.


Founding
sociologist
Émile
Durkheim
developed
this
concept
to
explain
how
unique
individuals
are
bound
together
into
collective
units
like
social
groups
and
societies
.




How
Collective
Consciousness
Holds
Society
Together


What
is
it
that
holds
society
together
?


This
was
the
central
question
that
preoccupied
Durkheim
as
he
wrote
about
the
new
industrial
societies
of
the
19th
century
.


By
considering
the
documented
habits
,
customs
,
and
beliefs
of
traditional
and
primitive
societies
,
and
comparing
those
to
what
he
saw
around
him
in
his
own
life
,
Durkheim
crafted
some
of
the
most
important
theories
in
sociology
.


He
concluded
that
society
exists
because
unique
individuals
feel
a
sense
of
solidarity
with
each
other
.


This
is
why
we
can
form
collectives
and
work
together
to
achieve
community
and
functional
societies
.


The
collective
consciousness
,
or conscience
collective as
he
wrote
it
in
French
,
is
the
source
of
this
solidarity
.



Durkheim
first
introduced
his
theory
of
the
collective
consciousness
in
his
1893
book
"The
Division
of
Labor
in
Society"
.


(Later
,
he
would
also
rely
on
the
concept
in
other
books
,
including
"Rules
of
the
Sociological
Method"
,
"Suicide"
,
and
"The
Elementary
Forms
of
Religious
Life"
.

) In
this
text
,
he
explains
that
the
phenomenon
is
"the
totality
of
beliefs
and
sentiments
common
to
the
average
members
of
a
society
.

"
Durkheim
observed
that
in
traditional
or
primitive
societies
, religious
symbols
,
discourse
,
beliefs
,
and
rituals
fostered
the
collective
consciousness
.


In
such
cases
,
where
social
groups
were
quite
homogenous
(not
distinct
by
race
or
class
,
for
example)
,
the
collective
consciousness
resulted
in
what
Durkheim
termed
a
"mechanical
solidarity"
—
in
effect
an
automatic
binding
together
of
people
into
a
collective
through
their
shared
values
,
beliefs
,
and
practices
.



Durkheim
observed
that
in
the
modern
,
industrialized
societies
that
characterized
Western
Europe
and
the
young
United
States
when
he
wrote
,
which
functioned
via
a
division
of
labor
,
an
"organic
solidarity"
emerged
based
on
the
mutual
reliance
individuals
and
groups
had
on
others
in
order
to
allow
for
a
society
to
function
.


In
cases
such
as
these
,
religion
still
played
an
important
role
in
producing
collective
consciousness
among
groups
of
people
affiliated
with
various
religions
,
but
other
social
institutions
and
structures
would
also
work
to
produce
the
collective
consciousness
necessary
for
this
more
complex
form
of
solidarity
,
and
rituals
outside
of
religion
would
play
important
roles
in
reaffirming
it
.




Social
Institutions
Produce
Collective
Consciousness


These
other
institutions
include
the
state
(which
fosters
patriotism
and
nationalism)
,
news
and
popular
media
(which
spreads
all
kinds
of
ideas
and
practices
,
from
how
to
dress
,
to
who
to
vote
for
,
to
how
to
date
and
be
married)
,
education
(which
molds
us
into
compliant
citizens
and
workers)
,
and
the
police
and
judiciary
(which
shape
our
notions
of
right
and
wrong
,
and
direct
our
behavior
through
threat
of
or
actual
physical
force)
,
among
others
.


Rituals
that
serve
to
reaffirm
the
collective
conscious
range
from
parades
and
holiday
celebrations
to
sporting
events
,
weddings
,
grooming
ourselves
according
to
gender
norms
,
and
even
shopping
(think
Black
Friday)
.



In
either
case
—
primitive
or
modern
societies
—
collective
consciousness
is
something
"common
to
the
whole
of
society
,"
as
Durkheim
put
it
.


It
is
not
an
individual
condition
or
phenomenon
,
but
a
social
one
.


As
a
social
phenomenon
,
it
is
"diffused
across
society
as
a
whole
,"
and
"has
a
life
of
its
own
.

"
It
is
through
collective
consciousness
that
values
,
beliefs
,
and
traditions
can
be
passed
down
through
generations
.


Though
individual
people
live
and
die
,
this
collection
of
intangible
things
,
including
the
social
norms
connected
to
them
,
are
cemented
in
our
social
institutions
and
thus
exist
independent
of
individual
people
.



Most
important
to
understand
is
that
collective
consciousness
is
the
result
of
social
forces
that
are
external
to
the
individual
,
that
course
through
society
,
and
that
work
together
to
create
the
social
phenomenon
of
the
shared
set
of
beliefs
,
values
,
and
ideas
that
compose
it
.


We
,
as
individuals
,
internalize
these
and make
the
collective
consciousness
a
reality
by
doing
so
,
and
we
reaffirm
and
reproduce
it
by
living
in
ways
that
reflect
it
.

Consciousness
shared
by
individuals
within
a
society

Social
consciousness
or
social
awareness
,
is
collective
consciousness
shared
by
individuals
within
a
society
.

^([1])

Social
consciousness
is
linked
to
the
collective
self-awareness
and
experience
of
collectively
shared
social
identity
.

^([2])
From
this
viewpoint
,
social
consciousness
denotes
conscious
awareness
of
being
part
of
an
interrelated
community
of
others
.


The
“we
feeling”
or
the
“sense
of
us”
may
be
experienced
in
members
of
various
cultures
and
social
groups
.


By
the
experience
of
collectively
shared
social
identity
,
individuals
may
experience
social
unity
.


Social
consciousness
may
also
stimulate
working
towards
a
common
goal
.



According
to
Karl
Marx
,
human
beings
enter
into
certain
productive
,
or
economic
,
relations
and
these
relations
lead
to
a
form
of
social
consciousness
.

^([1])
Marx
said
:


"In
the
social
production
of
their
life
,
men
enter
into
definite

relations
that
are
indispensable
and
independent
of
their
will
;
these

relations
of
production
correspond
to
a
definite
stage
of
development

of
their
material
forces
of
production
.


The
sum
total
of
these

relations
of
production
constitutes
the
economic
structure
of
society

—
the
real
foundation
,
on
which
rises
a
legal
and
political

superstructure
and
to
which
correspond
definite
forms
of
social

consciousness
.


The
mode
of
production
of
material
life
determines
the

social
,
political
and
intellectual
life
process
in
general
.


It
is
not

the
consciousness
of
men
that
determines
their
being
,
but
,
on
the

contrary
,
their
social
being
that
determines
their

consciousness
.

Being

Leadership

Sep

Written
By
Jon
Mertz

What
does
a
leader
of
conscience
mean
?


It
begins
with
character
to
avoid
distorted
values
with
a
centered
focus
on
virtues
of
humanity
.


A
leader
of
conscience
engages
in
community
conversations
and
identifies
what
virtues
to
act
upon
in
the
choices
being
made
.



Sparked
by
Professor
Richard
Shell
'
s
new
book
,
The
Conscience
Code
,
I
explored
what
being
conscience
means
.


It
led
me
to
the
Ethics
Centre
,
a
non-profit
in
Sydney
,
Australia
.


The
Ethics
Centre
defines
conscience
as
:

1
.


What
a
person
believes
is
right
,
and

2
.


How
a
person
decides
what
is
right

While
conscience
sounds
simple
,
it
quickly
gets
complicated
as
we
encounter
situations
in
which
variables
challenge
us
in
what
we
believe
and
what
we
decide
is
right
.


In
some
cases
,
our
conscientious
voice
gets
it
right
immediately
.


Other
times
,
confusion
reigns
.



Our
conscience
and
character
are
intimately
linked
.



Our
character
builds
specific
values
,
and
those
values
become
engraved
in
our
souls
.


While
values
are
essential
,
they
have
become
distorted
,
resulting
in
dogmatic
views
without
any
clear
perspective
of
what
is
right
.



Professor
Shell
highlights
three
elements
of
character
.


They
are
:

1
.


Must
have
moral
impulses
–
prompts
us
to
behave
well
and
resist

temptations
and
pressures

2
.


Must
have
the
awareness
to
know
what
values
are
relevant
in
the

situation
you
face

3
.


Must
bring
self-discipline
to
own
a
situation
and
act
on
your
values

–
even
when
costly
or
inconvenient

These
character
elements
resonate
.


However
,
they
still
rest
on
values
,
which
may
be
a
problem
today
.



Rather
than
focus
on
values
,
we
need
to
raise
our
character
to
embrace
virtues
.



In
pulling
the
thread
on
virtues
,
another
center
came
to
the
forefront
.


The
Markkula
Center
for
Applied
Ethics
at
Santa
Clara
University
discusses
virtues
as
a
focus
on
the
full
development
of
humanity
.


Virtues
are
"attitudes
,
dispositions
,
or
character
traits
that
enable
us
to
be
and
to
act
in
ways
that
develop
this
potential
[humanity]
.

"
The
development
of
humanity
is
crucial
when
considering
our
conscience
and
how
we
decide
what
to
do
in
challenging
situations
.



Another
significant
point
on
virtues
is
that
they
are
developed
through
learning
and
practice
.


A
community
component
is
embedded
.


For
me
,
this
means
that
we
should
(and
must)
have
conversations
about
what
virtues
are
essential
in
our
civic
and
business
discourse
.


It
is
a
higher-level
conversation
,
which
leads
to
a
focus
beyond
our
self-interests
.



Connecting
conscience
to
character
and
virtues
is
imperative
.



Too
often
lately
,
values
are
being
distorted
to
protect
a
power
base
rather
than
engaging
the
value
in
how
it
helps
humanity
.


Making
a
switch
to
virtues
can
raise
the
leadership
standard
.


A
new
conscience
accountability
checklist
:

-
After
our
conscience
determines
an
approach
,
ask
what
virtue

supports
the
decision
.



-
With
the
selected
decision
,
ask
what
the
impact
on
humanity
will
be
.



-
If
you
have
not
explored
the
impacted
virtue
with
others
,
then
put

the
decision
aside
until
you
do
.



We
all
need
to
engage
in
conversations
about
virtues
and
begin
to
raise
the
standard
of
being
a
leader
of
conscience
.

In
Marxism
,
class
consciousness
is
the
set
of
beliefs
that
persons
hold
regarding
their
social
class
or
economic
rank
in
society
,
the
structure
of
their
class
,
and
their
common
class
interests
.

^([1][2])
According
to
Karl
Marx
,
class
consciousness
is
an
awareness
that
is
key
to
sparking
a
revolution
which
would
"create
a
dictatorship
of
the
proletariat
,
transforming
it
from
a
wage-earning
,
propertyless
mass
into
the
ruling
class"
.

^([3])

Although
Marxists
tend
to
focus
on
class
consciousness
(or
its
absence)
among
the
proletariat
,
the
upper
classes
in
society
can
also
think
and
act
in
a
class-conscious
way
.


As
Leonard
Fein
pointed
out
,
"The
very
rich
have
been
well
aware
of
their
class
privilege
and
have
labored
mightily
to
protect
and
defend
it"
.

^([4][5])
For
example
,
Warren
Buffett
has
demonstrated
class
consciousness
:
"There
'
s
class
warfare
,
all
right
.


.


.


but
it
'
s
my
class
,
the
rich
class
,
that
'
s
making
war
,
and
we
'
re
winning
.

"^([6])

Marxist
theory

[edit]

Early
in
the
19th
century
,
the
labels
"working
classes"
and
"middle
classes"
were
coming
into
common
usage
in
British
society
.


David
Cody
writes
about
this
time
period
:
"The
old
hereditary
aristocracy
,
reinforced
by
the
new
gentry
who
owed
their
success
to
commerce
,
industry
,
and
the
professions
,
evolved
into
an

'
upper
class
'

(its
consciousness
formed
in
large
part
by
the
Public
Schools
and
Universities)
which
tenaciously
maintained
control
over
the
political
system
,
depriving
not
only
the
working
classes
but
the
middle
classes
of
a
voice
in
the
political
process
.

"^([7])
As
the
Industrial
Revolution
progressed
,
the
sharpening
of
socioeconomic
divisions
caused
each
group
to
become
more
acutely
conscious
of
its
position
in
the
hierarchy
.

^([7])

While
Karl
Marx
rarely
used
the
term
"class
consciousness"
,
he
did
make
the
distinction
between
"class
in
itself"
,
which
is
defined
as
a
stratum
of
society
sharing
common
grievances
and
a
unified
perspective
;
and
a
"class
for
itself"
,
which
is
defined
as
a
stratum
organized
in
active
pursuit
of
its
own
interests
.

^([8])

Categorizing
a
person
'
s
social
class
can
be
a
determinant
for
their
awareness
of
it
.


Marxists
categorize
classes
based
on
their
relation
to
the
means
of
production
,
especially
on
whether
or
not
members
of
the
class
own
capital
.


Non-Marxists
differentiate
society
'
s
various
groups
based
on
social
stratification
,
i
.

e
.


,
income
,
race
,
gender
,
ethnicity
,
education
,
occupation
,
or
status
.

^([9][10][11])

Whereas
Marx
believed
the
working
class
would
gain
class
consciousness
as
a
result
of
its
experience
of
exploitation
,
later
orthodox
Marxism
,
in
particular
as
formulated
by
Vladimir
Lenin
,
argued
that
the
working
class
,
by
itself
,
could
only
develop
"trade
union
consciousness"
,
which
Lenin
characterized
in
What
Is
to
Be
Done
?


as
"the
conviction
that
it
is
necessary
to
combine
in
unions
,
fight
the
employers
,
and
strive
to
compel
the
government
to
pass
necessary
labour
legislation
.

"^([12])
To
overcome
this
(in
Lenin
'
s
opinion)
limited
worldview
,
a
vanguard
party
of
the
most
politically
advanced
section
of
the

Criticism

[edit]

The
Polish
political
philosopher
Leszek
Kolakowski
disputed
the
notion
that
class
consciousness
could
be
instilled
from
outside
by
a
vanguard
party
.


In
Main
Currents
of
Marxism
and
his
other
writings
,
he
stated
that
in
order
to
achieve
a
unity
of
theory
and
praxis
,
theory
must
not
only
tend
toward
reality
in
an
attempt
to
change
it
;
reality
must
also
tend
towards
theory
.


Otherwise
,
the
historical
process
leads
a
life
of
its
own
,
while
theorists
make
their
own
little
theories
,
desperately
waiting
for
some
kind
of
possible
influence
over
the
historical
process
.


Henceforth
,
reality
itself
must
tend
toward
the
theory
,
making
it
the
"expression
of
the
revolutionary
process
itself"
.


In
turn
,
a
theory
which
has
as
its
goal
helping
the
proletariat
achieve
class
consciousness
must
first
be
an
"objective
theory
of
class
consciousness"
.


However
,
theory
in
itself
is
insufficient
,
and
ultimately
relies
on
the
struggle
of
humankind
and
of
the
proletariat
for
consciousness
:
the
"objective
theory
of
class
consciousness
is
only
the
theory
of
its
objective
possibility"
.

^([15][16])

Austrian
School
economist
Ludwig
von
Mises
asserted
that
"Marx
confus[ed]
the
notions
of
caste
and
class"
.


Mises
allowed
that
class
consciousness
and
the
associated
class
struggle
were
valid
concepts
in
some
circumstances
where
rigid
social
castes
exist
,
e
.

g
.


,
when
slavery
is
legal
and
slaves
have
a
common
motive
for
wanting
to
end
their
disadvantaged
status
relative
to
other
castes
,
but
that
class
is
an
arbitrary
distinction
in
capitalist
society
where
there
is
equality
before
the
law
.


Mises
believed
that
under
capitalism
,
one
'
s
wealth
does
not
very
much
affect
how
one
is
treated
by
legislators
,
law
enforcement
,
or
the
courts
.

^([17])

Mises
'

follower
Murray
Rothbard
argued
that
Marx
'
s
effort
to
portray
workers
and
capitalists
as
two
monolithic
groups
was
false
because
workers
and
capitalists
routinely
compete
within
themselves
,
such
as
capitalist
entrepreneurs
competing
with
each
other
for
market
dominance
,
or
native
workers
competing
with
immigrant
workers
for
jobs
.


Rothbard
said
that
if
there
is
constant
conflict
among
members
of
the
same
class
(like
,
for
example
,
among
landowners
,
nobility
or
slaveowners)
,
then
it
is
absurd
to
claim
these
landowners
,
nobles
and
slaveowners
can
also
have
shared
objective
interests
with
one
another
against
a
different
class
such
as
their
workers
,
peasants
or
slaves
.

'
Marxism
,
being
a
scientific
theory
,
could
not
be
a
spontaneous

product
of
the
working
class
[according
to
Lenin]
,
but
had
to
be

imported
from
outside
,
by
intellectuals
equipped
with
scientific

knowledge
,
became
the
peculiar
ideological
instrument
to
justify
a

new
idea
of
the
party
of
manipulators
.


Since
the
working
class
is
in

principle
incapable
of
articulating
theoretically
its
consciousness
,

it
is
possible
and
even
necessary
that
the
"genuine"
theoretical

consciousness
of
the
working
class
should
be
incarnated
in
a

political
organism
that
could
consider
itself
the
carrier
of
this

consciousness
regardless
of
what
the
"empirical"
working
class

thought
about
it
,
given
that
the
"empirical"
consciousness
of
this

class
is
irrelevant
in
defining
who
in
a
given
moment
represents
its

interest
.


This
is
why
the
theory
of
class
consciousness
instilled

from
outside
and
the
whole
idea
of
scientific
socialism
so
conceived

served
to
justify
the
fact
that
in
all
kinds
of
political
activity

and
later
in
the
exercise
of
political
power
,
the
working
class
may

be
and
must
be
replaced
by
the
political
apparatus
which
is
the

vehicle
of
its
consciousness
at
the
highest
level
.


The
whole

Leninist
and
then
Stalinist
principle
of
dictatorship
which
the

proletariat
exercises
through
the
intermediary
of
its
self-appointed

representatives
,
is
only
a
development
of
the
idea
of
"scientific

socialism"
so
conceived
.

class
consciousness
,
the
self-understanding
of
members
of
a
social
class
.


This
modern
sociological
concept
has
its
origins
in
,
and
is
closely
associated
with
,
Marxist
theory
.



Although
Karl
Marx
himself
did
not
articulate
a
theory
of
class
consciousness
,
he
intimated
the
concept
in
his
characterization
of
the
working
class
.


According
to
Marx
,
workers
first
become
conscious
of
sharing
common
grievances
against
capitalists
(thus
forming
a
class
“in
itself”)
and
eventually
develop
an
awareness
of
themselves
as
forming
a
social
class
opposed
to
the
bourgeoisie
(thus
becoming
a
class
“for
itself”)
,
the
proletariat
.


Class
consciousness
is
a
historical
phenomenon
,
born
out
of
collective
struggle
.


In
this
sense
,
Marx
did
not
approach
class
consciousness
as
a
matter
of
pure
ideality
.


Rejecting
any
separation
of
theory
and
practice
,
he
used
the
term
“conscious
human
practices”
to
emphasize
the
conjunction
of
subjectivity
and
objectivity
in
history
.



In
his
seminal
study
of
class
consciousness
,
the
Hungarian
Marxist
philosopher
György
Lukács
stressed
the
need
to
distinguish
between
class
consciousness
and
the
ideas
or
feelings
actually
held
by
the
members
of
a
social
class
.


An
objective
analysis
of
class
consciousness
,
according
to
Lukács
,
must
take
into
account
those
thoughts
and
feelings
but
also
those
that
the
members
would
have
held
were
they
able
to
acquire
a
true
picture
of
their
situation
and
of
society
as
a
whole
.



Because
Marxism
considers
social
classes
to
have
objective
identities
and
interests
,
its
conception
of
class
consciousness
includes
the
possibility
of
its
antithesis
:
false
consciousness
.


Broadly
defined
,
false
consciousness
refers
to
a
distorted
understanding
of
one’s
class
identity
and
interest
.


From
the
perspective
of
Marxism
,
it
concerns
primarily
the
tension
between
the
historical
mission
of
the
working
class
(to
destroy
capitalism
and
realize
the
socialist
revolution)
and
its
understanding
thereof
.


The
problem
of
false
consciousness
has
encouraged
an
elitist
streak
in
Marxism
.



Although
false
consciousness
is
an
error
,
it
is
not
baseless
or
purely
fictitious
.


It
is
itself
historically
determined
.


For
Marx
,
capitalism
is
in
a
perpetual
and
eventually
fatal
state
of
crisis
.


Capitalism
unleashes
forces
of
production
that
come
to
undermine
its
own
sustainability
.


For
example
,
capital
accumulation
leads
to
increasing
economic
inequalities
,
which
reduces
the
purchasing
power
of
workers
and
in
turn
diminishes
profit
.


Lukács
suggested
that
the
bourgeoisie
cannot
face
that
crisis
,
because
to
do
so
would
require
accepting
the
end
of
the
class
structure
and
relinquishing
their
class
privilege
.


In
that
sense
,
the
economic
and
political
ideology
of
the
bourgeoisie
is
a
form
of
false
consciousness
,
but
it
is
nonetheless
objectively
determined
by
the
historical
position
of
that
class
.



After
Marx
,
socialist
thinkers
diverged
on
the
status
of
working-class
consciousness
.


Some
were
optimistic
and
considered
the
working
class
to
be
naturally
in
tune
with
its
class
interest
and
spontaneously
revolutionary
;
others
,
like
Lenin
,
argued
that
the
working
class
did
not
possess
instinctual
socialist
tendencies
and
therefore
needed
to
be
enlightened
by
a
revolutionary
vanguard
.



In
a
seminal
redefinition
,
the
sociologist
Michael
Mann
examined
different
dimensions
of
class
consciousness
:
class
belonging
and
identity
,
class
antagonism
,
class
totality
(the
idea
that
social
classes
encompass
the
entirety
of
society)
,
and
the
vision
of
a
classless
society
.


Those
dimensions
not
only
are
formal
subcategories
but
correspond
to
experiences
that
generate
class
awareness
and
class
solidarity
.


For
instance
,
the
experience
of
economic
exploitation
can
lead
workers
to
recognize
that
they
have
a
stake
in
each
other’s
well-being
,
and
from
there
they
will
develop
class
consciousness
and
class
solidarity
.


Mann’s
focus
was
placed
on
consciousness
itself
and
thus
departed
to
some
extent
from
Marx’s
attempt
to
embed
consciousness
in
social
practices
.

Despite
its
Marxist
origin
,
the
concept
of
class
consciousness
is
not
necessarily
predicated
on
a
revolutionary
view
of
history
.


The
sociologist
Karl
Mannheim
,
for
instance
,
associated
social
classes
with
distinct
understandings
of
reality
without
presuming
one
to
be
more
valid
than
others
.


Mannheim
believed
that
social
class
frames
one’s
understanding
of
reality
,
whether
one
is
a
member
of
the
working
class
or
part
of
the
elite
.


The
result
is
a
more
or
less
partial
and
distorted
understanding
,
necessarily
skewed
by
interest
.


Mannheim
thus
identified
class
consciousness
with
ideological
alienation
.


Therefore
,
the
solution
lies
not
in
greater
class
solidarity
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
in
acquiring
a
more-enlightened
understanding
by
approaching
reality
from
a
multiplicity
of
perspectives
.


It
is
important
to
note
that
Marx
and
Mannheim
did
not
consider
all
forms
of
knowledge
to
be
equally
affected
by
class
consciousness
;
they
regarded
mathematics
and
science
to
be
free
of
its
influence
.



The
concept
of
class
consciousness
receded
in
public
discourse
with
the
fall
of
communist
regimes
at
the
end
of
the
20th
century
.


Nevertheless
,
the
idea
continues
to
raise
important
sociological
questions
,
such
as
these
:
What
is
the
relationship
between
economic
condition
and
subjectivity
?


What
is
the
role
of
the
intelligentsia
in
bringing
about
political
change
?


Are
there
collective
forms
of
consciousness
and
,
if
so
,
what
is
their
political
efficacy
?

The
question
is
not
what
goal
is
envisaged
for
the
time
being
by
this
or
that
member
of
the
proletariat
,
or
even
by
the
proletariat
as
a
whole
.


The
question
is
what
is
the
proletariat
and
what
course
of
action
will
it
be
forced
historically
to
take
in
conformity
with
its
own
nature
.


Marx
:
The
Holy
Family
.



------------------------------------------------------------------------

MARX’S
chief
work
breaks
off
just
as
he
is
about
to
embark
on
the
definition
of
class
.


This
omission
was
to
have
serious
consequences
both
for
the
theory
and
the
practice
of
the
proletariat
.


For
on
this
vital
point
the
later
movement
was
forced
to
base
itself
on
interpretations
,
on
the
collation
of
occasional
utterances
by
Marx
and
Engels
and
on
the
independent
extrapolation
and
application
of
their
method
.


In
Marxism
the
division
of
society
into
classes
is
determined
by
position
within
the
process
of
production
.


But
what
,
then
,
is
the
meaning
of
class
consciousness
?


The
question
at
once
branches
out
into
a
series
of
closely
interrelated
problems
.


First
of
all
,
how
are
we
to
understand
class
consciousness
(in
theory)
?


Second
,
what
is
the
(practical)
function
of
class
consciousness
,
so
understood
,
in
the
context
of
the
class
struggle
?


This
leads
to
the
further
question
:
is
the
problem
of
class
consciousness
a
‘general’
sociological
problem
or
does
it
mean
one
thing
for
the
proletariat
and
another
for
every
other
class
to
have
emerged
hitherto
?


And
lastly
,
is
class
consciousness
homogeneous
in
nature
and
function
or
can
we
discern
different
gradations
and
levels
in
it
?


And
if
so
,
what
are
their
practical
implications
for
the
class
struggle
of
the
proletariat
?



1

In
his
celebrated
account
of
historical
materialism
^([1])
Engels
proceeds
from
the
assumption
that
although
the
essence
of
history
consists
in
the
fact
that
“nothing
happens
without
a
conscious
purpose
or
an
intended
aim”
,
to
understand
history
it
is
necessary
to
go
further
than
this
.


For
on
the
one
hand
,
“the
many
individual
wills
active
in
history
for
the
most
part
produce
results
quite
other
than
those
intended
–
often
quite
the
opposite
;
their
motives
,
therefore
,
in
relation
to
the
total
result
are
likewise
of
only
secondary
importance
.


On
the
other
hand
,
the
further
question
arises
:
what
driving
forces
in
turn
stand
behind
these
motives
?


What
are
the
historical
causes
which
transform
themselves
into
these
motives
in
the
brain
of
the
actors
?

”
He
goes
on
to
argue
that
these
driving
forces
ought
themselves
to
be
determined
in
particular
those
which
“set
in
motion
great
masses
,
whole
peoples
and
again
whole
classes
of
the
people
;
and
which
create
.


a
lasting
action
resulting
in
a
great
transformation
.

”
The
essence
of
scientific
Marxism
consists
,
then
,
in
the
realisation
that
the
real
motor
forces
of
history
are
independent
of
man’s
(psychological)
consciousness
of
them
.



At
a
more
primitive
stage
of
knowledge
this
independence
takes
the
form
of
the
belief
that
these
forces
belong
,
as
it
were
,
to
nature
and
that
in
them
and
in
their
causal
interactions
it
is
possible
to
discern
the
‘eternal’
laws
of
nature
.


As
Marx
says
of
bourgeois
thought
:
“Man’s
reflections
on
the
forms
of
social
life
and
consequently
also
his
scientific
analysis
of
those
forms
,
take
a
course
directly
opposite
to
that
of
their
actual
historical
development
.


He
begins
post
festum
with
the
results
of
the
process
of
development
ready
to
hand
before
him
.


The
characters
.


.


.


have
already
acquired
the
stability
of
natural
self-understood
forms
of
social
life
,
before
man
seeks
to
decipher
not
their
historical
character
(for
in
his
eyes
they
are
immutable)
but
their
meaning
.

”
^([2])

This
is
a
dogma
whose
most
important
spokesmen
can
be
found
in
the
political
theory
of
classical
German
philosophy
and
in
the
economic
theory
of
Adam
Smith
and
Ricardo
.


Marx
opposes
to
them
a
critical
philosophy
,
a
theory
of
theory
and
a
consciousness
of
consciousness
.


This
critical
philosophy
implies
above
all
historical
criticism
.


It
dissolves
the
rigid
,
unhistorical
,
natural
appearance
of
social
institutions
;
it
reveals
their
historical
origins
and
shows
therefore
that
they
are
subject
to
history
in
every
-respect
including
historical
decline
.


Consequently
history
does
not
merely
unfold
within
the
terrain
mapped
out
by
these
institutions
.


It
does
not
resolve
itself
into
the
evolution
of
contents
,
of
men
and
situations
,
etc
.


,
while
the
principles
of
society
remain
eternally
valid
.


Nor
are
these
institutions
the
goal
to
which
all
history
aspires
,
such
that
when
they
are
realised
history
will
have
fulfilled
her
mission
and
will
then
be
at
an
end
.


On
the
contrary
,
history
is
precisely
the
history
of
these
institutions
,
of
the
changes
they
undergo
as
institutions
which
bring
men
together
in
societies
.


Such
institutions
start
by
controlling
economic
relations
between
men
and
go
on
to
permeate
all
human
relations
(and
hence
also
man’s
relations
with
himself
and
with
nature
,
etc
.

)
.



At
this
point
bourgeois
thought
must
come
up
against
an
insuperable
obstacle
,
for
its
starting-point
and
its
goal
are
always
,
if
not
always
consciously
,
an
apologia
for
the
existing
order
of
things
or
at
least
the
proof
of
their
immutability
.


^([3])
“Thus
there
has
been
history
,
but
there
is
no
longer
any
,”
^([4])
Marx
observes
with
reference
to
bourgeois
economics
,
a
dictum
which
applies
with
equal
force
to
all
attempts
by
bourgeois
thinkers
to
understand
the
process
of
history
.


(It
has
often
been
pointed
out
that
this
is
also
one
of
the
defects
of
Hegel’s
philosophy
of
history
.

)
As
a
result
,
while
bourgeois
thought
is
indeed
able
to
conceive
of
history
as
a
problem
,
it
remains
an
intractable
problem
.


Either
it
is
forced
to
abolish
the
process
of
history
and
regard
the
institutions
of
the
present
as
eternal
laws
of
nature
which
for
‘mysterious’
reasons
and
in
a
manner
wholly
at
odds
with
the
principles
of
a
rational
science
were
held
to
have
failed
to
establish
themselves
firmly
,
or
indeed
at
all
,
in
the
past
.


(This
is
characteristic
of
bourgeois
sociology
.

)
Or
else
,
everything
meaningful
or
purposive
is
banished
from
history
.


It
then
becomes
impossible
to
advance
beyond
the
mere
‘individuality’
of
the
various
epochs
and
their
social
and
human
representatives
.


History
must
then
insist
with
Ranke
that
every
age
is
“equally
close
to
God”
,
i
.

e
.


has
attained
an
equal
degree
of
perfection
and
that-for
quite
different
reasons-there
is
no
such
thing
as
historical
development
.



In
the
first
case
it
ceases
to
be
possible
to
understand
the
origin
of
social
institutions
.


^([5])
The
objects
of
history
appear
as
the
objects
of
immutable
,
eternal
laws
of
nature
.


History
becomes
fossilised
in
a
formalism
incapable
of
comprehending
that
the
real
nature
of
socio-historical
institutions
is
that
they
consist
of
relations
between
men
.


On
the
contrary
,
men
become
estranged
from
this
,
the
true
source
of
historical
understanding
and
cut
off
from
it
by
an
unbridgeable
gulf
.


As
Marx
points
out
,
^([6])
people
fail
to
realise
“that
these
definite
social
relations
are
just
as
much
the
products
of
men
as
linen
.


flax
,
etc
.

”
.



In
the
second
case
,
history
is
transformed
into
the
irrational
rule
of
blind
forces
which
is
embodied
at
best
in
the
‘spirit
of
the
people’
or
in
‘great
men’
.


It
can
therefore
only
be
described
pragmatically
but
it
cannot
be
rationally
understood
.


Its
only
possible
organisation
would
be
aesthetic
,
as
if
it
were
a
work
of
art
.


Or
else
,
as
in
the
philosophy
of
history
of
the
Kantians
,
it
must
be
seen
as
the
instrument
,
senseless
in
itself
,
by
means
of
which
timeless
,
supra-historical
,
ethical
principles
are
realised
.



Marx
resolves
this
dilemma
by
exposing
it
as
an
illusion
.


The
dilemma
means
only
that
the
contradictions
of
the
capitalist
system
of
production
are
reflected
in
these
mutually
incompatible
accounts
of
the
same
object
.


For
in
this
historiography
with
its
search
for
‘sociological’
laws
or
its
formalistic
rationale
,
we
find
the
reflection
of
man’s
plight
in
bourgeois
society
and
of
his
helpless
enslavement
by
the
forces
of
production
.


“To
them
,
their
own
social
action”
,
Marx
remarks
,
^([7])
“takes
the
form
of
the
action
of
objects
which
rule
the
producers
instead
of
being
ruled
by
them”
.


This
law
was
expressed
most
clearly
and
coherently
in
the
purely
natural
and
rational
laws
of
classical
economics
.


Marx
retorted
with
the
demand
for
a
historical
critique
of
economics
which
resolves
the
totality
of
the
reified
objectivities
of
social
and
economic
life
into
relations
between
men
.


Capital
and
with
it
every
form
in
which
the
national
economy
objectives
itself
is
,
according
to
Marx
,
“not
a
thing
but
a
social
relation
between
persons
mediated
through
things”
.


^([8])

However
,
by
reducing
the
objectivity
of
the
social
institutions
so
hostile
to
man
to
relations
between
men
,
Marx
also
does
away
with
the
false
implications
of
the
irrationalist
and
individualist
principle
,
i
.

e
.


the
other
side
of
the
dilemma
.


For
to
eliminate
the
objectivity
attributed
both
to
social
institutions
inimical
to
man
and
to
their
historical
evolution
means
the
restoration
of
this
objectivity
to
their
underlying
basis
,
to
the
relations
between
men
;
it
does
not
involve
the
elimination
of
laws
and
objectivity
independent
of
the
will
of
man
and
in
particular
the
wills
and
thoughts
of
individual
men
.


It
simply
means
that
this
objectivity
is
the
self-objectification
of
human
society
at
a
particular
stage
in
its
development
;
its
laws
hold
good
only
within
the
framework
of
the
historical
context
which
produced
them
and
which
is
in
turn
determined
by
them
.



It
might
look
as
though
by
dissolving
the
dilemma
in
this
manner
we
were
denying
consciousness
any
decisive
role
in
the
process
of
history
.


It
is
true
that
the
conscious
reflexes
of
the
different
stages
of
economic
growth
remain
historical
facts
of
great
importance
;
it
is
true
that
while
dialectical
materialism
is
itself
the
product
of
this
process
,
it
does
not
deny
that
men
perform
their
historical
deeds
themselves
and
that
they
do
so
consciously
.


But
as
Engels
emphasises
in
a
letter
to
Mehring
,
^([9])
this
consciousness
is
false
.


However
,
the
dialectical
method
does
not
permit
us
simply
to
proclaim
the
‘falseness’
of
this
consciousness
and
to
persist
in
an
inflexible
confrontation
of
true
and
false
.


On
the
contrary
,
it
requires
us
to
investigate
this
‘false
consciousness’
concretely
as
an
aspect
of
the
historical
totality
and
as
a
stage
in
the
historical
process
.



Of
course
bourgeois
historians
also
attempt
such
concrete
analyses
;
indeed
they
reproach
historical
materialists
with
violating
the
concrete
uniqueness
of
historical
events
.


Where
they
go
wrong
is
in
their
belief
that
the
concrete
can
be
located
in
the
empirical
individual
of
history
(’individual’
here
can
refer
to
an
individual
man
,
class
or
people)
and
in
his
empirically
given
(and
hence
psychological
or
mass-psychological)
consciousness
.


And
just
when
they
imagine
that
they
have
discovered
the
most
concrete
thing
of
all
:
society
as
a
concrete
totality
,
the
system
of
production
at
a
given
point
in
history
and
the
resulting
division
of
society
into
classes
–
they
are
in
fact
at
the
furthest
remove
from
it
.


In
missing
the
mark
they
mistake
something
wholly
abstract
for
the
concrete
.


“These
relations
,”
Marx
states
,
“are
not
those
between
one
individual
and
another
,
but
between
worker
and
capitalist
,
tenant
and
landlord
,
etc
.


Eliminate
these
relations
and
you
abolish
the
whole
of
society
;
your
Prometheus
will
then
be
nothing
more
than
a
spectre
without
arms
or
legs
.


.


.


.

”
^([10])

Concrete
analysis
means
then
:
the
relation
to
society
as
a
whole
.


For
only
when
this
relation
is
established
does
the
consciousness
of
their
existence
that
men
have
at
any
given
time
emerge
in
all
its
essential
characteristics
.


It
appears
,
on
the
one
hand
,
as
something
which
is
subjectively
justified
in
the
social
and
historical
situation
,
as
something
which
can
and
should
be
understood
,
i
.

e
.


as
‘right’
.


At
the
same
time
,
objectively
,
it
by-passes
the
essence
of
the
evolution
of
society
and
fails
to
pinpoint
it
and
express
it
adequately
.


That
is
to
say
,
objectively
,
it
appears
as
a
‘false
consciousness’
.


On
the
other
hand
,
we
may
see
the
same
consciousness
as
something
which
fails
subjectively
to
reach
its
self-appointed
goals
,
while
furthering
and
realising
the
objective
aims
of
society
of
which
it
is
ignorant
and
which
it
did
not
choose
.



This
twofold
dialectical
determination
of
‘false
consciousness’
constitutes
an
analysis
far
removed
from
the
naive
description
of
what
men
in
fact
thought
,
felt
and
wanted
at
any
moment
in
history
and
from
any
given
point
in
the
class
structure
.


I
do
not
wish
to
deny
the
great
importance
of
this
,
but
it
remains
after
all
merely
the
material
of
genuine
historical
analysis
.


The
relation
with
concrete
totality
and
the
dialectical
determinants
arising
from
it
transcend
pure
description
and
yield
the
category
of
objective
possibility
.


By
relating
consciousness
to
the
whole
of
society
it
becomes
possible
to
infer
the
thoughts
and
feelings
which
men
would
have
in
a
particular
situation
if
they
were
able
to
assess
both
it
and
the
interests
arising
from
it
in
their
impact
on
immediate
action
and
on
the
whole
structure
of
society
.


That
is
to
say
,
it
would
be
possible
to
infer
the
thoughts
and
feelings
appropriate
to
their
objective
situation
.


The
number
of
such
situations
is
not
unlimited
in
any
society
.


However
much
detailed
researches
are
able
to
refine
social
typologies
there
will
always
be
a
number
of
clearly
distinguished
basic
types
whose
characteristics
are
determined
by
the
types
of
position
available
in
the
process
of
production
.


Now
class
consciousness
consists
in
fact
of
the
appropriate
and
rational
reactions
‘imputed’
[zugerechnet]
to
a
particular
typical
position
in
the
process
of
production
.

^([11])
This
consciousness
is
,
therefore
,
neither
the
sum
nor
the
average
of
what
is
thought
or
felt
by
the
single
individuals
who
make
up
the
class
.


And
yet
the
historically
significant
actions
of
the
class
as
a
whole
are
determined
in
the
last
resort
by
this
consciousness
and
not
by
the
thought
of
the
individual
–
and
these
actions
can
be
understood
only
by
reference
to
this
consciousness
.



This
analysis
establishes
right
from
the
start
the
distance
that
separates
class
consciousness
from
the
empirically
given
,
and
from
the
psychologically
describable
and
explicable
ideas
which
men
form
about
their
situation
in
life
.


But
it
is
not
enough
just
to
state
that
this
distance
exists
or
even
to
define
its
implications
in
a
formal
and
general
way
.


We
must
discover
,
firstly
,
whether
it
is
a
phenomenon
that
differs
according
to
the
manner
in
which
the
various
classes
are
related
to
society
as
a
whole
and
whether
the
differences
are
so
great
as
to
produce
qualitative
distinctions
.


And
we
must
discover
,
secondly
,
the
practical
significance
of
these
different
possible
relations
between
the
objective
economic
totality
,
the
imputed
class
consciousness
and
the
real
,
psychological
thoughts
of
men
about
their
lives
.


We
must
discover
,
in
short
,
the
practical
,
historical
function
of
class
consciousness
.



Only
after
such
preparatory
formulations
can
we
begin
to
exploit
the
category
of
objective
possibility
systematically
.


The
first
question
we
must
ask
is
how
far
is
it
intact
possible
to
discern
the
whole
economy
of
a
society
from
inside
it
?


It
is
essential
to
transcend
the
limitations
of
particular
individuals
caught
up
in
their
own
narrow
prejudices
.


But
it
is
no
less
vital
not
to
overstep
the
frontier
fixed
for
them
by
the
economic
structure
of
society
and
establishing
their
position
in
it
.


^([12])
Regarded
abstractly
and
formally
,
then
,
class
consciousness
implies
a
class-conditioned
unconsciousness
of
ones
own
socio-historical
and
economic
condition
.


^([13])
This
condition
is
given
as
a
definite
structural
relation
,
a
definite
formal
nexus
which
appears
to
govern
the
whole
of
life
.


The
‘falseness’
,
the
illusion
implicit
in
this
situation
is
in
no
sense
arbitrary
;
it
is
simply
the
intellectual
reflex
of
the
objective
economic
structure
.


Thus
,
for
example
,
“the
value
or
price
of
labour-power
takes
on
the
appearance
of
the
price
or
value
of
labour
itself
.


.


.

”
and
“the
illusion
is
created
that
the
totality
is
paid
labour
.


.


.


.


In
contrast
to
that
,
under
slavery
even
that
portion
of
labour
which
is
paid
for
appears
unpaid
for
.

”
^([14])
Now
it
requires
the
most
painstaking
historical
analysis
to
use
the
category
of
objective
possibility
so
as
to
isolate
the
conditions
in
which
this
illusion
can
be
exposed
and
a
real
connection
with
the
totality
established
.


For
if
from
the
vantage
point
of
a
particular
class
the
totality
of
existing
society
is
not
visible
;
if
a
class
thinks
the
thoughts
imputable
to
it
and
which
bear
upon
its
interests
right
through
to
their
logical
conclusion
and
yet
fails
to
strike
at
the
heart
of
that
totality
,
then
such
a
class
is
doomed
to
play
only
a
subordinate
role
.


It
can
never
influence
the
course
of
history
in
either
a
conservative
or
progressive
direction
.


Such
classes
are
normally
condemned
to
passivity
,
to
an
unstable
oscillation
between
the
ruling
and
the
revolutionary
classes
,
and
if
perchance
they
do
erupt
then
such
explosions
are
purely
elemental
and
aimless
.


They
may
win
a
few
battles
but
they
are
doomed
to
ultimate
defeat
.



For
a
class
to
be
ripe
for
hegemony
means
that
its
interests
and
consciousness
enable
it
to
organise
the
whole
of
society
in
accordance
with
those
interests
.


The
crucial
question
in
every
class
struggle
is
this
:
which
class
possesses
this
capacity
and
this
consciousness
at
the
decisive
moment
?


This
does
not
preclude
the
use
of
force
.


It
does
not
mean
that
the
class-interests
destined
to
prevail
and
thus
to
uphold
the
interests
of
society
as
a
whole
can
be
guaranteed
an
automatic
victory
.


On
the
contrary
,
such
a
transfer
of
power
can
often
only
be
brought
about
by
the
most
ruthless
use
of
force
(as
e
.

g
.


the
primitive
accumulation
of
capital)
.


But
it
often
turns
out
that
questions
of
class
consciousness
prove
to
be
decisive
in
just
those
situations
where
force
is
unavoidable
and
where
classes
are
locked
in
a
life-and-death-struggle
.


Thus
the
noted
Hungarian
Marxist
Erwin
Szabo
is
mistaken
in
criticising
Engels
for
maintaining
that
the
Great
Peasant
War
(of
1525)
was
essentially
a
reactionary
movement
.


Szabo
argues
that
the
peasants’
revolt
was
suppressed
only
by
the
ruthless
use
of
force
and
that
its
defeat
was
not
grounded
in
socioeconomic
factors
and
in
the
class
consciousness
of
the
peasants
.


He
overlooks
the
fact
that
the
deepest
reason
for
the
weakness
of
the
peasantry
and
the
superior
strength
of
the
princes
is
to
be
sought
in
class
consciousness
.


Even
the
most
cursory
student
of
the
military
aspects
of
the
Peasants’
War
can
easily
convince
himself
of
this
.



It
must
not
be
thought
,
however
,
that
all
classes
ripe
for
hegemony
have
a
class
consciousness
with
the
same
inner
structure
.


Everything
hinges
on
the
extent
to
which
they
can
become
conscious
of
the
actions
they
need
to
perform
in
order
to
obtain
and
organise
power
.


The
question
then
becomes
:
how
far
does
the
class
concerned
perform
the
actions
history
has
imposed
on
it
‘consciously’
or
‘unconsciously’
?


And
is
that
consciousness
‘true’
or
‘false’
.


These
distinctions
are
by
no
means
academic
.


Quite
apart
from
problems
of
culture
where
such
fissures
and
dissonances
are
crucial
,
in
all
practical
matters
too
the
fate
of
a
class
depends
on
its
ability
to
elucidate
and
solve
the
problems
with
which
history
confronts
it
.


And
here
it
becomes
transparently
obvious
that
class
consciousness
is
concerned
neither
with
the
thoughts
of
individuals
,
however
advanced
,
nor
with
the
state
of
scientific
knowledge
.


For
example
,
it
is
quite
clear
that
ancient
society
was
broken
economically
by
the
limitations
of
a
system
built
on
slavery
.


But
it
is
equally
clear
that
neither
the
ruling
classes
nor
the
classes
that
rebelled
against
them
in
the
name
of
revolution
or
reform
could
perceive
this
.


In
consequence
the
practical
emergence
of
these
problems
meant
that
the
society
was
necessarily
and
irremediably
doomed
.



The
situation
.


is
even
clearer
in
the
case
of
the
modern
bourgeoisie
,
which
,
armed
with
its
knowledge
of
the
workings
of
economics
,
clashed
with
feudal
and
absolutist
society
.


For
the
bourgeoisie
was
quite
unable
to
perfect
its
fundamental
science
,
its
own
science
of
classes
:
the
reef
on
which
it
foundered
was
its
failure
to
discover
even
a
theoretical
solution
to
the
problem
of
crises
.


The
fact
that
a
scientifically
acceptable
solution
does
exist
is
of
no
avail
.


For
to
accept
that
solution
,
even
in
theory
,
would
be
tantamount
to
observing
society
from
a
class
standpoint
other
than
that
of
the
bourgeoisie
.


And
no
class
can
do
that
–
unless
it
is
willing
to
abdicate
its
power
freely
.


Thus
the
barrier
which
converts
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
into
‘false’
consciousness
is
objective
;
it
is
the
class
situation
itself
.


It
is
the
objective
result
of
the
economic
set-up
,
and
is
neither
arbitrary
,
subjective
nor
psychological
.


The
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
may
well
be
able
to
reflect
all
the
problems
of
organisation
entailed
by
its
hegemony
and
by
the
capitalist
transformation
and
penetration
of
total
production
.


But
it
becomes
obscured
as
soon
as
it
is
called
upon
to
face
problems
that
remain
within
its
jurisdiction
but
which
point
beyond
the
limits
of
capitalism
.


The
discovery
of
the
(natural
laws’
of
economics
is
pure
light
in
comparison
with
medieval
feudalism
or
even
the
mercantilism
of
the
transitional
period
,
but
by
an
internal
dialectical
twist
they
became
“natural
laws
based
on
the
unconsciousness
of
those
who
are
involved
in
them”
.


^([15])

It
would
be
beyond
the
scope
of
these
pages
to
advance
further
and
attempt
to
construct
a
historical
and
systematic
typology
of
the
possible
degrees
of
class
consciousness
.


That
would
require
–
in
the
first
instance
–
an
exact
study
of
the
point
in
the
total
process
of
production
at
which
the
interests
of
the
various
classes
are
most
immediately
and
vitally
involved
.


Secondly
,
we
would
have
to
show
how
far
it
would
be
in
the
interest
of
any
given
class
to
go
beyond
this
immediacy
,
to
annul
and
transcend
its
immediate
interest
by
seeing
it
as
a
factor
within
a
totality
.


And
lastly
,
what
is
the
nature
of
the
totality
that
is
then
achieved
?


How
far
does
it
really
embrace
the
true
totality
of
production
?


It
is
quite
evident
that
the
quality
and
structure
of
class
consciousness
must
be
very
different
if
,
e
.

g
.


it
remains
stationary
at
the
separation
of
consumption
from
production
(as
with
the
Roman
Lumpenproletariat)
or
if
it
represents
the
formation
of
the
interests
of
circulation
(as
with
merchant
capital)
.


Although
we
cannot
embark
on
a
systematic
typology
of
the
various
points
of
view
it
can
be
seen
from
the
foregoing
that
these
specimens
of
‘false’
consciousness
differ
from
each
other
both
qualitatively
,
structurally
and
in
a
manner
that
is
crucial
for
the
activity
of
the
classes
in
society
.

It
follows
from
the
above
that
for
pre-capitalist
epochs
and
for
the
behaviour
of
many
strata
within
capitalism
whose
economic
roots
lie
in
pre-capitalism
,
class
consciousness
is
unable
to
achieve
complete
clarity
and
to
influence
the
course
of
history
consciously
.



This
is
true
above
all
because
class
interests
in
pre-capitalist
society
never
achieve
full
(economic)
articulation
.


Hence
the
structuring
of
society
into
castes
and
estates
means
that
economic
elements
are
inextricably
joined
to
political
and
religious
factors
.


In
contrast
to
this
,
the
rule
of
the
bourgeoisie
means
the
abolition
of
the
estates-system
and
this
leads
to
the
organisation
of
society
along
class
lines
.


(In
many
countries
vestiges
of
the
feudal
system
still
survive
,
but
this
does
not
detract
from
the
validity
of
this
observation
.

)

This
situation
has
its
roots
in
the
profound
difference
between
capitalist
and
pre-capitalist
economics
.


The
most
striking
distinction
,
and
the
one
that
directly
concerns
us
,
is
that
pre-capitalist
societies
are
much
less
cohesive
than
capitalism
.


The
various
parts
are
much
more
self-sufficient
and
less
closely
interrelated
than
in
capitalism
.


Commerce
plays
a
smaller
role
in
society
,
the
various
sectors
were
more
autonomous
(as
in
the
case
of
village
communes)
or
else
plays
no
part
at
all
in
the
economic
life
of
the
community
and
in
the
process
of
production
(as
was
true
of
large
numbers
of
citizens
in
Greece
and
Rome)
.


In
such
circumstances
the
state
,
i
.

e
.


the
organised
unity
,
remains
insecurely
anchored
in
the
real
life
of
society
.


One
sector
of
society
simply
lives
out
its
‘natural’
existence
in
what
amounts
to
a
total
independence
of
the
fate
of
the
state
.


“The
simplicity
of
the
organisation
for
production
in
these
self-sufficient
communities
that
constantly
reproduce
themselves
in
the
same
form
,
and
when
accidentally
destroyed
,
spring
up
again
on
the
spot
and
with
the
same
name
–
this
simplicity
supplies
the
key
to
the
secret
of
the
immutability
of
Asiatic
societies
,
an
immutability
in
such
striking
contrast
with
the
constant
dissolution
and
resounding
of
Asiatic
states
,
and
the
never-ceasing
changes
of
dynasty
.


The
structure
of
the
economic
elements
of
society
remains
untouched
by
the
storm-clouds
of
the
political
sky
.

”
^([16])

Yet
another
sector
of
society
is
–
economically
–
completely
parasitic
.


For
this
sector
the
state
with
its
power
apparatus
is
not
,
as
it
is
for
the
ruling
classes
under
capitalism
,
a
means
whereby
to
put
into
practice
the
principles
of
its
economic
power
–
if
need
be
with
the
aid
of
force
.


Nor
is
it
the
instrument
it
uses
to
create
the
conditions
for
its
economic
dominance
(as
with
modern
colonialism)
.


That
is
to
say
,
the
state
is
not
a
mediation
of
the
economic
control
of
society
:
it
is
that
unmediated
dominance
itself
.


This
is
true
not
merely
in
cases
of
the
straightforward
theft
of
land
or
slaves
,
but
also
in
so-called
peaceful
economic
relations
.


Thus
in
connection
with
labour-rent
Marx
says
:
“Under
such
circumstances
the
surplus
labour
can
be
extorted
from
them
for
the
benefit
of
the
nominal
landowner
only
by
other
than
economic
pressure
.

”
In
Asia
“rent
and
taxes
coincide
,
or
rather
there
is
no
tax
other
than
this
form
of
ground-rent”
.


^([17])

Even
commerce
is
not
able
,
in
the
forms
it
assumes
in
pre-capitalist
societies
,
to
make
decisive
inroads
on
the
basic
structure
of
society
.


Its
impact
remains
superficial
and
the
process
of
production
above
all
in
relation
to
labour
,
remains
beyond
its
control
.


“A
merchant
could
buy
every
commodity
,
but
labour
as
a
commodity
he
could
not
buy
.


He
existed
only
on
sufferance
,
as
a
dealer
in
the
products
of
the
handicrafts
.

”
^([18])

Despite
all
this
,
every
such
society
constitutes
an
economic
unity
.


The
only
question
that
arises
is
whether
this
unity
enables
the
individual
sectors
of
society
to
relate
to
society
as
a
whole
in
such
a
way
that
their
imputed
consciousness
can
assume
an
economic
form
.


Marx
emphasises
^([19])
that
in
Greece
and
Rome
the
class
struggle
“chiefly
took
the
form
of
a
conflict
between
debtors
and
creditors”
.


But
he
also
makes
the
further
,
very
valid
point
:
“Nevertheless
,
the
money-relationship
–
and
the
relationship
of
creditor
to
debtor
is
one
of
money
–
reflects
only
the
deeper-lying
antagonism
between
the
economic
conditions
of
existence
.

”
Historical
materialism
showed
that
this
reflection
was
no
more
than
a
reflection
,
but
we
must
go
on
to
ask
:
was
it
at
all
possible
–
objectively
–
for
the
classes
in
such
a
society
to
become
conscious
of
the
economic
basis
of
these
conflicts
and
of
the
economic
problems
with
which
the
society
was
afflicted
?


Was
it
not
inevitable
that
these
conflicts
and
problems
should
assume
either
natural
‘
religious
forms’
^([20])
or
else
political
and
legal
ones
,
depending
on
circumstances
?



The
division
of
society
into
estates
or
castes
means
in
effect
that
conceptually
and
organisationally
these
‘natural’
forms
are
established
without
their
economic
basis
ever
becoming
conscious
.


It
means
that
there
is
no
mediation
between
the
pure
traditionalism
of
natural
growth
and
the
legal
institutions
it
assumes
.


^([21])
In
accordance
with
the
looser
economic
structure
of
society
,
the
political
and
legal
institutions
(here
the
division
into
estates
,
privileges
,
etc
.

)
,
have
different
functions
objectively
and
subjectively
from
those
exercised
under
capitalism
.


In
capitalism
these
institutions
merely
imply
the
stabilisation
of
purely
economic
forces
so
that
–
as
Karner
has
ably
demonstrated
^([22])
–
they
frequently
adapt
themselves
to
changed
economic
structures
without
changing
themselves
in
form
or
content
.


By
contrast
,
in
pre-capitalist
societies
legal
institutions
intervene
substantively
in
the
interplay
of
economic
forces
.


In
fact
there
are
no
purely
economic
categories
to
appear
or
to
be
given
legal
form
(and
according
to
Marx
,
economic
categories
are
“forms
of
existence
,
determinations
of
life”)
.


^([23])
Economic
and
legal
categories
are
objectively
and
substantively
so
interwoven
as
to
be
inseparable
.


(Consider
here
the
instances
cited
earlier
of
labour-rent
,
and
taxes
,
of
slavery
,
etc
.

)
In
Hegel’s
parlance
the
economy
has
not
even
objectively
reached
the
stage
of
being-for-itself
.


There
is
therefore
no
possible
position
within
such
a
society
from
which
the
economic
basis
of
all
social
relations
could
be
made
conscious
.



This
is
not
of
course
to
deny
the
objective
economic
foundations
of
social
institutions
.


On
the
contrary
,
the
history
of
[feudal]
estates
shows
very
clearly
that
what
in
origin
had
been
a
‘natural’
economic
existence
cast
into
stable
forms
begins
gradually
to
disintegrate
as
a
result
of
subterranean
,
‘unconscious’
economic
development
.


That
is
to
say
,
it
ceases
to
be
a
real
unity
.


Their
economic
content
destroys
the
unity
of
their
juridical
form
.


(Ample
proof
of
this
is
furnished
both
by
Engels
in
his
analysis
of
the
class
struggles
of
the
Reformation
.


period
and
by
Cunow
in
his
discussion
of
the
French
Revolution
.

)
However
,
despite
this
conflict
between
juridical
form
and
economic
content
,
the
juridical
(privilege-creating)
forms
retain
a
great
and
often
absolutely
crucial
importance
for
the
consciousness
of
estates
in
the
process
of
disintegration
.


For
the
form
of
the
estates
conceals
the
connection
between
the
–
real
but
‘unconscious’
–
economic
existence
of
the
estate
and
the
economic
totality
of
society
.


It
fixates
consciousness
directly
on
its
privileges
(as
in
the
case
of
the
knights
during
the
Reformation)
or
else
–
no
less
directly
–
on
the
particular
element
of
society
from
which
the
privileges
emanated
(as
in
the
case
of
the
guilds)
.



Even
when
an
estate
has
disintegrated
,
even
when
its
members
have
been
absorbed
economically
into
a
number
of
different
classes
,
it
still
retains
this
(objectively
unreal)
ideological
coherence
.


For
the
relation
to
the
whole
created
by
the
consciousness
of
one’s
status
is
not
directed
to
the
real
,
living
economic
unity
but
to
a
past
state
of
society
as
constituted
by
the
privileges
accorded
to
the
estates
.


Status
–
consciousness
–
a
real
historical
factor
masks
class
consciousness
;
in
fact
it
prevents
it
from
emerging
at
all
.


A
like
phenomenon
can
be
observed
under
capitalism
in
the
case
of
all
‘privileged’
groups
whose
class
situation
lacks
any
immediate
economic
base
.


The
ability
of
such
a
class
to
adapt
itself
to
the
real
economic
development
can
be
measured
by
the
extent
to
which
it
succeeds
in
‘capitalising’
itself
,
i
.

e
.


transforming
its
privileges
into
economic
and
capitalist
forms
of
control
(as
was
the
case
with
the
great
landowners)
.



Thus
class
consciousness
has
quite
a
different
relation
to
history
in
pre-capitalist
and
capitalist
periods
.


In
the
former
case
the
classes
could
only
be
deduced
from
the
immediately
given
historical
reality
by
the
methods
of
historical
materialism
.


In
capitalism
they
themselves
constitute
this
immediately
given
historical
reality
.


It
is
therefore
no
accident
that
(as
Engels
too
has
pointed
out)
this
knowledge
of
history
only
became
possible
with
the
advent
of
capitalism
.


Not
only
–
as
Engels
believed
–
because
of
the
greater
simplicity
of
capitalism
in
contrast
to
the
‘complex
and
concealed
relations’
of
earlier
ages
.


But
primarily
because
only
with
capitalism
does
economic
class
interest
emerge
in
all
its
starkness
as
the
motor
of
history
.


In
pre-capitalist
periods
man
could
never
become
conscious
(not
even
by
virtue
of
an
‘imputed’
consciousness)
of
the
“true
driving
forces
which
stand
behind
the
motives
of
human
actions
in
history”
.


They
remained
hidden
behind
motives
and
were
in
truth
the
blind
forces
of
history
.


Ideological
factors
do
not
merely
‘mask’
economic
interests
,
they
are
not
merely
the
banners
and
slogans
:
they
are
the
parts
,
the
components
of
which
the
real
struggle
is
made
.


Of
course
,
if
historical
materialism
is
deployed
to
discover
the
sociological
meaning
of
these
struggles
,
economic
interests
will
doubtless
be
revealed
as
the
decisive
factors
in
any
explanation
.



But
there
is
still
an
unbridgeable
gulf
between
this
and
capitalism
where
economic
factors
are
not
concealed
‘behind’
consciousness
but
are
present
in
consciousness
itself
(albeit
unconsciously
or
repressed)
.


With
capitalism
,
with
the
abolition
of
the
feudal
estates
and
with
the
creation
of
a
society
with
a
purely
economic
articulation
,
class
consciousness
arrived
at
the
point
where
it
could
become
conscious
.


From
then
on
social
conflict
was
reflected
in
an
ideological
struggle
for
consciousness
and
for
the
veiling
or
the
exposure
of
the
class
character
of
society
.


But
the
fact
that
this
conflict
became
possible
points
forward
to
the
dialectical
contradictions
and
the
internal
dissolution
of
pure
class
society
.


In
Hegel’s
words
,
“When
philosophy
paints
its
gloomy
picture
a
form
of
life
has
grown
old
.


It
cannot
be
rejuvenated
by
the
gloomy
picture
,
but
only
understood
.


Only
when
dusk
starts
to
fall
does
the
owl
of
Minerva
spread
its
wings
and
fly
.

"

Bourgeoisie
and
proletariat
are
the
only
pure
classes
in
bourgeois
society
.


They
are
the
only
classes
whose
existence
and
development
are
entirely
dependent
on
the
course
taken
by
the
modern
evolution
of
production
and
only
from
the
vantage
point
of
these
classes
can
a
plan
for
the
total
organisation
of
society
even
be
imagined
.


The
outlook
of
the
other
classes
(petty
bourgeois
or
peasants)
is
ambiguous
or
sterile
because
their
existence
is
not
based
exclusively
on
their
role
in
the
capitalist
system
of
production
but
is
indissolubly
linked
with
the
vestiges
of
feudal
society
.


Their
aim
,
therefore
,
is
not
to
advance
capitalism
or
to
transcend
it
,
but
to
reverse
its
action
or
at
least
to
prevent
it
from
developing
fully
.


Their
class
interest
concentrates
on
symptoms
of
development
and
not
on
development
itself
,
and
on
elements
of
society
rather
than
on
the
construction
of
society
as
a
whole
.



The
question
of
consciousness
may
make
its
appearance
in
terms
of
the
objectives
chosen
or
in
terms
of
action
,
as
for
instance
in
the
case
of
the
petty
bourgeoisie
.


This
class
lives
at
least
in
part
in
the
capitalist
big
city
and
every
aspect
of
its
existence
is
directly
exposed
to
the
influence
of
capitalism
.


Hence
it
cannot
possibly
remain
wholly
unaffected
by
the
fact
of
class
conflict
between
bourgeoisie
and
proletariat
.


But
as
a
“transitional
class
in
which
the
interests
of
two
other
classes
become
simultaneously
blunted
.


.


.

”
it
will
imagine
itself
“to
be
above
all
class
antagonisms”
.


^([24])
Accordingly
it
will
search
for
ways
whereby
it
will
“not
indeed
eliminate
the
two
extremes
of
capital
and
wage
labour
,
but
will
weaken
their
antagonism
and
transform
it
into
harmony”
.


^([25])
In
all
decisions
crucial
for
society
its
actions
will
be
irrelevant
and
it
will
be
forced
to
fight
for
both
sides
in
turn
but
always
without
consciousness
.


In
so
doing
its
own
objectives
–
which
exist
exclusively
in
its
own
consciousness
–
must
become
progressively
weakened
and
increasingly
divorced
from
social
action
.


Ultimately
they
will
assume
purely
‘ideological’
forms
The
petty
bourgeoisie
will
only
be
able
to
play
an
active
role
in
history
as
long
as
these
objectives
happen
to
coincide
with
the
real
economic
interests
of
capitalism
.


This
was
the
case
with
the
abolition
of
the
feudal
estates
during
the
French
Revolution
.


With
the
fulfilment
of
this
mission
its
utterances
,
which
for
the
most
part
remain
unchanged
in
form
,
become
more
and
more
remote
from
real
events
and
turn
finally
into
mere
caricatures
(this
was
true
,
e
.

g
.


of
the
Jacobinism
of
the
Montagne
1848-51)
.



This
isolation
from
society
as
a
whole
has
its
repercussions
on
the
internal
structure
of
the
class
and
its
organisational
potential
.


This
can
be
seen
most
clearly
in
the
development
of
the
peasantry
.


Marx
says
on
this
point
:
^([26])
“The
small-holding
peasants
form
a
vast
mass
whose
members
live
in
similar
conditions
but
without
entering
into
manifold
relations
with
each
other
.


Their
mode
of
production
isolates
them
from
one
another
instead
of
bringing
them
into
mutual
intercourse
.


.


.


.


Every
single
peasant
family
.


.


.


thus
acquires
its
means
of
life
more
through
exchange
with
nature
than
in
intercourse
with
society
.


.


.


.


In
so
far
as
millions
of
families
live
under
economic
conditions
of
existence
that
separate
their
mode
of
life
,
their
interests
and
their
culture
from
those
of
other
classes
and
place
them
in
opposition
to
them
,
they
constitute
a
class
.


In
so
far
as
there
is
only
a
local
connection
between
the
smallholding
peasants
,
and
the
identity
of
their
interests
begets
no
community
,
no
national
unity
and
no
political
organisation
,
they
do
not
constitute
a
class
.

”
Hence
external
upheavals
,
such
as
war
,
revolution
in
the
towns
,
etc
.


are
needed
before
these
,
masses
can
coalesce
in
a
unified
movement
,
and
even
then
they
are
incapable
of
organising
it
and
supplying
it
with
slogans
and
a
positive
direction
corresponding
to
their
own
interests
.



Whether
these
movements
will
be
progressive
(as
in
the
French
Revolution
of
1789
or
the
Russian
Revolution
of
1917)
,
or
reactionary
(as
with
Napoleon’s
coup
d’état)
will
depend
on
the
position
of
the
other
classes
involved
in
the
conflict
,
and
on
the
level
of
consciousness
of
the
parties
that
lead
them
.


For
this
reason
,
too
,
the
ideological
form
taken
by
the
class
consciousness
of
the
peasants
changes
its
content
more
frequently
than
that
of
other
classes
:
this
is
because
it
is
always
borrowed
from
elsewhere
.



Hence
parties
that
base
themselves
wholly
or
in
part
on
this
class
consciousness
always
lack
really
firm
and
secure
support
in
critical
situations
(as
was
true
of
the
Socialist
Revolutionaries
in
1917
and
1918)
.


This
explains
why
it
is
possible
for
peasant
conflicts
to
be
fought
out
under
opposing
flags
.


Thus
it
is
highly
characteristic
of
both
Anarchism
and
the
‘class
consciousness
of
the
peasantry
that
a
number
of
counter-revolutionary
rebellions
and
uprisings
of
the
middle
and
upper
strata
of
the
peasantry
in
Russia
should
have
found
the
anarchist
view
of
society
to
be
a
satisfying
ideology
.


We
cannot
really
speak
of
class
consciousness
in
the
case
of
these
classes
(if
,
indeed
,
we
can
,
even
speak
of
them
as
classes
in
the
strict
Marxist
sense
of
the
term)
:
for
a
full
consciousness
of
their
situation
would
reveal
to
them
the
hopelessness
of
their
particularise
strivings
in
the
face
of
the
inevitable
course
of
events
.


Consciousness
and
self-interest
then
are
mutually
incompatible
in
this
instance
.


And
as
class
consciousness
was
defined
in
terms
of
the
problems
of
imputing
class
interests
the
failure
of
their
class
consciousness
to
develop
in
the
immediately
given
historical
reality
becomes
comprehensible
philosophically
.



With
the
bourgeoisie
,
also
,
class
consciousness
stands
in
opposition
to
class
interest
.


But
here
the
antagonism
is
not
contradictory
but
dialectical
.



The
distinction
between
the
two
modes
of
contradiction
may
be
briefly
described
in
this
way
:
in
the
case
of
the
other
classes
,
a
class
consciousness
is
prevented
from
emerging
by
their
position
within
the
process
of
production
and
the
interests
this
generates
.


In
the
case
of
the
bourgeoisie
,
however
,
these
factors
combine
to
produce
a
class
consciousness
but
one
which
is
cursed
by
its
very
nature
with
the
tragic
fate
of
developing
an
insoluble
contradiction
at
the
very
zenith
of
its
powers
.


As
a
result
of
this
contradiction
it
must
annihilate
itself
.



The
tragedy
of
the
bourgeoisie
is
reflected
historically
in
the
fact
that
even
before
it
had
defeated
its
predecessor
,
feudalism
,
its
new
enemy
,
the
proletariat
,
had
appeared
on
the
scene
.


Politically
,
it
became
evident
when
,
at
the
moment
of
victory
,
the
‘freedom’
in
whose
name
the
bourgeoisie
had
joined
battle
wit
i
feudalism
,
was
transformed
into
a
new
repressiveness
.


Sociologically
,
the
bourgeoisie
did
everything
in
its
power
to
eradicate
the
fact
of
class
conflict
from
the
consciousness
of
society
,
even
though
class
conflict
had
only
emerged
in
its
purity
and
became
established
as
an
historical
fact
with
the
advent
of
capitalism
.


Ideologically
,
we
see
the
same
contradiction
in
the
fact
that
the
bourgeoisie
endowed
the
individual
with
an
unprecedented
importance
,
but
at
the
same
time
that
same
individuality
was
annihilated
by
the
economic
conditions
to
which
it
was
subjected
,
by
the
reification
created
by
commodity
production
.



All
these
contradictions
,
and
the
list
might
be
extended
indefinitely
,
are
only
the
reflection
of
the
deepest
contradictions
in
capitalism
itself
as
they
appear
in
the
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
in
accordance
with
their
position
in
the
total
system
of
production
.


For
this
reason
they
appear
as
dialectical
contradictions
in
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
.


They
do
not
merely
reflect
the
inability
of
the
bourgeoisie
to
grasp
the
contradictions
inherent
in
its
own
social
order
.


For
,
on
the
one
hand
,
capitalism
is
the
first
system
of
production
able
to
achieve
a
total
economic
penetration
of
society
,
^([27])
and
this
implies
that
in
theory
the
bourgeoisie
should
be
able
to
progress
from
this
central
point
to
the
possession
of
an
(imputed)
class
consciousness
of
the
whole
system
of
production
.


On
the
other
hand
,
the
position
held
by
the
capitalist
class
and
the
interests
which
determine
its
actions
ensure
that
it
will
be
unable
to
control
its
own
system
of
production
even
in
theory
.



There
are
many
reasons
for
this
.


In
the
first
place
,
it
only
seems
to
be
true
that
for
capitalism
production
occupies
the
centre
of
class
consciousness
and
hence
provides
the
theoretical
starting-point
for
analysis
.


With
reference
to
Ricardo
“who
had
been
reproached
with
an
exclusive
concern
with
production”
,
Marx
emphasised
^([28])
that
he
“defined
distribution
as
the
sole
subject
of
economics”
.


And
the
detailed
analysis
of
the
process
by
which
capital
is
concretely
realised
shows
in
every
single
instance
that
the
interest
of
the
capitalist
(who
produces
not
goods
but
commodities)
is
necessarily
confined
to
matters
that
must
be
peripheral
in
terms
of
production
.


Moreover
,
the
capitalist
,
enmeshed
in
what
is
for
him
the
decisive
process
of
the
expansion
of
capital
must
have
a
standpoint
from
which
the
most
important
problems
become
quite
invisible
.


^([29])

The
discrepancies
that
result
are
further
exacerbated
by
the
fact
that
there
is
an
insoluble
contradiction
running
through
the
internal
structure
of
capitalism
between
the
social
and
the
individual
principle
,
i
.

e
.


between
the
function
of
capital
as
private
property
and
its
objective
economic
function
.


As
the
Communist
Manifesto
states
:
“Capital
is
a
social
force
and
not
a
personal
one
.

”
But
it
is
a
social
force
whose
movements
are
determined
by
the
individual
interests
of
the
owners
of
capital
–
who
cannot
see
and
who
are
necessarily
indifferent
to
all
the
social
implications
of
their
activities
.


Hence
the
social
principle
and
the
social
function
implicit
in
capital
can
only
prevail
unbeknown
to
them
and
,
as
it
were
,
against
their
will
and
behind
their
backs
.


Because
of
this
conflict
between
the
individual
and
the
social
,
Marx
rightly
characterised
the
stock
companies
as
the
“negation
,
of
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
itself”
.


^([30])
Of
course
,
it
is
true
that
stock
companies
differ
only
in
inessentials
from
individual
capitalists
and
even
the
so-called
abolition
of
the
anarchy
in
production
through
cartels
and
trusts
only
shifts
the
contradiction
elsewhere
,
without
,
however
,
eliminating
it
.


This
situation
forms
one
of
the
decisive
factors
governing
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
.


It
is
true
that
the
bourgeoisie
acts
as
a
class
in
the
objective
evolution
of
society
.


But
it
understands
the
process
(which
it
is
itself
instigating)
as
something
external
which
is
subject
to
objective
laws
which
it
can
only
experience
passively
.



Bourgeois
thought
observes
economic
life
consistently
and
necessarily
from
the
standpoint
of
the
individual
capitalist
and
this
naturally
produces
a
sharp
confrontation
between
the
individual
and
the
overpowering
supra-personal
‘law
of
nature’
which
propels
all
social
phenomena
.


^([31])
This
leads
both
to
the
antagonism
between
individual
and
class
interests
in
the
event
of
conflict
(which
,
it
is
true
,
rarely
becomes
as
acute
among
the
.


ruling
classes
as
in
the
bourgeoisie)
,
and
also
to
the
logical
impossibility
of
discovering
theoretical
and
practical
solutions
to
the
problems
created
by
the
capitalist
system
of
production
.



"This
sudden
reversion
from
a
system
of
credit
to
a
system
of
hard
cash
heaps
theoretical
fright
on
top
of
practical
panic
;
and
the
dealers
by
whose
agency
circulation
is
effected
shudder
before
the
impenetrable
mystery
in
which
their
own
economic
relations
are
shrouded
.

”
^([32])
This
terror
is
not
unfounded
,
.


that
is
to
say
,
it
is
much
more
than
the
bafflement
felt
by
the
individual
capitalist
when
confronted
by
his
own
individual
fate
.


The
facts
and
the
situations
which
induce
this
panic
force
something
into
the
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
which
is
too
much
of
a
brute
fact
for
its
existence
to
be
wholly
denied
or
repressed
.


But
equally
it
is
something
that
the
bourgeoisie
can
never
fully
understand
.


For
the
recognisable
background
to
this
situation
is
the
fact
that
“the
real
barrier
of
capitalist
production
is
capital
itself”
.


^([33])
And
if
this
insight
were
to
become
conscious
it
would
indeed
entail
the
self-negation
of
the
capitalist
class
.



In
this
way
the
objective
limits
of
capitalist
production
become
the
limits
of
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
.


The
older
‘natural’
and
‘conservative’
forms
of
domination
had
left
unmolested
^([34])
the
forms
of
production
of
whole
sections
of
the
people
they
ruled
and
therefore
exerted
by
and
large
a
traditional
and
unrevolutionary
influence
.


Capitalism
,
by
contrast
,
is
a
revolutionary
form
par
excellence
.


The
fact
that
it
must
necessarily
remain
in
ignorance
of
the
objective
economic
limitations
of
its
own
system
expresses
itself
as
an
internal
,
dialectical
contradiction
in
its
class
consciousness

This
means
that
formally
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
is
geared
to
economic
consciousness
.


And
indeed
the
highest
degree
of
unconsciousness
,
the
crassest
,
form
of
‘false
consciousness’
always
manifests
itself
when
the
conscious
mastery
of
economic
phenomena
appears
to
be
at
its
greatest
.


From
the
point
of
view
of
the
relation
of
consciousness
to
society
this
contradiction
is
expressed
as
the
irreconcilable
antagonism
between
ideology
and
economic
base
.


Its
dialectics
are
grounded
in
the
irreconcilable
antagonism
between
the
(capitalist)
individual
,
i
.

e
.


the
stereotyped
individual
of
capitalism
,
and
the
‘natural’
and
inevitable
process
of
development
,
i
.

e
.


the
process
not
subject
to
consciousness
.


In
consequence
theory
and
practice
are
brought
into
irreconcilable
opposition
to
each
other
.


But
the
resulting
dualism
is
anything
but
stable
;
in
fact
it
constantly
strives
to
harmonise
principles
that
have
been
wrenched
apart
and
thenceforth
oscillate
between
a
new
‘false’
synthesis
and
its
subsequent
cataclysmic
disruption
.



This
internal
dialectical
contradiction
in
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
is
further
aggravated
by
the
fact
that
the
objective
limits
of
capitalism
do
not
remain
purely
negative
.


That
is
to
say
that
capitalism
does
not
merely
set
‘natural’
laws
in
motion
that
provoke
crises
which
it
cannot
comprehend
.


On
the
contrary
,
those
limits
acquire
a
historical
embodiment
with
its
own
consciousness
and
its
own
actions
:
the
proletariat
.



Most
‘normal’
shifts
of
perspective
produced
by
the
capitalist
point
of
view
in
the
image
of
the
economic
structure
of
society
tend
to
“obscure
and
mystify
the
true
origin
of
surplus
value”
.


^([35])
In
the
‘normal’
,
purely
theoretical
view
this
mystification
only
attaches
to
the
organic
composition
of
capital
,
viz
.


to
the
place
of
the
employer
in
the
productive
system
and
the
economic
function
of
interest
etc
.


,
i
.

e
.


it
does
no
more
than
highlight
the
failure
of
observers
to
perceive
the
true
driving
forces
that
lie
beneath
the
surface
.


But
when
it
comes
to
practice
this
mystification
touches
upon
the
central
fact
of
capitalist
society
:
the
class
struggle
.



In
the
class
struggle
we
witness
the
emergence
of
all
the
hidden
forces
that
usually
lie
concealed
behind
the
façade
of
economic
life
,
at
which
the
capitalists
and
their
apologists
gaze
as
though
transfixed
.


These
forces
appear
in
such
a
way
that
they
cannot
possibly
be
ignored
.


So
much
so
that
even
when
capitalism
was
in
the
ascendant
and
the
proletariat
could
only
give
vent
to
its
protests
in
the
form
of
vehement
spontaneous
explosions
,
even
the
ideological
exponents
of
the
rising
bourgeoisie
acknowledged
the
class
struggle
as
a
basic
fact
of
history
.


(For
example
,
Marat
and
later
historians
such
as
Mignet
.

)
But
in
proportion
as
the
theory
and
practice
of
the
proletariat
made
society
conscious
of
this
unconscious
,
revolutionary
principle
inherent
in
capitalism
,
the
bourgeoisie
was
thrown
back
increasingly
on
to
a
conscious
defensive
.


The
dialectical
contradiction
in
the
‘false’
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
became
more
and
more
acute
:
the
‘false’
consciousness
was
converted
into
a
mendacious
consciousness
.


What
had
been
at
first
an
objective
contradiction
now
became
subjective
also
:
the
theoretical
problem
turned
into
a
moral
posture
which
decisively
influenced
every
practical
class
attitude
in
every
situation
and
on
every
issue
.



Thus
the
situation
in
which
the
bourgeoisie
finds
itself
determines
the
function
of
its
class
consciousness
in
its
struggle
to
achieve
control
of
society
.


The
hegemony
of
the
bourgeoisie
really
does
embrace
the
whole
of
society
;
it
really
does
attempt
to
organise
the
whole
of
society
in
its
own
interests
(and
in
this
it
has
had
some
success)
.


To
achieve
this
it’
was
forced
both
to
develop
a
coherent
theory
of
economics
,
politics
and
society
(which
in
itself
presupposes
and
amounts
to
a
‘Weltanschauung’)
,
and
also
to
make
conscious
and
sustain
its
faith
in
its
own
mission
to
control
and
organise
society
.


The
tragic
dialectics
of
the
bourgeoisie
can
be
seen
in
the
fact
that
it
is
not
only
desirable
but
essential
for
it
to
clarify
its
own
class
interests
on
every
particular
issue
,
while
at
the
same
time
such
a
clear
awareness
becomes
fatal
when
it
is
extended
to
the
question
of
the
totality
.


The
chief
reason
for
this
is
that
the
rule
of
the
bourgeoisie
can
only
be
the
rule
of
a
minority
.


Its
hegemony
is
exercised
not
merely
by
a
minority
but
in
the
interest
of
that
minority
,
so
the
need
to
deceive
the
other
classes
and
to
ensure
that
their
class
consciousness
remains
amorphous
is
inescapable
for
a
bourgeois
regime
.


(Consider
here
the
theory
of
the
state
that
stands
‘above’
class
antagonisms
,
or
the
notion
of
an
‘impartial’
system
of
justice
.

)

But
the
veil
drawn
over
the
nature
of
bourgeois
society
is
indispensable
to
the
bourgeoisie
itself
.


For
the
insoluble
internal
contradictions
of
the
system
become
revealed
with
,
increasing
starkness
and
so
confront
its
supporters
with
a
choice
.


Either
they
must
consciously
ignore
insights
which
become
increasingly
urgent
or
else
they
must
suppress
their
own
moral
instincts
in
order
to
be
able
to
support
with
a
good
conscience
an
economic
system
that
serves
only
their
own
interests
.


.


Without
overestimating
the
efficacy
of
such
ideological
factors
it
must
be
agreed
that
the
fighting
power
of
a
class
grows
with
its
ability
to
carry
out
its
own
mission
with
a
good
conscience
and
to
adapt
all
phenomena
to
its
own
interests
with
unbroken
confidence
in
itself
.


If
we
consider
Sismondi’s
criticism
of
classical
economics
,
German
criticisms
of
natural
law
and
the
youthful
critiques
of
,
Carlyle
it
becomes
evident
that
from
a
very
early
stage
the
ideological
history
of
the
bourgeoisie
was
nothing
but
a
desperate
resistance
to
every
insight
into
the
true
nature
of
the
society
it
had
created
and
thus
to
a
real
understanding
of
its
class
situation
.


When
the
Communist
Manifesto
makes
the
point
that
the
bourgeoisie
produces
its
own
grave-diggers
this
is
valid
ideologically
as
well
as
economically
.


The
whole
of
bourgeois
thought
in
the
nineteenth
century
made
the
most
strenuous
efforts
to
mask
the
real
foundations
of
bourgeois
society
;
everything
was
tried
:
from
the
greatest
falsifications
of
fact
to
the
‘sublime’
theories
about
the
‘essence’
of
history
and
the
state
.


But
in
vain
:
with
the
end
of
the
century
the
issue
was
resolved
by
the
advances
of
science
and
their
corresponding
effects
on
the
consciousness
of
the
capitalist
elite
.



This
can
be
seen
very
clearly
in
the
bourgeoisie’s
greater
readiness
to
accept
the
idea
of
conscious
organisation
.


A
greater
measure
of
concentration
was
achieved
first
in
the
stock
companies
and
in
the
cartels
and
trusts
.


This
process
revealed
the
social’
character
of
capital
more
and
more
clearly
without
affecting
the
general
anarchy
in
production
.


What
it
did
was
to
confer
near-monopoly
status
on
a
number
of
giant
individual
capitalists
.


Objectively
,
then
,
the
social
character
of
capital
was
brought
into
play
with
great
energy
but
in
such
a
manner
as
to
keep
its
nature
concealed
from
the
capitalist
class
.


Indeed
this
illusory
elimination
of
economic
anarchy
successfully
diverted
their
attention
from
the
true
situation
.


With
the
crises
of
the
War
and
the
post-war
period
this
tendency
has
advanced
still
further
:
the
idea
of
a
‘planned’
economy
has
gained
ground
at
least
among
the
more
progressive
elements
of
the
bourgeoisie
.


Admittedly
this
applies
only
within
quite
harrow
strata
of
the
bourgeoisie
and
even
there
it
is
thought
of
more
as
a
theoretical
experiment
than
as
a
practical
way
out
of
the
impasse
brought
about
by
the
crises
.



When
capitalism
was
still
expanding
it
rejected
every
sort
of
social
organisation
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
“an
inroad
upon
such
sacred
things
as
the
rights
of
property
,
freedom
and
unrestricted
play
for
the
initiative
of
the
individual
capitalist
.

”
^([36])
If
we
compare
that
with
current
attempts
to
harmonise
a
‘planned’
economy
with
the
class
interests
of
the
bourgeoisie
,
we
are
forced
to
admit
that
what
we
are
witnessing
is
the
capitulation
of
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
before
that
of
the
proletariat
.


Of
course
the
section
of
the
bourgeoisie
that
accepts
the
notion
of
a
‘planned’
economy
does
not
mean
by
it
the
same
as
does
the
proletariat
:
it
,
regards
it
as
a
last
attempt
to
save
capitalism
by
driving
its
internal
contradictions
to
breaking-point
.


Nevertheless
this
means
jettisoning
the
last
theoretical
line
of
defence
.


(As
a
strange
counterpart
to
this
we
may
note
that
at
just
this
point
in
time
certain
sectors
of
the
proletariat
capitulate
before
the
bourgeoisie
and
adopt
this
,
the
most
problematic
form
of
bourgeois
organisation
.

)

With
this
the
whole
existence
of
the
bourgeoisie
and
its
culture
is
plunged
into
the
most
terrible
crisis
.


On
the
one
hand
,
we
find
the
utter
sterility
of
an
ideology
divorced
from
life
,
of
a
more
or
less
conscious
attempt
at
forgery
.


On
the
other
hand
,
a
cynicism
no
less
terribly
jejune
lives
on
in
the
world-historical
irrelevances
and
nullities
of
its
own
existence
and
concerns
itself
only
with
the
defence
of
that
existence
and
with
its
own
naked
self-interest
.


This
ideological
crisis
is
an
unfailing
sign
of
decay
.


The
bourgeoisie
has
already
been
thrown
on
the
defensive
;
however
aggressive
its
weapons
may
be
,
it
is
fighting
for
self-preservation
.


Its
power
to
dominate
has
vanished
beyond
recall
.

In
this
struggle
for
consciousness
historical
materialism
plays
a
crucial
role
.


Ideologically
no
less
than
economically
,
the
bourgeoisie
and
the
proletariat
are
mutually
interdependent
.


The
same
process
that
the
bourgeoisie
experiences
as
a
permanent
crisis
and
gradual
dissolution
appears
to
the
proletariat
,
likewise
in
crisis-form
,
as
the
gathering
of
strength
and
the
springboard
to
victory
.


Ideologically
this
means
that
the
same
growth
of
insight
into
the
nature
of
society
,
which
reflects
the
protracted
death
struggle
of
the
bourgeoisie
,
entails
a
steady
growth
in
the
strength
of
the
proletariat
.


For
the
proletariat
the
truth
is
a
weapon
that
brings
victory
;
and
the
more
ruthless
,
the
greater
the
victory
.


This
makes
more
comprehensible
the
desperate
fury
with
which
bourgeois
science
assails
historical
materialism
:
for
as
soon
as
the
bourgeoisie
is
forced
to
take
up
its
stand
on
this
terrain
,
it
is
lost
.


And
,
at
the
same
time
,
this
explains
why
the
proletariat
and
only
the
proletariat
can
discern
in
the
correct
understanding
of
the
nature
of
society
a
power-factor
of
the
first
,
and
perhaps
decisive
importance
.



The
unique
function
of
consciousness
in
the
class
struggle
of
the
proletariat
has
consistently
been
overlooked
by
the
vulgar
Marxists
who
have
substituted
a
petty
‘Realpolitik’
for
the
great
battle
of
principle
which
reaches
back
to
the
ultimate
problems
of
the
objective
economic
process
.


Naturally
we
do
not
wish
to
deny
that
the
proletariat
must
proceed
from
the
facts
of
a
given
situation
.


But
it
is
to
be
distinguished
from
other
classes
by
the
fact
that
it
goes
beyond
the
contingencies
of
history
;
far
from
being
driven
forward
by
them
,
it
is
itself
their
driving
force
and
impinges
centrally
upon
the
process
of
social
change
.


When
the
vulgar
Marxists
detach
themselves
from
this
central
point
of
view
,
i
.

e
.


from
the
point
where
a
proletarian
class
consciousness
arises
,
they
thereby
place
themselves
on
the
level
of
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
.


And
that
the
bourgeoisie
fighting
on
its
own
ground
will
prove
superior
to
the
proletariat
both
economically
and
ideologically
can
come
as
a
surprise
only
to
a
vulgar
Marxist
.


Moreover
only
a
vulgar
Marxist
would
infer
from
this
fact
,
which
after
all
derives
exclusively
from
his
own
attitude
,
that
the
bourgeoisie
generally
occupies
the
stronger
position
.


For
quite
apart
from
the
very
real
force
at
its
disposal
,
it
is
self-evident
that
the
bourgeoisie
fighting
on
its
own
ground
will
be
both
more
experienced
and
more
expert
.


Nor
will
it
come
as
a
surprise
if
the
bourgeoisie
automatically
obtains
the
upper
hand
when
its
opponents
abandon
their
own
position
for
that
of
the
bourgeoisie
.



As
the
bourgeoisie
has
the
intellectual
,
organisational
and
every
other
advantage
,
the
superiority
of
the
proletariat
must
lie
exclusively
in
its
ability
to
see
society
from
the
centre
as
a
coherent
whole
.


This
means
that
it
is
able
to
act
in
such
a
way
as
to
change
reality
;
in
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
theory
and
practice
coincide
and
so
it
can
consciously
throw
the
weight
of
its
actions
onto
the
scales
of
history
–
and
this
is
the
deciding
factor
.


When
the
vulgar
Marxists
destroy
this
unity
they
cut
the
nerve
that
binds
proletarian
theory
to
proletarian
action
.


They
reduce
theory
to
the
‘scientific’
treatment
of
the
symptoms
of
social
change
and
as
for
practice
they
are
themselves
reduced
to
being
buffeted
about
aimlessly
and
uncontrollably
by
the
various
elements
of
the
process
they
had
hoped
to
master
.



The
class
consciousness
that
springs
from
this
position
must
exhibit
the
same
internal
structure
as
that
of
the
bourgeoisie
.


But
when
the
logic
of
events
drives
the
same
dialectical
contradictions
to
the
surface
of
consciousness
the
consequences
for
the
proletariat
are
even
more
disastrous
than
for
the
bourgeoisie
.


For
despite
all
the
dialectical
contradictions
,
despite
all
its
objective
falseness
,
the
self-deceiving
‘false’
consciousness
that
we
find
in
the
bourgeoisie
is
at
least
in
accord
with
its
class
situation
.


It
cannot
save
the
bourgeoisie
from
the
constant
exacerbation
of
these
contradictions
and
so
from
destruction
,
but
it
can
enable
it
to
continue
the
struggle
and
even
engineer
victories
,
albeit
of
short
duration
.



But
in
the
case
of
the
proletariat
such
a
consciousness
not
only
has
to
overcome
these
internal
(bourgeois)
contradictions
,
but
it
also
conflicts
with
the
course
of
action
to
which
the
economic
situation
necessarily
commits
the
proletariat
(regardless
of
its
own
thoughts
on
the
subject)
.


The
proletariat
must
act
in
a
proletarian
manner
,
but
its
own
vulgar
Marxist
theory
blocks
its
vision
of
the
right
course
to
adopt
.


The
dialectical
contradiction
between
necessary
proletarian
action
and
vulgar
Marxist
(bourgeois)
theory
becomes
more
and
more
acute
.


As
the
decisive
battle
in
the
class
struggle
approaches
,
the
power
of
a
true
or
false
theory
to
accelerate
or
retard
progress
grows
in
proportion
.


The
‘realm
of
freedom’
,
the
end
of
the
‘pre-history
of
mankind’
means
precisely
that
the
power
of
the
objectified
,
reified
relations
between
men
begins
to
revert
to
man
.


The
closer
this
process
comes
to
it
1
s
goal
the
more
urgent
it
becomes
for
the
proletariat
to
understand
its
own
historical
mission
and
the
more
vigorously
and
directly
proletarian
class
consciousness
will
determine
each
of
its
actions
.


For
the
blind
power
of
the
forces
at
work
will
only
advance
‘automatically’
to
their
goal
of
self-annihilation
as
long
as
that
goal
is
not
within
reach
.


When
the
moment
of
transition
to
the
‘realm
of
freedom’
arrives
this
will
become
apparent
just
because
the
blind
forces
really
will
hurtle
blindly
towards
the
abyss
,
and
only
the
conscious
will
of
the
proletariat
will
be
able
to
save
mankind
from
the
impending
catastrophe
.


In
other
words
,
when
the
final
economic
crisis
of
capitalism
develops
,
the
fate
of
the
revolution
(and
with
it
the
fate
of
mankind)
will
depend
on
the
ideological
maturity
of
the
proletariat
,
i
.

e
.


on
its
class
consciousness
.



We
have
now
determined
the
unique
function
of
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
in
contrast
to
that
of
other
classes
.


The
proletariat
cannot
liberate
itself
as
a
class
without
simultaneously
abolishing
class
society
as
such
.


For
that
reason
its
consciousness
,
the
last
class
consciousness
in
the
history
of
mankind
,
must
both
lay
bare
the
nature
of
society
and
achieve
an
increasingly
inward
fusion
of
theory
and
practice
.


‘Ideology’
for
the
proletariat
is
no
banner
to
follow
into
battle
,
nor
is
it
a
cover
for
its
true
objectives
:
it
is
the
objective
and
the
weapon
itself
.


Every
non-principled
or
unprincipled
use
of
tactics
on
the
part
of
the
proletariat
debases
historical
materialism
to
the
level
of
mere
‘ideology’
and
forces
the
proletariat
to
use
bourgeois
(or
petty
bourgeois)
tactics
.


It
thereby
robs
it
of
its
greatest
strength
by
forcing
class
consciousness
into
the
secondary
or
inhibiting
role
of
a
bourgeois
consciousness
,
instead
of
the
active
role
of
a
proletarian
consciousness
.



The
relationship
between
class
consciousness
and
class
situation
is
really
very
simple
in
the
case
of
the
proletariat
,
but
the
obstacles
which
prevent
its
consciousness
being
realised
in
practice
are
correspondingly
greater
.


In
the
first
place
this
consciousness
is
divided
within
itself
.


It
is
true
that
society
as
such
is
highly
unified
and
that
it
evolves
in
a
unified
manner
.


But
in
a
world
where
the
reified
relations
of
capitalism
have
the
appearance
of
a
natural
environment
it
looks
as
if
there
is
not
a
unity
but
a
diversity
of
mutually
independent
objects
and
forces
.


The
most
striking
division
in
proletarian
class
consciousness
and
the
one
most
fraught
with
consequences
is
the
separation
of
the
economic
struggle
from
the
political
one
.


Marx
repeatedly
exposed
^([37])
the
fallacy
of
this
split
and
demonstrated
that
it
is
in
the
nature
of
every
economic
struggle
to
develop
into
a
political
one
(and
vice
versa)
.


Nevertheless
it
has
not
proved
possible
to
eradicate
this
heresy
from
the
theory
of
the
proletariat
.


The
cause
of
this
aberration
is
to
be
found
in
the
dialectical
separation
of
immediate
objectives
and
ultimate
goal
and
,
hence
,
in
the
dialectical
division
within
the
proletarian
revolution
itself
.



Classes
that
successfully
carried
out
revolutions
in
earlier
societies
had
their
task
made
easier
subjective
by
this
very
fact
of
the
discrepancy
between
their
own
class
consciousness
and
the
objective
economic
set-up
,
i
.

e
.


by
their
very
unawareness
of
their
own
function
in
the
process
of
change
.


They
had
only
to
use
the
power
at
their
disposal
to
enforce
their
immediate
interests
while
the
social
import
of
their
actions
was
hidden
from
them
and
left
to
the
‘ruse
of
reason’
of
the
course
of
events
.



But
as
the
proletariat
has
been
entrusted
by
history
with
the
task
of
transforming
social
consciously
,
its
class
consciousness
must
develop
a
dialectical
contradiction
between
its
immediate
interests
and
its
long-term
objectives
,
and
between
the
discrete
factors
and
the
whole
.


For
the
discrete
factor
,
the
concrete
situation
with
its
concrete
demands
is
by
its
very
nature
an
integral
part
of
the
existing
capitalist
society
;
it
is
governed
by
the
laws
of
that
society
and
is
subject
to
its
economic
structure
.


Only
when
the
immediate
interests
are
integrated
into
a
total
view
and
related
to
the
final
goal
of
the
process
do
they
become
revolutionary
,
pointing
concretely
and
consciously
beyond
the
confines
of
capitalist
society
.



This
means
that
subjectively
,
i
.

e
.


for
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
,
the
dialectical
relationship
between
immediate
interests
and
objective
impact
on
the
whole
of
society
is
loc
in
the
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
itself
.


It
does
not
work
itself
out
as
a
purely
objective
process
quite
apart
from
all
(imputed)
consciousness
–
as
was
the
case
with
all
classes
hitherto
.


Thus
the
revolutionary
victory
of
the
proletariat
does
not
imply
,
as
with
former
classes
,
the
immediate
realisation
of
the
socially
given
existence
of
the
class
,
but
,
as
the
young
Marx
clearly
saw
and
defined
,
its
self-annihilation
.


The
Communist
Manifesto
formulates
this
distinction
in
this
way
:
“All
the
preceding
classes
that
got
the
upper
hand
,
sought
to
fortify
their
already
acquired
status
by
subjecting
society
at
large
to
their
conditions
of
appropriation
.


The
proletarians
cannot
become
masters
of
the
productive
forces
of
society
except
by
abolishing
their
own
previous
mode
of
appropriation
,
and
thereby
every
other
previous
mode
of
appropriation
.

”
(my

This
inner
dialectic
makes
it
hard
for
the
proletariat
to
develop
its
class
consciousness
in
opposition
to
that
of
the
bourgeoisie
which
by
cultivating
the
crudest
and
most
abstract
kind
of
empiricism
was
able
to
make
do
with
a
superficial
view
of
the
world
.


Whereas
even
when
the
development
of
the
proletariat
was
still
at
a
very
primitive
stage
it
discovered
that
one
of
the
elementary
rules
of
class
warfare
was
to
advance
beyond
what
was
immediately
given
.


(Marx
emphasises
this
as
early
as
his
observations
on
the
Weavers’
Uprising
in
Silesia
.

)
^([38])
For
because
of
its
situation
this
contradiction
is
introduced
directly
into
the
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
,
whereas
the
bourgeoisie
,
from
its
situation
,
saw
the
contradictions
confronting
it
as
the
outer
limits
of
its
consciousness
.



Conversely
,
this
contradiction
means
that
‘false’
consciousness
is
something
very
different
for
the
proletariat
than
for
every
preceding
class
.


Even
correct
statements
about
particular
situations
or
aspects
of
the
development
of
bourgeois
class
consciousness
reveal
,
when
related
to
the
whole
of
society
,
the
limits
of
that
consciousness
and
unmask
its
‘falseness’
.


Whereas
the
proletariat
always
aspires
towards
the
truth
even
in
its
‘false’
consciousness
and
in
its
substantive
errors
.


It
is
sufficient
here
to
recall
the
social
criticism
of
the
Utopians
or
the
proletarian
and
revolutionary
extension
of
Ricardo’s
theory
.


Concerning
the
latter
,
Engels
places
great
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
it
is
“formally
incorrect
economically”
,
but
he
adds
at
once
:
“What
is
false
from
a
formal
economic
point
of
view
can
be
true
in
the
perspective
of
world
history
.


.


.


.


Behind
the
formal
economic
error
may
lie
concealed
a
very
true
economic
content
.

”
^([39])

Only
with
the
aid
of
this
distinction
can
there
be
any
resolution
of
the
contradiction
in
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
;
only
with
its
aid
can
that
contradiction
become
a
conscious
f
actor
in
history
.


For
the
objective
aspiration
towards
truth
which
is
immanent
even
in
the
‘false’
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
does
not
at
all
imply
that
this
aspiration
can
come
to
light
without
the
active
intervention
of
the
proletariat
.


On
the
contrary
,
the
mere
aspiration
towards
truth
can
only
strip
off
the
veils
of
falseness
and
mature
into
historically
significant
and
socially
revolutionary
knowledge
by
the
potentiating
of
consciousness
,
by
conscious
action
and
conscious
self-criticism
.


Such
knowledge
would
of
course
be
unattainable
were
it
not
for
the
objective
aspiration
,
and
here
we
find
confirmation
of
Marx’s
dictum
that
mankind
only
ever
sets
itself
tasks
which
it
can
accomplish”
.


^([40])
But
the
aspiration
only
yields
the
possibility
.


The
accomplishment
can
only
be
the
fruit
of
the
conscious
deeds
of
the
proletariat
.



The
dialectical
cleavage
in
the
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
is
a
product
of
the
same
structure
that
makes
the
historical
mission
of
the
proletariat
possible
by
pointing
forward
and
beyond
the
existing
social
order
.


In
the
case
of
the
other
classes
we
found
an
antagonism
between
the
class’s
self-interest
and
that
of
society
,
between
individual
deed
and
social
consequences
.


This
antagonism
set
an
external
limit
to
consciousness
.


Here
,
in
the
centre
of
proletarian
class
consciousness
we
discover
an
antagonism
between
momentary
interest
and
ultimate
goal
.


The
outward
victory
of
the
proletariat
can
only
be
achieved
if
this
antagonism
is
inwardly
overcome
.



As
we
stressed
in
the
motto
to
this
essay
the
existence
of
this
conflict
enables
us
to
perceive
that
class
consciousness
is
identical
with
neither
the
psychological
consciousness
of
individual
members
of
the
proletariat
,
nor
with
the
(mass-psychological)
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
as
a
whole
;
but
it
is
,
on
the
contrary
,
the
sense
,
become
conscious
,
of
the
historical
role
of
the
class
.


This
sense
will
objectify
itself
in
particular
interests
of
the
moment
and
it
may
only
be
ignored
at
the
price
of
allowing
the
proletarian
class
struggle
to
slip
back
into
the
most
primitive
Utopianism
.


Every
momentary
interest
may
have
either
of
two
functions
:
either
it
will
be
a
step
towards
the
ultimate
goal
or
else
it
will
conceal
it
.


Which
of
the
two
it
will
be
depends
entirely
upon
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
and
not
on
victory
or
defeat
in
isolated
skirmishes
.


Marx
drew
attention
very
early
on
^([41])
to
this
danger
,
which
is
particularly
acute
on
the
economic
‘trade-union’
front
:
“At
the
same
time
the
working
class
ought
not
to
exaggerate
to
themselves
the
ultimate
consequence
s
of
these
struggles
.


They
ought
not
to
forget
that
they
are
fighting
with
effects
,
but
not
with
the
causes
of
those
effects
.


.


.


,
that
they
are
applying
palliatives
,
not
curing
the
malady
.


They
ought
,
therefore
,
not
to
be
exclusively
absorbed
in
these
unavoidable
guerilla
fights
.


.


.


instead
of
simultaneously
trying
to
cure
it
,
instead
of
using
their
organised
forces
as
a
lever
for
the
final
emancipation
of
the
working
class
,
that
is
to
say
,
the
ultimate
abolition
of
the
wages
system
.

"

We
see
here
the
source
of
every
kind
of
opportunism
which
begins
always
with
effects
and
not
causes
,
parts
and
not
the
whole
,
symptoms
and
not
the
thing
itself
.


It
does
not
regard
the
particular
interest
and
the
struggle
to
achieve
it
as
a
means
of
education
for
the
final
battle
whose
outcome
depends
on
closing
the
gap
between
the
psychological
consciousness
and
the
imputed
one
.


Instead
it
regards
the
particular
as
a
valuable
achievement
in
itself
or
at
least
as
a
step
along
the
path
towards
the
ultimate
goal
.


In
a
word
,
opportunism
mistakes
the
actual
,
psychological
state
0
consciousness
of
proletarians
for
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
.



The
practical
damage
resulting
from
this
confusion
can
be
seen
in
the
great
loss
of
unity
and
cohesiveness
in
proletarian
praxis
when
compared
to
the
unity
of
the
objective
economic
tendencies
.


The
superior
strength
of
true
,
practical
class
consciousness
lies
in
the
ability
to
look
beyond
the
divisive
symptoms
of
the
economic
process
to
the
unity
of
the
total
social
system
underlying
it
.


In
the
age
of
capitalism
it
is
not
possible
for
the
total
system
to
become
directly
visible
in
external
phenomena
.


For
instance
,
the
economic
basis
of
a
world
crisis
is
undoubtedly
unified
and
its
coherence
can
be
understood
.


But
its
actual
appearance
in
time
and
space
will
take
the
form
of
a
disparate
succession
of
events
in
different
countries
at
different
times
and
even
in
different
branches
of
industry
in
a
number
of
countries
.



When
bourgeois
thought
“transforms
the
different
limbs
Of
society
into
so
many
separate
societies”
^([42])
it
certainly
commits
a
grave
theoretical
error
.


But
the
immediate
practical
consequences
are
nevertheless
in
harmony
with
the
interests
of
capitalism
.


The
bourgeoisie
is
unable
in
theory
to
understand
more
than
the
details
and
the
symptoms
of
economic
processes
(a
failure
which
will
ultimately
prove
its
undoing)
.


In
the
short
term
,
however
,
it
is
concerned
above
all
to
impose
its
mode
of
life
upon
the
day-to-day
actions
of
the
proletariat
.


In
this
respect
(and
in
this
respect
alone)
its
superiority
in
organisation
is
clearly
visible
,
while
the
wholly
different
organisation
of
the
proletariat
,
its
capacity
for
being
organised
as
a
class
,
cannot
become
effective
.



The
further
the
economic
crisis
of
capitalism
advances
the
more
clearly
this
unity
in
the
economic
process
becomes
comprehensible
in
practice
.


It
was
there
,
of
course
,
in
so-called
periods
of
normality
,
too
,
and
was
therefore
visible
from
the
class
standpoint
of
the
proletariat
,
but
the
gap
between
appearance
and
ultimate
reality
was
too
great
for
that
unity
to
have
any
practical
consequences
for
proletarian
action
.



In
periods
of
crisis
the
position
is
quite
different
.


The
unity
of
the
economic
process
now
moves
within
reach
.


So
much
so
that
even
capitalist
theory
cannot
remain
wholly
untouched
by
it
,
though
it
can
never
fully
adjust
to
it
.


In
this
situation
the
fate
of
the
proletariat
,
and
hence
of
the
whole
future
of
humanity
,
hangs
on
whether
or
not
it
will
take
the
step
that
has
now
become
objectively
possible
.


For
even
if
the
particular
symptoms
of
crisis
appear
separately
(according
to
country
,
branch
of
industry
,
in
the
form
of
‘economic’
or
‘political’
crisis
,
etc
.

)
,
and
even
if
in
consequence
the
reflex
of
the
crisis
is
fragmented
in
the
immediate
psychological
consciousness
of
the
workers
,
it
is
still
possible
and
necessary
to
advance
beyond
this
consciousness
.


And
this
is
instinctively
felt
to
be
a
necessity
by
larger
and
larger
sections
of
the
proletariat
.



Opportunism
had
–
as
it
seemed
–
merely
served
to
inhibit
the
objective
tendency
until
the
crisis
became
acute
.


Now
,
however
,
it
adopts
a
course
directly
opposed
to
it
.


Its
aim
now
is
to
scotch
the
development
of
proletarian
class
consciousness
in
its
progress
from
that
which
is
merely
given
to
that
which
conforms
to
the
objective
total
process
;
even
more
,
it
hopes
to
reduce
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
to
the
level
of
the
psychologically
given
and
thus
to
divert
into
the
opposite
direction
what
had
hitherto
been
the
purely
instinctive
tendency
.


As
long
as
the
unification
of
proletarian
class
consciousness
was
not
a
practical
possibility
this
theory
could
–
with
some
charity
–
be
regarded
as
a
mere
error
.


But
in
this
situation
it
takes
on
the
character
of
a
conscious
deception
.

(regardless
of
whether
its
advocates
are
psychologically
conscious
of
this
or
not)
.


In
contrast
with
the
right
instincts
of
the
proletariat
it
plays
the
same
role
as
that
played
hitherto
by
Capitalist
theory
:
it
denounces
the
correct
view
of
the
overall
economic
situation
and
the
correct
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
together
with
its
organised
form
,
the
Communist
Party
,
as
something
unreal
and
inimical
to
the
‘true’
interests
of
the
workers
(i
.

e
.


their
immediate
,
national
or
professional
interests)
and
as
something
alien
to
their
‘genuine’
class
consciousness
(i
.

e
.


that
which
is
psychologically
given)
.



To
say
that
class
consciousness
has
no
psychological
reality
does
not
imply
that
it
is
a
mere
fiction
.


Its
reality
is
vouched
for
by
its
ability
to
explain
the
infinitely
painful
path
of
the
proletarian
revolution
,
with
its
many
reverses
,
its
constant
return
to
its
starting-point
and
the
incessant
self-criticism
of
which
Marx
speaks
in
the
celebrated
passage
in
The
Eighteenth
Brumaire
.



Only
the
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
can
point
to
the
way
that
leads
out
of
the
impasse
of
capitalism
.


As
long
as
this
consciousness
is
lacking
,
the
crisis
remains
permanent
,
it
goes
back
to
its
starting-point
,
repeats
the
cycle
until
after
infinite
sufferings
and
terrible
detours
the
school
of
history
completes
the
education
of
the
proletariat
and
confers
upon
it
the
leadership
of
mankind
.


But
the
proletariat
is
not
given
any
choice
.


As
Marx
says
,
it
must
become
a
class
not
only
“as
against
capital”
but
also
“for
itself”
;
^([43])
that
is
to
say
,
the
class
struggle
must
be
raised
from
the
level
of
economic
necessity
to
the
level
of
conscious
aim
and
effective
class
consciousness
.


The
pacifists
and
humanitarians
of
the
class
struggle
whose
efforts
tend
whether
they
will
or
no
to
retard
this
lengthy
,
painful
and
crisis-ridden
process
would
be
horrified
if
they
could
but
see
what
sufferings
they
inflict
on
the
proletariat
by
extending
this
course
of
education
.


But
the
proletariat
cannot
abdicate
its
mission
.


The
only
question
at
issue
is
how
much
it
has
to
suffer
before
it
achieves
ideological
maturity
,
before
it
acquires
a
true
understanding
of
its
class
situation
and
a
true
class
consciousness
.



Of
course
this
uncertainty
and
lack
of
clarity
are
themselves
the
symptoms
of
the
crisis
in
bourgeois
society
.


As
the
product
of
capitalism
the
proletariat
must
necessarily
be
subject
to
the
modes
of
existence
of
its
creator
.


This
mode
of
existence
is
inhumanity
and
reification
.


No
doubt
the
very
existence
of
the
proletariat
implies
criticism
and
the
negation
of
this
form
of
life
.


But
until
the
objective
crisis
of
capitalism
has
matured
and
until
the
proletariat
has
achieved
true
class
consciousness
,
and
the
ability
to
understand
the
crisis
fully
,
it
cannot
go
beyond
the
criticism
of
reification
and
so
it
is
only
negatively
superior
to
its
antagonist
.


Indeed
,
if
it
can
do
no
more
than
negate
some
aspects
of
capitalism
,
if
it
cannot
at
least
aspire
to
a
critique
of
the
whole
,
then
it
will
not
even
achieve
a
negative
superiority
.


This
applies
to
the
petty-bourgeois
attitudes
of
most
trade
unionists
.


Such
criticism
from
the
standpoint
of
capitalism
can
be
seen
most
strikingly
in
the
separation
of
the
various
theatres
of
war
.


The
bare
fact
of
separation
itself
indicates
that
the
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
is
still
fettered
by
reification
.


And
if
the
proletariat
finds
the
economic
inhumanity
to
which
it
is
subjected
easier
to
understand
than
the
political
,
and
the
political
easier
than
the
cultural
,
then
all
these
separations
point
to
the
extent
of
the
still
unconquered
power
of
capitalist
forms
of
life
in
the
proletariat
itself
.



The
reified
consciousness
must
also
remain
hopelessly
trapped
in
the
two
extremes
of
crude
empiricism
and
abstract
utopianism
.


In
the
one
case
,
consciousness
becomes
either
a
completely
passive
observer
moving
in
obedience
to
laws
which
it
can
never
control
.


In
the
other
it
regards
itself
as
a
power
which
is
able
of
its
own
–
subjective
–
volition
to
master
the
essentially
meaningless
motion
of
objects
.


We
have
already
identified
the
crude
empiricism
of
the
opportunists
in
its
relation
to
proletarian
class
consciousness
.


We
must
now
go
on
to
see
utopianism
as
characteristic
of
the
internal
divisions
within
class
consciousness
.


(The
separation
of
empiricism
from
utopianism
undertaken
here
for
purely
methodological
reasons
should
not
be
taken
as
an
admission
that
the
two
cannot
occur
together
in
particular
trends
and
even
individuals
.


On
the
contrary
,
they
are
frequently
found
together
and
are
joined
by
an
internal
bond
.

)

The
philosophical
efforts
of
the
young
Marx
were
largely
directed
towards
the
refutation
of
the
various
false
theories
of
consciousness
(including
both
the
‘idealism’
of
the
Hegelian
School
and
the
‘materialism’
of
Feuerbach)
and
towards
the
discovery
of
a
correct
view
of
the
role
of
consciousness
in
history
.


As
early
as
the
Correspondence
of
1843
[with
Ruge]
he
conceives
of
consciousness
as
immanent
in
history
.


Consciousness
does
not
lie
outside
the
real
process
of
history
.


It
does
not
have
to
be
introduced
into
the
world
by
philosophers
;
therefore
to
gaze
down
arrogantly
upon
the
petty
struggles
of
the
world
and
to
despise
them
is
indefensible
.


“We
only
show
it
[the
world]
what
its
struggles
are
about
and
consciousness
is
a
thing
that
it
must
needs
acquire
whether
it
will
or
not
.

”
What
is
needed
then
is
only
“to
explain
its
own
actions
to
it”
.


^([44])
The
great
polemic
against
Hegel
in
The
Holy
Family
concentrates
mainly
on
this
point
.


^([45])
,
Hegel’s
inadequacy
is
that
he
only
seems
to
allow
the
absolute
spirit
to
make
history
.


The
resulting
otherworldliness
of
consciousness
vis-à-vis
the
real
events
of
history
becomes
,
in
the
hands
of
Hegel’s
disciples
,
an
arrogant
–
and
reactionary
confrontation
of
‘spirit’
and
‘mass’
.


Marx
mercilessly
exposes
the
flaws
and
absurdities
and
the
reversions
to
a
pre-Hegelian
stage
implicit
in
this
approach
.



Complementing
this
is
his
–
aphoristic
–
critique
of
Feuerbach
.


The
materialists
had
elaborated
a
view
of
consciousness
as
of
something
appertaining
to
this
world
.


Marx
sees
it
as
merely
one
stage
in
the
process
,
the
stage
of
‘bourgeois
society’
.


He
opposes
to
it
the
notion
of
consciousness
as
‘practical
critical
activity’
with
the
task
of
‘changing
the
world’
.



This
provides
us
with
the
philosophical
foundation
we
need
to
settle
accounts
with
the
utopians
.


For
their
thought
contains
this
very
duality
of
social
process
and
the
consciousness
of
it
.


Consciousness
approaches
society
from
another
world
and
leads
it
from
.


the
false
path
it
has
followed
back
to
the
right
one
.


The
utopians
are
prevented
by
the
undeveloped
nature
of
the
proletarian
movement
from
seeing
the
true
bearer
of
historical
movement
in
history
itself
,
in
the
way
the
proletariat
organises
itself
as
a
class
and
,
hence
,
in
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
.


They
are
not
yet
able
to
“take
note
of
what
is
happening
before
their
very
eyes
and
to
become
its
mouthpiece”
.


^([46])

It
would
be
foolish
to
believe
that
this
criticism
and
the
recognition
that
a
post-utopian
attitude
to
history
has
become
objectively
possible
means
that
utopianism
can
be
dismissed
as
a
factor
in
the
proletariat’s
struggle
for
freedom
.


This
is
true
only
for
those
stages
of
class
consciousness
that
have
really
achieved
the
unity
of
theory
and
practice
described
by
Marx
,
the
real
and
practical
intervention
of
class
consciousness
in
the
course
of
history
and
hence
the
practical
understanding
of
reification
.


And
this
did
not
all
happen
at
a
single
stroke
and
in
a
coherent
manner
.


For
there
are
not
merely
national
and
‘social’
stages
involved
but
there
are
also
gradations
within
the
class
consciousness
of
workers
in
the
same
strata
.


The
separation
of
economics
from
politics
is
the
most
revealing
and
also
the
most
important
instance
of
this
.


It
appears
that
some
sections
of
the
proletariat
have
quite
the
right
instincts
as
far
as
the
economic
struggle
goes
and
can
even
raise
them
to
the
level
of
class
consciousness
.


At
the
same
time
,
‘however
,
when
it
comes
to
political
questions
they
manage
to
persist
in
a
completely
utopian
point
of
view
.


It
does
not
need
to
be
emphasised
that
there
is
no
question
here
of
a
mechanical
duality
.


The
utopian
view
of
the
function
of
politics
must
impinge
dialectically
on
their
views
about
economics
and
,
in
particular
,
on
their
notions
about
the
economy
as
a
totality
(as
,
for
example
,
in
the
Syndicalist
theory
of
revolution)
.


In
the
absence
of
a
real
understanding
of
the
interaction
between
politics
and
economics
a
war
against
the
whole
economic
system
,
to
say
nothing
of
its
reorganisation
,
is
quite
out
of
the
question
.



The
influence
enjoyed
even
today
by
such
completely
utopian
theories
as
those
of
Ballod
or
of
guild-socialism
shows
the
extent
to
which
utopian
thought
is
still
prevalent
,
even
at
a
level
where
the
direct
life-interests
of
the
proletariat
are
most
nearly
concerned
and
where
the
present
crisis
makes
it
possible
to
read
off
from
history
the
correct
course
of
action
to
be
followed
.



This
syndrome
must
make
its
appearance
even
more
blatantly
where
it
is
not
yet
possible
to
see
society
;is
a
whole
.


This
can
be
seen
at
its
clearest
in
purely
ideological
questions
,
in
questions
of
culture
.


These
questions
occupy
an
almost
wholly
isolated
position
in
the
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
;
the
organic
bonds
connecting
these
issues
with
the
immediate
life-interests
of
the
proletariat
as
well
as
with
society
as
a
whole
have
not
even
begun
to
penetrate
its
consciousness
.


The
achievement
in
this
area
hardly
ever
goes
beyond
the
self-criticism
of
capitalism
–
carried
out
here
by
the
proletariat
.


What
is
positive
here
in
theory
and
practice
is
almost
entirely
utopian
.



These
gradations
are
,
then
,
on
the
one
hand
,
objective
historical
necessities
,
nuances
in
the
objective
possibilities
of
consciousness
(such
as
the
relative
cohesiveness
of
politics
and
economics
in
comparison
to
cultural
questions)
.


On
the
other
hand
,
where
consciousness
already
exists
as
an
objective
possibility
,
they
indicate
degrees
of
distance
between
the
psychological
class
consciousness
and
the
adequate
understanding
of
the
total
situation
.


These
gradations
,
however
,
can
no
longer
be
referred
back
to
socioeconomic
causes
.


The
objective
theory
of
class
consciousness
is
the
theory
of
its
objective
possibility
.


The
stratification
of
the
problems
and
economic
interests
within
the
proletariat
is
,
unfortunately
,
almost
wholly
unexplored
,
but
research
would
undoubtedly
lead
to
discoveries
of
the
very
first
importance
.


But
however
useful
it
would
be
to
produce
a
typology
of
the
various
strata
,
we
would
still
be
confronted
at
every
turn
with
the
problem
of
whether
it
is
actually
possible
to
make
the
objective
possibility
of
class
consciousness
into
a
reality
.


Hitherto
this
question
could
only
occur
to
extraordinary
individuals
(consider
Marx’s
completely
non-utopian
prescience
with
regard
to
the
problems
of
dictatorship)
.


Today
it
has
become
a
real
and
relevant
question
for
a
whole
class
:
the
question
of
the
inner
transformation
of
the
proletariat
,
of
its
development
to
the
stage
of
its
own
objective
historical
mission
.


It
is
an
ideological
crisis
which
must
be
solved
before
a
practical
solution
to
the
world’s
economic
crisis
can
be
found
.



In
view
of
the
great
distance
that
the
proletariat
has
to
travel
ideologically
it
would
be
disastrous
to
foster
any
illusions
.


But
it
would
be
no
less
disastrous
to
overlook
the
forces
at
work
within
the
proletariat
which
are
tending
towards
the
ideological
defeat
of
capitalism
.


Every
proletarian
revolution
has
created
workers’
councils
in
an
increasingly
radical
and
conscious
manner
.


When
this
weapon
increases
in
power
to
the
point
where
it
becomes
the
organ
of
state
,
this
is
a
sign
that
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
is
on
the
verge
of
overcoming
the
bourgeois
outlook
of
its
leaders
.



The
revolutionary
workers’
council
(not
to
be
confused
with
its
opportunist
caricatures)
is
one
of
the
forms
which
the
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
has
striven
to
create
ever
since
its
inception
.


The
fact
that
it
exists
and
is
constantly
developing
shows
that
the
proletariat
already
stands
on
the
threshold
of
its
own
consciousness
and
hence
on
the
threshold
of
victory
.


The
workers’
council
spells
the
political
and
economic
defeat
of
reification
.


In
the
period
following
the
dictatorship
it
will
eliminate
the
bourgeois
separation
of
the
legislature
,
administration
and
judiciary
.


During
the
struggle
for
control
its
mission
is
twofold
.


On
the
one
hand
,
it
must
overcome
the
fragmentation
of
the
proletariat
in
time
and
space
,
and
on
the
other
,
it
has
to
bring
economics
and
politics
together
into
the
true
synthesis
of
proletarian
praxis
.


In
this
way
it
will
help
to
reconcile
the
dialectical
conflict
between
immediate
interests
and
ultimate
goal
.



Thus
we
must
never
overlook
the
distance
that
separates
the
consciousness
of
even
the
most
revolutionary
worker
from
the
authentic
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
.


But
even
this
situation
can
be
explained
on
the
basis
of
the
Marxist
theory
of
class
struggle
and
class
consciousness
.


The
proletariat
only
perfects
itself
by
annihilating
and
transcending
itself
,
by
creating
the
classless
society
through
the
successful
conclusion
of
its
own
class
struggle
.


The
struggle
for
this
society
,
in
which
the
dictatorship
of
the
proletariat
is
merely
a
phase
,
is
not
just
a
battle
waged
against
an
external
enemy
,
the
bourgeoisie
.


It
is
equally
the
struggle
of
the
proletariat
against
itself
.


against
the
devastating
and
degrading
effects
of
the
capitalist
system
upon
its
class
consciousness
.


The
proletariat
will
only
have
won
the
real
victory
when
it
has
overcome
these
effects
within
itself
.


The
separation
of
the
areas
that
should
be
united
,
the
diverse
stages
of
consciousness
which
the
proletariat
has
reached
in
the
various
spheres
of
activity
are
a
precise
index
of
what
has
been
achieved
and
what
remains
to
be
done
.


The
proletariat
must
not
shy
away
from
self-criticism
,
for
victory
can
only
be
gained
by
the
truth
and
self-criticism
must
,
therefore
,
be
its
natural
element
.

It

Rosa
Luxemburg’s

achievement
to
have
shown
that
this
is
not

a
passing
phase

that
capitalism
can
only
survive-economically-while
it
moves
society
in
the
direction
of
capitalism

has
not

This

self-contradiction

undoubtedly
one
of
the
reasons
for

"Level
of
consciousness"
(LOC)
is
a
medical
term
used
to
describe
how
awake
,
alert
,
and
aware
you
are
.


It
also
refers
to
how
well
you
respond
to
attempts
to
get
your
attention
.


A
person
with
an
altered
level
of
consciousness
may
have
decreased
cognitive
function
or
be
difficult
to
arouse
.



A
variety
of
medical
conditions
and
drugs
can
affect
your
level
of
consciousness
,
from
having
dementia
or
lethargy
to
being
in
a
coma
.


Sometimes
impaired
consciousness
is
reversible
,
while
other
times
it
is
not
.



This
article
covers
normal
and
altered
states
of
consciousness
as
well
as
coma
classifications
.

What
Is
Consciousness
?




Medical
definitions
say
a
normal
LOC
means
a
person
is
either awake
or
can
be
readily
awakened
from
normal
sleep
.


Terms
include
:

-
Consciousness
:
A
state
in
which
a
person
is
awake
,
aware
,
alert
,
and

responsive
to
stimuli
-
Decreased
consciousness
:
A
person
appears
awake
and
aware
of
their

surroundings
(conscious)
but
is
not
responding
normally
(acts

confused
,
odd
,
or
sleepy)
.


-
Unconsciousness
:
A
person
has
a
deficit
in
awareness
and

responsiveness
to
stimuli
(touch
,
light
,
sound)

Sleeping
is
not
considered
unconsciousness
if
waking
up
would
result
in
normal
consciousness
Between
consciousness
and
unconsciousness
there
are
several
altered
levels
,
each
with
its
own
definition
.




Altered
Level
of
Consciousness


Altered
or
abnormal
levels
of
consciousness
are
states
in
which
you
either
have
decreased
cognitive
function
or
cannot
be
easily
aroused
.



Most
medical
conditions
affect
the
brain
and
impair
consciousness
when
they
become
serious
or
life-threatening
.


An
altered
LOC
usually
signals
a
serious
medical
problem
.



Are
You
at
Risk
of
Altered
Level
of
Consciousness
?



If
you
are
at
risk
for
altered
LOC
,
be
sure
to
have
the
proper
medical
precautions
in
place
.


For
example
,
wear
a
medical
alert
bracelet
or
download
a
phone
app
that
lists
your
diagnoses
,
medications
,
and
emergency
contacts
.


Some
apps
can
be
accessed
even
when
your
phone
is
locked
.


You
may
also
want
to
designate
a
healthcare
proxy
to
speak
for
you
if
you
are
unable
.



Often
,
an
altered
LOC
can
deteriorate
rapidly
from
one
stage
to
the
next
.


They
require
timely
diagnosis
and
prompt
treatment
.




Confusion


Confusion
describes
disorientation
that
makes
it
difficult
to

and/or
pupil
response
Severely
diminished
brain
function
,
extreme
blood
loss
,
organ
failure
,

Obtundation


Obtundation
is
reduced
alertness
with
:

-
Slow
responses
to
stimuli
-
Need
of
repeated
stimulation
to
maintain
attention
-
Prolonged
periods
of
sleep
-
Drowsiness
between
these
periods

Causes
can
include
:

-
Poisoning
-
Stroke
-
Brain
edema
(swelling)
-
Sepsis
(a
blood
infection)
-
Advanced
organ
failure


Stupor


Someone
in
a
stupor
responds
minimally
to
vigorous
stimulation
,
such
as
a
pinched
toe
or
light
in
the
eyes
.



Causes
can
include
:

-
Stroke
-
Drug
overdose
-
Lack
of
oxygen
-
Brain
edema
-
Myocardial
infarction
(heart
attack)


Coma


A
person
in
a
coma
does
not
respond
to
any
stimuli
.


Their
pupils
may
not
react
to
light
,
and
they
may
not
have
a
gag
reflex
.



Comas
are
caused
by
severely
diminished
brain
function
.


This
is
usually
due
to
:

-
Stroke
-
Alcohol
poisoning
-
Extreme
hyperglycemia
or
hypoglycemia
-
Extreme
blood
loss
-
Organ
failure
-
Brain
damage
or
infection

What
Is
Myxedema
Coma
?



The
causes
of
altered
LOC
may
overlap
.


For
example
,
the
early
stages
of
brain
edema
or
organ
failure
can
cause
confusion
but
then
advance
rapidly
through
lethargy
,
obtundation
,
stupor
,
and
coma
.




Levels
of
Consciousness
Assessment
Scale


Levels
of
consciousness
can
be
subdivided
into
levels
that
further
clarify
your
degree
of
unresponsiveness
.


That
helps
improve
communication
among
healthcare
providers
as
well
as
aiding
in
research
.



Several
systems
have
been
developed
to
standardize
these
classifications
.


The
most
common
classification
systems
are
:

-
Grady
Coma
Scale
:
Grades
a
coma
from
I
to
V
.


Grady
is
based
on
the

state
of
awareness
and
response
to
stimuli
(e
.

g
.


,
name
being
called
,

light
pain
,
deep
pain)
.


Grade
I
indicates
confusion
,
while
V

indicates
coma
(no
response
to
stimuli)
.


-
Glasgow
Coma
Scale
:
Scores
the
level
of
consciousness
from
1
to
15
,

with
15
being
normal
LOC
.


This
scale
takes
into
account
verbal
,

motor
,
and
eye
responses
to
stimuli
.



Nursing
Assessment
of
LOC

Nurses
may
evaluate
LOC
based
on
the
following
categories
:

-
Alert
:
Opens
eyes
spontaneously
,
looks
at
the
speaker
when
spoken
to

in
a
normal
voice
,
responds
appropriately
to
stimuli
,
and
movements

are
purposeful
-
Lethargic
:
Appears
drowsy
but
opens
eyes
to
loud
verbal
stimuli
.



Looks
at
the
speaker
and
responds
to
questions
before
falling
back

to
sleep
.


-
Obtundation
:
Opens
eyes
with
tactile
stimuli
and
looks
to
the
source

but
responds
slowly
and
may
be
confused
-
Stupor
:
Awakens
only
after
a
painful
stimulus
is
applied
(e
.

g
.


,

applying
pressure
to
the
nailbed)
.


Verbal
responses
are
slow
or

absent
.


Will
fall
into
an
unresponsive
state
when
the
stimulus

stops
.


-
Coma
:
Unarouseable
and
eyes
remain
closed
.


There
are
no
purposeful

responses
to
internal
or
external
stimuli
.


However
,
nonpurposeful

responses
to
painful
stimuli
and
brain
stem
reflexes
may
still
be

present
.




Summary


Levels
of
consciousness
range
from
normal
alertness
and
attention
to
gradations
of
altered
states
,
including
confusion
,
delirium
,
stupor
,
and
coma
.



The
same
conditions
may
produce
mild
to
severe
states
of
altered
LOC
.


Sometimes
,
there
may
be
a
rapid
progression
from
a
mild
to
a
high
stage
.



Coma
scales
can
help
describe
the
exact
level
of
consciousness
.

An
altered
level
of
consciousness
is
any
measure
of
arousal
other
than
normal
.


Level
of
consciousness
(LOC)
is
a
measurement
of
a
person
'
s
arousability
and
responsiveness
to
stimuli
from
the
environment
.

^([1])
A
mildly
depressed
level
of
consciousness
or
alertness
may
be
classed
as
lethargy
;
someone
in
this
state
can
be
aroused
with
little
difficulty
.

^([1])
People
who
are
obtunded
have
a
more
depressed
level
of
consciousness
and
cannot
be
fully
aroused
.

^([1][2])
Those
who
are
not
able
to
be
aroused
from
a
sleep-like
state
are
said
to
be
stuporous
.

^([1][2])
Coma
is
the
inability
to
make
any
purposeful
response
.

^([1][2])
Scales
such
as
the
Glasgow
coma
scale
have
been
designed
to
measure
the
level
of
consciousness
.



An
altered
level
of
consciousness
can
result
from
a
variety
of
factors
,
including
alterations
in
the
chemical
environment
of
the
brain
(e
.

g
.


exposure
to
poisons
or
intoxicants)
,
insufficient
oxygen
or
blood
flow
in
the
brain
,
and
excessive
pressure
within
the
skull
.


Prolonged
unconsciousness
is
understood
to
be
a
sign
of
a
medical
emergency
.

^([3])
A
deficit
in
the
level
of
consciousness
suggests
that
both
of
the
cerebral
hemispheres
or
the
reticular
activating
system
have
been
injured
.

^([4])
A
decreased
level
of
consciousness
correlates
to
increased
morbidity
(sickness)
and
mortality
(death)
.

^([5])
Thus
it
is
a
valuable
measure
of
a
patient
'
s
medical
and
neurological
status
.


In
fact
,
some
sources
consider
level
of
consciousness
to
be
one
of
the
vital
signs
.

Summary
(Kruse)^([2])
Description

Metaconscious
Preternatural
People
who
possess
the
ability
to
monitor
and
control
their
own
cognitive
processes
in
addition
to
meeting
all
the
criteria
indicative
of
a
normal
level
of
consciousness
.


In
the
field
of
cognitive
neuroscience
,
metacognitive
monitoring
and
control
have
been
viewed
as
functions
of
the
prefrontal
cortex
,
which
receives
sensory
input
signals
from
divergent
cortical
regions
and
implements
control
through
feedback
loops
which
are
established
utilizing
the
underlying
mechanisms
of
neuroplasticity
(see
chapters
by
Schwartz
&
Bacon
and
Shimamura
,
in
Dunlosky
&
Bjork
,
2008)
.

^([7])

Conscious
Normal
Assessment
of
LOC
involves
checking
orientation
:
people
who
are
able
promptly
and
spontaneously
to
state
their
name
,
location
,
and
the
date
or
time
are
said
to
be
oriented
to
self
,
place
,
and
time
,
or
"oriented
X3"
.

^([8])
A
normal
sleep
stage
from
which
a
person
is
easily
awakened
is
also
considered
a
normal
level
of
consciousness
.

^([9])
"Clouding
of
consciousness"
is
a
term
for
a
mild
alteration
of
consciousness
with
alterations
in
attention
and
wakefulness
.

^([9])

Confused
Disoriented
;
impaired
thinking
and
responses
People
who
do
not
respond
quickly
with
information
about
their
name
,
location
,
and
the
time
are
considered
"obtuse"
or
"confused"
.

^([8])
A
confused
person
may
be
bewildered
,
disoriented
,
and
have
difficulty
following
instructions
.

^([9])
The
person
may
have
slow
thinking
and
possible
memory
time
loss
.


This
could
be
caused
by
sleep
deprivation
,
malnutrition
,
allergies
,
environmental
pollution
,
drugs
(prescription
and
nonprescription)
,
and
infection
.



Delirious
Disoriented
;
restlessness
,
hallucinations
,
sometimes
delusions
Some
scales
have
"delirious"
below
this
level
,
in
which
a
person
may
be
restless
or
agitated
and
exhibit
a
marked
deficit
in
attention
.

^([2])

Somnolent
Sleepy
A
somnolent
person
shows
excessive
drowsiness
and
responds
to
stimuli
only
with
incoherent
mumbles
or
disorganized
movements
.

^([8])

Obtunded
Decreased
alertness
;
slowed
psychomotor
responses
In
obtundation
,
a
person
has
a
decreased
interest
in
their
surroundings
,
slowed
responses
,
and
sleepiness
.

^([9])

Stuporous
Sleep-like
state
(not
unconscious)
;
little/no
spontaneous
activity
People
with
an
even
lower
level
of
consciousness
,
stupor
,
only
respond
by
grimacing
or
drawing
away
from
painful
stimuli
.

^([8])

Comatose
Cannot
be
aroused
;
no
response
to
stimuli
Comatose
people
do
not
even
make
this
response
to
stimuli
,
have
no
corneal
or
gag
reflex
,
and
they
may
have
no
pupillary
response
to
light
.

Levels

Altered
level
of
consciousness
is
sometimes
described
as
altered

.



Glasgow
Coma
Scale

[edit]

Main
article
:
Glasgow
Coma
Scale

The
most
commonly
used
tool
for
measuring
LOC
objectively
is
the
Glasgow
Coma
Scale
(GCS)
.


It
has
come
into
almost
universal
use
for
assessing
people
with
brain
injury
,^([2])
or
an
altered
level
of
consciousness
.


Verbal
,
motor
,
and
eye-opening
responses
to
stimuli
are
measured
,
scored
,
and
added
into
a
final
score
on
a
scale
of
3–15
,
with
a
lower
score
being
a
more
decreased
level
of
consciousness
.

^([citation
needed])

Others

[edit]

The
AVPU
scale
is
another
means
of
measuring
LOC
:
people
are
assessed
to
determine
whether
they
are
alert
,
responsive
to
verbal
stimuli
,
responsive
to
painful
stimuli
,
or
unresponsive
.

^([3][6])
To
determine
responsiveness
to
voice
,
a
caregiver
speaks
to
,
or
,
failing
that
,
yells
at
the
person
.

^([3])
Responsiveness
to
pain
is
determined
with
a
mild
painful
stimulus
such
as
a
pinch
;
moaning
or
withdrawal
from
the
stimulus
is
considered
a
response
to
pain
.

^([3])
The
ACDU
scale
,
like
AVPU
,
is
easier
to
use
than
the
GCS
and
produces
similarly
accurate
results
.

^([10])
Using
ACDU
,
a
patient
is
assessed
for
alertness
,
confusion
,
drowsiness
,
and
unresponsiveness
.

^([10])

The
Grady
Coma
Scale
classes
people
on
a
scale
of
I
to
V
along
a
scale
of
confusion
,
stupor
,
deep
stupor
,
abnormal
posturing
,
and
coma
.

^([9])

Pathophysiology

[edit]

Although
the
neural
science
behind
alertness
,
wakefulness
,
and
arousal
are
not
fully
known
,
the
reticular
formation
is
known
to
play
a
role
in
these
.

^([9])
The
ascending
reticular
activating
system
is
a
postulated
group
of
neural
connections
that
receives
sensory
input
and
projects
to
the
cerebral
cortex
through
the
midbrain
and
thalamus
from
the
reticular
formation
.

^([9])
Since
this
system
is
thought
to
modulate
wakefulness
and
sleep
,
interference
with
it
,
such
as
injury
,
illness
,
or
metabolic
disturbances
,
could
alter
the
level
of
consciousness
.

^([9])

Normally
,
stupor
and
coma
are
produced
by
interference
with
the
brain
stem
,
such
as
can
be
caused
by
a
lesion
or
indirect
effects
,
such
as
brain
herniation
.

^([9])
Mass
lesions
in
the
brain
stem
normally
cause
coma
due
to
their
effects
on
the
reticular
formation
.

^([11])
Mass
lesions
that
occur
above
the
tentorium
cerebelli
normally
do
not
significantly
alter
the
level
of
consciousness
unless
they
are
very
large
or
affect
both
cerebral
hemispheres
.

^([9])

Diagnosis

[edit]

Assessing
LOC
involves
determining
an
individual
'
s
response
to
external
stimuli
.

^([12])
Speed
and
accuracy
of
responses
to
questions
and
reactions
to
stimuli
such
as
touch
and
pain
are
noted
.

^([12])
Reflexes
,
such
as
the
cough
and
gag
reflexes
,
are
also
means
of
judging
LOC
.

^([12])
Once
the
level
of
consciousness
is
determined
,
clinicians
seek
clues
for
the
cause
of
any
alteration
.

^([9])
Usually
the
first
tests
in
the
ER
are
pulse
oximetry
to
determine
if
there
is
hypoxia
,
serum
glucose
levels
to
rule
out
hypoglycemia
.


A
urine
drug
screen
may
be
sent
.


A
CT
head
is
very
important
to
obtain
to
rule
out
bleed
.


In
cases
where
meningitis
is
suspected
,
a
lumbar
puncture
must
be
performed
.


A
serum
TSH
is
an
important
test
to
order
.


In
select
groups
consider
vitamin
B12
levels
.


Checking
serum
ammonia
is
particularly
advised
in
neonatal
coma
to
discern
inborn
errors
of
metabolism
.

^([citation

Differential
diagnosis

[edit]

A
lowered
level
of
consciousness
indicate
a
deficit
in
brain
function
.

^([4])
Level
of
consciousness
can
be
lowered
when
the
brain
receives
insufficient
oxygen
(as
occurs
in
hypoxia)
;
insufficient
blood
(as
occurs
in
shock
,
in
children
for
example
due
to
intussusception)
;
or
has
an
alteration
in
the
brain
'
s
chemistry
.

^([3])
Conditions
of
the
heart
and
conditions
of
the
lungs
can
alter
consciousness
.


Metabolic
disorders
such
as
diabetes
mellitus
and
uremia
can
alter
consciousness
.

^([12])
Hypo-
or
hypernatremia
(decreased
and
elevated
levels
of
sodium
,
respectively)
as
well
as
dehydration
can
also
produce
an
altered
LOC
.

^([13])
A
pH
outside
of
the
range
the
brain
can
tolerate
will
also
alter
LOC
.

^([9])
Exposure
to
drugs
(e
.

g
.


alcohol)
or
toxins
may
also
lower
LOC
,^([3])
as
may
a
core
temperature
that
is
too
high
or
too
low
(hyperthermia
or
hypothermia)
.


Increases
in
intracranial
pressure
(the
pressure
within
the
skull)
can
also
cause
altered
LOC
.


It
can
result
from
traumatic
brain
injury
such
as
concussion
.

^([12])
Ischemic
stroke
and
brain
bleeding
are
other
causes
of
altered
consciousness
.

^([12])
Infections
of
the
central
nervous
system
may
also
be
associated
with
decreased
LOC
;
for
example
,
an
altered
LOC
is
the
most
common
symptom
of
encephalitis
.

^([14])
Neoplasms
within
the
intracranial
cavity
can
also
affect
consciousness
,^([12])
as
can
epilepsy
and
post-seizure
states
.

^([9])
A
decreased
LOC
can
also
result
from
a
combination
of
factors
.

^([12])
A
concussion
,
which
is
a
mild
traumatic
brain
injury
(MTBI)
may
result
in
decreased
LOC
.

^([citation
needed])

Treatment

[edit]

Treatment
depends
on
the
degree
of
decrease
in
consciousness
and
its
underlying
cause
.


Initial
treatment
often
involves
the
administration
of
dextrose
if
the
blood
sugar
is
low
as
well
as
the
administration
of
oxygen
,
naloxone
and
thiamine
.

When
documenting
your
patient’s
level
of
consciousness
,
you’ll
notice
you
have
a
LOT
of
options
to
choose
from
.


Your
patient
can
be
alert
,
confused
,
in
a
coma
and
anything
in
between
.


Knowing
the
difference
between
each
level
of
consciousness
will
help
you
chart
accurately
and
communicate
your
patient’s
condition
with
precision
.


The
different
levels
of
consciousness
are
:

-
Alert
:
awake
and
responsive
-
Confused
:
note
that
confusion
can
occur
anywhere
along
this
spectrum

and
is
not
always
present
prior
to
the
patient
becoming
somnolent
,

lethargic
,
etc…
It
is
possible
to
have
a
patient
who
is
somnolent
or

even
lethargic
and
still
oriented
.


-
Somnolent
:
sleepy
-
Lethargic
:
very
drowsy
,
falls
asleep
in
between
care
-
Obtunded
:
difficult
to
arouse
-
Stuporous
:
very
difficult
to
arouse
-
Unresponsive/Coma
:
unarousable

Describing
your
patient’s
LOC
correctly
is
especially
important
when
there
are
acute
changes
in
condition
.


For
example
,
I
had
a
patient
recently
who
was
stuporous
upon
arrival
to
the
ICU
,
but
quickly
became
unresponsive
,
requiring
immediate
intervention
in
order
to
keep
the
patient
safe
.


Had
I
not
known
how
to
describe
this
patient’s
level
of
consciousness
using
standardized
language
,
there
could
have
been
a
huge
miscommunication
between
me
and
the
MD
.


So
,
let’s
go
through
a
quick
example
using
an
entirely
fictitious
patient
.


Ready
?



[]

In
report
you
learn
the
following
about
your
patient
:
56
year
old
female
with
CKD
stage
4
,
CHF
,
DM2
,
and
hyperlipidemia
.


BIBA
yesterday
for
SOB
,
currently
on
6L
oxygen
.


BP
110/68
,
HR
77
,
O2
sat
94%
,
afebrile
.


Urine
output
minimal
overnight
at
20
ml/hr
,
dark
and
concentrated
.


Chemistry
panel
shows
mild
hyperkalemia
,
elevated
BUN
and
Creatinine
,
mildly
anemic
with
Hbg
9
.

2
and
WBC
WDL
.



At
the
time
of
your
initial
assessment
at
0800
,
you
note
that
the
patient
opens
her
eyes
spontaneously
and
responds
to
questions
though
not
all
her
answers
make
sense
.


She
will
follow
simple
one-step
commands
,
but
when
you
ask
her
to
do
more
than
one
thing
at
a
time
,
she
does
not
always
follow
through
.


You
ask
your
patient
where
she
is
right
now
and
she
answers
“in
my
living
room
.

”
At
this
time
,
your
patient
is
ALERT
and
CONFUSED
.



At
0900
,
you
bring
in
your
patient’s
medications
.


She
wakes
easily
to
voice
but
yawns
a
few
times
and
states
she
just
wants
to
sleep
.


At
this
point
your
patient
is
SOMNOLENT
.



At
1000
, 
you
go
in
to
help
your
patient
get
repositioned
when
you
notice
she
opens
eyes
only
to
voice
or
stimulation
(not
spontaneously)
.


She
follows
some
basic
commands
,
and
is
slow
to
respond
.


She
drifts
off
again
once
no
longer
stimulated
.


Your
patient
is
now
LETHARGIC
.



At
1200
,
your
patient
is
more
difficult
to
arouse
.


Her
responses
are
delayed
and
minimal
.


She
does
not
appear
to
fully
wake
when
stimulated
and
she
immediately
goes
back
to
sleep
when
not
stimulated
.


When
she
does
answer
questions
,
she
mumbles
and
is
clearly
confused
.


At
this
time
she
is
OBTUNDED
.



By
1300
,
your
patient
can
only
be
aroused
by
vigorous
and
repeated
stimulation
.


When
the
stimulation
stops
she
immediately
lapses
back
into
her
unresponsive
state
.


The
only
vocalizations
she
makes
are
moans
.


She
is
now
in
a
STUPOR
.



At
1400
,
your
patient
is
unarousable
to
any
stimulation
,
even
vigorous
and
painful
stimuli
.


At
this
point
she
is
UNRESPONSIVE
or
COMATOSE
.



Of
course
,
you’ve
been
updating
the
MD
on
your
patient’s
changes
in
LOC
all
morning
,
and
you
have
both
ensured
that
the
appropriate
interventions
have
been
instituted
.


In
a
case
with
patient
with
renal
disease
,
you
will
often
see
them
have
decreasing
levels
of
consciousness
as
their
pH
drops
secondary
to
their
metabolic
acidosis
.


With
a
patient
like
this
,
you
might
anticipate
the
MD
ordering
an
ABG
at
some
point…don’t
be
surprised
if
it
comes
back
acidotic
.


Typically
what
happens
is
the
patient
will
receive
dialysis
and
as
things
start
to
come
back
into
balance
the
patient
becomes
more
alert
(assuming
they
don’t
have
any
other
underlying
physiologic
derangements
such
as
sepsis
.

)

The
other
common
situation
this
occurs
in
is
COPD
exacerbation
.


The
pH
will
decrease
as
the
CO2
increases
.


As
the
CO2
rises
,
the
patient
becomes
more
and
more
comatose…usually
we
can
pull
the
patient
out
of
it
with
BIPAP
,
but
in
extreme
cases
they
may
be
intubated
.


You’ll
see
this
over
and
over
and
over
again…especially
if
you
work
in
a
medical
ICU
or
telemetry
unit
.



This
whole
topic
of
consciousness
is
so
incredibly
interesting
,
especially
as
it
relates
to
anesthesia
.


If
you’re
interested
in
getting
your
CRNA
someday
,
you
might
find
this
article
fascinating…I
know
I
certainly
did
!


Enjoy
!

consciousness
,
a
psychological
condition
defined
by
the
English
philosopher
John
Locke
as
“the
perception
of
what
passes
in
a
man’s
own
mind
.

”

(Read

Harari’s

Early
views

In
the
early
19th
century
the
concept
was
variously
considered
.


Some
philosophers
regarded
it
as
a
kind
of
substance
,
or
“mental
stuff
,”
quite
different
from
the
material
substance
of
the
physical
world
.


Others
thought
of
it
as
an
attribute
characterized
by
sensation
and
voluntary
movement
,
which
separated
animals
and
men
from
lower
forms
of
life
and
also
described
the
difference
between
the
normal
waking
state
of
animals
and
men
and
their
condition
when
asleep
,
in
a
coma
,
or
under
anesthesia
(the
latter
condition
was
described
as
unconsciousness)
.


Other
descriptions
included
an
analysis
of
consciousness
as
a
form
of
relationship
or
act
of
the
mind
toward
objects
in
nature
,
and
a
view
that
consciousness
was
a
continuous
field
or
stream
of
essentially
mental
“sense
data
,”
roughly
similar
to
the
“ideas”
of
earlier
empirical
philosophers
.

Altered
consciousness

The
method
employed
by
most
early
writers
in
observing
consciousness
was
introspection—looking
within
one’s
own
mind
to
discover
the
laws
of
its
operation
.


The
limitations
of
the
method
became
apparent
when
it
was
found
that
because
of
differing
preconceptions
,
trained
observers
in
the
laboratory
often
could
not
agree
on
fundamental
observations
.



The
behaviourist
view

The
failure
of
introspection
to
reveal
consistent
laws
led
to
the
rejection
of
all
mental
states
as
proper
subjects
of
scientific
study
.


In
behaviourist
psychology
,
derived
primarily
from
work
of
the
American
psychologist
John
B
.


Watson
in
the
early
1900s
,
the
concept
of
consciousness
was
irrelevant
to
the
objective
investigation
of
human
behaviour
and
was
doctrinally
ignored
in
research
.


Neobehaviourists
,
however
,
adopted
a
more
liberal
posture
toward
mentalistic
states
such
as
consciousness
.



Neurophysiological
mechanisms

That
consciousness
depends
on
the
function
of
the
brain
has
been
known
from
ancient
times
.


Although
detailed
understanding
of
the
neural
mechanisms
of
consciousness
has
not
been
achieved
,
correlations
between
states
of
consciousness
and
functions
of
the
brain
are
possible
.


Levels
of
consciousness
in
terms
of
levels
of
alertness
or
responsiveness
are
correlated
with
patterns
of
electrical
activity
of
the
brain
(brain
waves)
recorded
by
an
electroencephalograph
.


During
wide-awake
consciousness
the
pattern
of
brain
waves
consists
of
rapid
irregular
waves
of
low
amplitude
or
voltage
.


In
contrast
,
during
sleep
,
when
consciousness
can
be
said
to
be
minimal
,
the
brain
waves
are
much
slower
and
of
greater
amplitude
,
often
coming
in
periodic
bursts
of
slow
waxing
and
waning
amplitude
.



Both
behavioral
levels
of
consciousness
and
the
correlated
patterns
of
electrical
activity
are
related
to
the
function
of
a
part
of
the
brainstem
called
the
reticular
formation
.


Electrical
stimulation
of
the
ascending
reticular
systems
arouses
a
sleeping
cat
to
alert
consciousness
and
simultaneously
activates
its
brain
waves
to
the
waking
pattern
.

It
was
once
supposed
that
the
neurophysiological
mechanisms
subserving
consciousness
and
the
higher
mental
processes
must
reside
in
the
cortex
.


It
is
more
likely
,
however
,
that
the
cortex
serves
the
more
specialized
functions
of
integrating
patterns
of
sensory
experience
and
organizing
motor
patterns
and
that
the
ascending
reticular
system
represents
the
neural
structures
most
critically
related
to
consciousness
.


The
brainstem
reticular
formation
should
not
,
however
,
be
called
the
seat
of
consciousness
.


It
represents
an
integrative
focus
,
functioning
through
its
widespread
interconnections
with
the
cortex
and
other
regions
of
the
brain
.

false
consciousness
,
in
philosophy
,
particularly
within
critical
theory
and
other
Marxist
schools
and
movements
,
the
notion
that
members
of
the
proletariat
unwittingly
misperceive
their
real
position
in
society
and
systematically
misunderstand
their
genuine
interests
within
the
social
relations
of
production
under
capitalism
.


False
consciousness
denotes
people’s
inability
to
recognize
inequality
,
oppression
,
and
exploitation
in
a
capitalist
society
because
of
the
prevalence
within
it
of
views
that
naturalize
and
legitimize
the
existence
of
social
classes
.



Despite
its
close
assocation
with
Marxism
,
the
term
false
consciousness
was
never
used
by
Karl
Marx
.


The
first
treatment
of
false
consciousness
as
a
theoretical
concept
occurred
in
History
and
Class
Consciousness
(1923)
by
the
Hungarian
philosopher
and
literary
critic
György
Lukács
.


The
concept
was
further
developed
in
the
20th
century
by
Marxist
scholars
such
as
the
German-born
American
philosopher
Herbert
Marcuse
and
the
French
sociologist
Henri
Lefebvre
.


Since
the
late
20th
century
the
concept
has
been
utilized
outside
explicitly
Marxist
theorizing
in
studies
of
oppression
on
the
basis
of
gender
,
sexual
orientation
,
ethnicity
,
and
race
.

Bad
conscience
and
guilt
:
Gaining
understanding
and
treatment

A
guilty
conscience
can
be
a
result
of
various
psychological
mechanisms
.


In
this
article
we
present
an
overview
of
some
of
them
,
what
you
yourself
can
do
and
what
you
can
expect
if
you
contact
us
for
therapy
.

 

We
hope
we
can
contribute
a
step
in
the
right
direction
-
free
from
the
guilt
trap
.

 

No
one
is
perfect
on
every
level
and
everything
can
always
be
handled
better
.


Thus
,
a
feeling
of
guilt
is
unavoidable
for
any
sentient
being
.


But
for
some
it
can
prove
to
be
extra
burdensome
.



In

A
guilty
conscience
-
an
introduction

A
guilty
conscience
must
be
the
most
misused
of
our
basic
emotions
.


It
is
actually
a
feeling
that
can
help
guide
us
back
to
the
right
path
when
we
have
actually
done
something
wrong
.



But
in
our
time
,
it
is
largely
abused
as
a
tool
for
psychological
warfare
on
ourselves
.



When
we
speak
of
a
guilty
conscience
,
we
must
therefore
immediately
separate
between
healthy
and
unhealthy
feelings
of
guilt
.



We
can
get
a
healthy
feeling
of
guilt
simply
because
we
have
done
something
wrong
.


In
these
instances
,
the
feeling
of
guilt
is
meant
to
help
motivate
us
to
engage
in
reparative
actions
.

 

All
too
often
,
a
temporary
guilty
conscience
is
an
unhealthy
expression
of
self-punishment
.


Often
over
not
being
able
to
meet
impossible
inner
demands
and
expectations
.

 

Imagination
is
the
only
limitation
for
which
parts
of
reality
one
can
abuse
to
keep
oneself
down
.



Bad
conscience
for
having
eaten
,
not
to
mention
eating
candy
or
something
else
unhealthy
,
not
have
trained
,
after
a
breakup
,
to
end
it
,
not
to
stay
in
the
relationship
,
with
your
boyfriend
,
ex
,
children
and
parents
,
not
least
if
they
are
old
.


It
can
happen
if
you
are
ill
,
away
from
work
or
have
infected
others
.


One
may
have
a
bad
conscience
for
saying
no
,
or
for
not
saying
no
.


It
can
also
occur
over
thoughts
and
feelings
one
has
.


In
cohabitation
,
it
can
occur
after
infidelity
,
or
for
lack
of
and
too
much
sex
drive
.



There
is
almost
no
way
,
and
can
be
a
great
challenge
in
everyday
life
.



Trapped
in
the
maelstrom
of
the
spirit
of
the
times
?



How
can
it
have
become
so
common
to
go
around
feeling
like
you
are
never
enough
?


Why
can
'
t
we
give
ourselves
permission
to
be
as
we
are
,
to
just
live
life
in
all
our
human
imperfection
?



Why
can
we
sometimes
see
the
irrationality
of
our
self-accusations
but
still
be
unable
to
shed
the
painful
emotions
?



You
may
have
come
across
various
advice
and
tips
online
already
.


“Tell
yourself
you
are
good
enough”
,
“lower
your
standards”
or
similar
expressions
are
often
employed
.


These
are
completely
right
and
in
some
cases
reminders
such
as
these
can
be
of
help
.


  

But
sometimes
you
may
not
be
aware
that
you
are
driving
yourself
far
too
hard
.


Things
may
have
always
been
this
way
and
you
don’t
even
think
about
it
.



Fish
don’t
believe
in
water
.



In
situations
like
these
,
awareness
and
active
work
with
your
inner
dialogue
can
be
enough
to
create
more
space
within
yourself
.



This
can
be
especially
true
for
those
who
have
a
somewhat
healthy
sense
of
self-esteem
at
their
foundation
but
find
themselves
being
drawn
into
the
“hamster-wheel”
,
stuck
in
time
constraints
and
the
eternal
demands
of
modern
life
.

 

Chronic
guilt
-
for
no
reason
?



In
many
cases
we
find
that
the
problem
goes
deeper
.


A
chronic
guilty
conscience
,
often
for
no
reason
,
is
commonly
linked
with
a
vulnerability
in
an
individual’s
self-esteem
.

 

Rationally
you
can
understand
that
you
are
too
hard
on
yourself
,
but
it
feels
like
you
just
aren
'
t
good
enough
and
should
step
it
up
anyway
.

 

When
things
feel
like
this
there
is
an
emotional
block
in
place
somewhere
,
often
unconsciously
.



In
situations
such
as
these
,
therapy
can
be
helpful
in
getting
to
the
bottom
of
what
the
driving
force
behind
the
difficulties
is
and
attempt
to
weaken
the
inner
mechanisms
of
self-sabotage

Preferably
pulled
up
by
the
root
.



Psychologists
as
early
as
Freud
were
preoccupied
with
the
central
role
an
indeterminate
feeling
of
guilt
can
play
.



Once
such
a
feeling
has
first
entered
the
psyche
,
it
can
become
a
driving
force
for
a
variety
of
symptoms
,
including
anxiety
and
depression
.



The
mind
can
become
preoccupied
with
seeking
out
confirmations
in
everyday
situations
of
such
basic
assumptions
.



Thus
,
chronic
feelings
of
guilt
in
everyday
life
can
begin
not
only
in
the
maelstrom
of
the
times
but
also
in
disturbed
internalized
relational
experiences
from
childhood
.



This
does
not
necessarily
have
to
mean
great
traumas
;
often
the
driving
force
is
a
more
subtle
,
emotional
tension
.



The
child
who
grows
up
with
suffering
around
them
develops
basic
feelings
of
guilt
for
their
own
inability
to
help
.



The
child
who
does
not
have
their
negative
feelings
towards
others
acknowledged
will
still
feel
cruel
and
guilty
and
continue
to
direct
such
feelings
inward
.



Other
times
the
induction
of
guilt
can
occur
via
various
forms
of
conditional
love
,
such
as
high
expectations
and
demands
.



Sometimes
difficulties
with
guilt
can
be
rooted
in
growing
up
with
more
or
less
direct
accusations
,
criticism
and
disapproval
.


Among
other
things
.



One
is
often
unaware
that
such
basic
conditions
can
become
the
driving
force
for
chronic
guilt
,
and
simply
becoming
aware
of
this
can
help
.



Other
times
one
is
aware
but
driven
by
chronic
guilt
just
the
same
.



In
situations
such
as
these
,
emotion-focused
therapy
,
where
you
work
through
layers
of
anxiety
and
guilt-containing
emotions
(especially
repressed
anger)
can
be
an
effective
means
of
breaking
the
pattern
.



In
our
experience
,
a
lot
of
anxiety
and
guilt
are
connected
to
contradictory
emotions
related
to
figures
central
in
one’s
upbringing
.



In
some
cases
,
adaptation
to
one
'
s
environment
goes
so
far
as
to
become
purely
self-destructive
.



Simply
saying
no
or
having
an
opinion
,
want
,
thought
or
feeling
that
conflicts
with
the
needs
of
others
can
create
a
feeling
of
guilt
.



Then
therapy
with
a
psychologist
can
often
be
necessary
.


If
you
wish
to
give
therapy
for
a
guilty
conscience
a
try
,
you
can
quickly
and
easily
schedule
an
appointment
online
in

minutes

Therapy
for
a
guilty
conscience
with
trained
psychologists
in
Oslo

If
you
at
any
time
want
to
give
therapy
a
go
,
we
will
begin
by
examining
your
problems
as
you
experience
them
here
and
now
and
work
with
concrete
examples
from
your
everyday
life
in
which
guilt
,
or
other
symptoms
,
are
intensified
.



These
concrete
examples
often
carry
within
them
a
larger
narrative
.


We
will
actively
work
to
understand
the
specific
driving
mechanisms
behind
your
symptoms
,
not
least
of
all
the
unconscious
ones
.



Often
through
this
sort
of
work
,
relevant
links
to
the
past
can
come
up
and
when
this
happens
we
work
closely
with
these
as
well
.



We
endeavor
to
not
just
“talk
about
it”
or
“dwell
on
the
past”
but
to
work
actively
to
help
you
form
a
healing
relationship
where
you
can
be
yourself
and
you
can
react
as
an
entire
organism
to
what
you
have
experienced
.



Thus
,
you
can
resolve
eventual
remnants
from
your
past
that
have
gotten
“stuck”
,
become
aware
of
your
patterns
and
achieve
lasting
change
going
forward
.



This
is
how
we
endeavor
to
combine
an
in-depth
psychological
perspective
with
an
active
work
method
.


We
try
not
to
dig
up
the
past
just
for
the
sake
of
it
while
not
just
superficially
skimming
the
surface
.



The
degree
to
which
your
self-liberation
process
is
successful
is
greatly
dependent
on
the
cooperation
we
manage
to
establish
.



Gaining
a
common
understanding
for
the
mechanisms
that
have
led
to
your
difficulties
and
finding
a
helpful
way
to
cooperate
are
our
natural
goals
at
the
start
of
therapy
.

 

You
will
quickly
discover
if
therapy
is
something
for
you
.


Keep
in
mind
that
we
also
offer
video
therapy
right
in
your
own
home
.


It
can
be
worth
trying
.

of
tips
to
separate

?


Psychological
first
aid
for

of
you
who
have
actually
done
something
wrong -
This
article
is
primarily
about
cases
where
you
have
actually
done
something
wrong
,
have
guilt
healthy
varietybut
misuse
this
in
order
to
punish
yourself
rather
than
reach
out
to
others
.



Then
you
will
never
be
using
the
healthy
feeling
of
guilt
to
bring
yourself
back
on
the
course
you
want
to
be
on
.


Rather
,
you
get
“stuck”
in
the
bad
things
you
have
done
and
use
it
to
keep
yourself
down
.



It
is
helpful
to
do
a
team
effort
and
utilize
your
healthy
capacity
for
guilt
.

About

?


This
is
How
to
Break
the
Pattern
of
the
“Blame
Game” This
blog
post
is
about
when
someone
"gives
you"
guilt
.


When
someone
around
you
has
put
you
,
or
is
constantly
putting
you
,
under
pressure
to
take
responsibility
for
things
that
are
not
really
yours
,
and
you
give
in
.

 

Did
you
have
parents
who
constantly
“gave”
you
a
guilty
conscience
?


Either
directly
or
subtly
,
through
accusations
or
hints
about
their
own
pain
?


Someone
around
you
that
constantly
plays
the
role
of
“victim”
?

 

Or
maybe
a
partner
that
has
started
to
pick
on
you
and
criticize
you
daily
?


And
you
have
started
to
believe
that
it
actually
is
about
YOU
?


Then
this
blog
post
may
prove
helpful
.



Many
people
have
difficulties
believing
that
a
psychologist
can
help
specifically
them
.


Others
have
tried
without
getting
results
.



Remember
that
we
are
experts
in
our
field
with
many
years
of
continued
education
.


We
are
accustomed
to
helping
people
who
have
previously
not
gotten
much
out
of
therapy
.



You
will
quickly
find
out
if
this
is
something
for
you
.


We
do
not
think
you
will
regret
giving
it
a
try
.

The
word
consciousness
is
used
in
a
variety
of
ways
that
need
to
be
distinguished
.


Sometimes
the
word
means
merely
any
human
mental
activity
at
all
(as
when
one
talks
about
the
“history
of
consciousness”)
,
and
sometimes
it
means
merely
being
awake
(as
in
As
the
anesthetic
wore
off
,
the
animal
regained
consciousness)
.


The
most
philosophically
troublesome
usage
concerns
phenomena
with
which
people
seem
to
be
“directly
acquainted”—as
the
British
philosopher
Bertrand
Russell
(1872–1970)
described
them—each
in
his
own
case
.


Each
person
seems
to
have
direct
,
immediate
knowledge
of
his
own
conscious
sensations
and
of
the
contents
of
his
propositional
attitudes—what
he
consciously
thinks
,
believes
,
desires
,
hopes
,
fears
,
and
so
on
.


In
common
philosophical
parlance
,
a
person
is
said
to
have
“incorrigible”
(or
uncorrectable)
access
to
his
own
mental
states
.


For
many
people
,
the
existence
of
these
conscious
states
in
their
own
case
is
more
obvious
and
undeniable
than
anything
else
in
the
world
.


Indeed
,
the
French
mathematician
and
philosopher
René
Descartes
(1596–1650)
regarded
his
immediate
conscious
thoughts
as
the
basis
of
all
of
the
rest
of
his
knowledge
.


Views
that
emphasize
this
first-person
immediacy
of
conscious
states
have
consequently
come
to
be
called
“Cartesian
.

”

It
turns
out
to
be
surprisingly
difficult
to
say
much
about
consciousness
that
is
not
highly
controversial
.


Initial
efforts
in
the
19th
century
to
approach
psychology
with
the
rigour
of
other
experimental
sciences
led
researchers
to
engage
in
careful
introspection
of
their
own
mental
states
.


Although
there
emerged
some
interesting
results
regarding
the
relation
of
certain
sensory
states
to
external
stimulation—for
example
,
laws
proposed
by
Gustav
Theodor
Fechner
(1801–87)
that
relate
the
apparent
to
the
real
amplitude
of
a
sound—much
of
the
research
dissolved
into
vagaries
and
complexities
of
experience
that
varied
greatly
over
different
individuals
and
about
which
interesting
generalizations
were
not
forthcoming
.



It
is
worth
pausing
over
some
of
the
difficulties
of
introspection
and
the
consequent
pitfalls
of
thinking
of
conscious
processes
as
the
central
subject
matter
of
psychology
.


While
it
can
seem
natural
to
think
that
all
mental
phenomena
are
accessible
to
consciousness
,
close
attention
to
the
full
range
of
cases
suggests
otherwise
.


The
Austrian-born
British
philosopher
Ludwig
Wittgenstein
(1889–1951)
was
particularly
adept
at
calling
attention
to
the
rich
and
subtle
variety
of
ordinary
mental
states
and
to
how
little
they
lend
themselves
to
the
model
of
an
introspectively
observed
object
.


In
a
typical
passage
from
his
later
writings
(Zettel
,
§§484–504)
,
he
asked
:


Is
it
hair-splitting
to
say
:
—joy
,
enjoyment
,
delight
,
are
not

sensations
?


—Let
us
at
least
ask
ourselves
:
How
much
analogy
is
there

between
delight
and
what
we
call
“sensation”
?


“I
feel
great
joy”

—Where
?


—that
sounds
like
nonsense
.


And
yet
one
does
say
“I
feel
a

joyful
agitation
in
my
breast
.

”
—But
why
is
joy
not
localized
?


Is
it

because
it
is
distributed
over
the
whole
body
?


…
Love
is
not
a

feeling
.


Love
is
put
to
the
test
,
pain
not
.


One
does
not
say
:
“That

was
not
true
pain
,
or
it
would
not
have
gone
off
so
quickly
.

”

In
a
related
vein
,
the
American
linguist
Ray
Jackendoff
proposed
that
one
is
never
directly
conscious
of
abstract
ideas
,
such
as
goodness
and
justice—they
are
not
items
in
the
stream
of
consciousness
.


At
best
,
one
is
aware
of
the
perceptual
qualities
one
might
associate
with
such
ideas—for
example
,
an
image
of
someone
acting
in
a
kindly
way
.


While
it
can
seem
that
there
is
something
right
in
such
suggestions
,
it
also
seems
to
be
immensely
difficult
to
determine
exactly
what
the
truth
might
be
on
the
basis
of
introspection
alone
.



In
the
late
20th
century
,
the
validity
and
reliability
of
introspection
were
subject
to
much
experimental
study
.


In
an
influential
review
of
the
literature
on
“self-attribution
,”
the
American
psychologists
Richard
Nisbett
and
Timothy
Wilson
discussed
a
wide
range
of
experiments
that
showed
that
people
are
often
demonstrably
mistaken
about
their
own
psychological
processes
.


For
example
,
in
problem-solving
tasks
,
people
are
often
sensitive
to
crucial
clues
of
which
they
are
quite
unaware
,
and
they
often
provide
patently
confabulated
accounts
of
the
problem-solving
methods
they
actually
employ
.


Nisbett
and
Wilson
speculated
that
in
many
cases
introspection
may
not
involve
privileged
access
to
one’s
own
mental
states
but
rather
the
imposition
upon
oneself
of
popular
theories
about
what
mental
states
a
person
in
one’s
situation
is
likely
to
have
.


This
possibility
should
be
considered
seriously
when
evaluating
many
of
the
traditional
claims
about
the
alleged
incorrigibility
of
people’s
access
to
their
own
minds
.



In
any
event
,
it
is
important
to
note
that
not
all
mental
phenomena
are
conscious
.


Indeed
,
the
existence
of
unconscious
mental
states
has
been
recognized
in
the
West
since
the
time
of
the
ancient
Greeks
.


Obvious
examples
include
the
beliefs
,
long-range
plans
,
and
desires
that
a
person
is
not
consciously
thinking
about
at
a
particular
time
,
as
well
as
things
that
have
“slipped
one’s
mind
,”
though
they
must
in
some
way
still
be
there
,
since
one
can
be
reminded
of
them
.


Plato
thought
that
the
kinds
of
a
priori
reasoning
typically
used
in
mathematics
and
geometry
involve
the
“recollection”
(anamnesis)
of
temporarily
forgotten
thoughts
from
a
previous
life
.


Modern
followers
of
Sigmund
Freud
(1856–1939)
have
argued
that
a
great
many
ordinary
parapraxes
(or
“Freudian
slips”)
are
the
result
of
deeply
repressed
unconscious
thoughts
and
desires
.


And
,
as
noted
above
,
many
experiments
reveal
myriad
ways
in
which
people
are
unaware
of
,
and
sometimes
demonstrably
mistaken
about
,
the
character
of
their
mental
processes
,
which
are
therefore
unconscious
at
least
at
the
time
they
occur
.



Partly
out
of
frustration
with
introspectionism
,
psychologists
during
the
first
half
of
the
20th
century
tended
to
ignore
consciousness
entirely
and
instead
study
only
“objective
behaviour”
(see
below
Radical
behaviourism)
.


In
the
last
decades
of
the
century
,
psychologists
began
to
turn
their
attention
once
again
to
consciousness
and
introspection
,
but
their
methods
differed
radically
from
those
of
early
introspectionists
,
in
ways
that
can
be
understood
against
the
background
of
other
issues
.



One
might
wonder
what
makes
an
unconscious
mental
process
“mental”
at
all
.


If
a
person
does
not
have
immediate
knowledge
of
it
,
why
is
it
not
merely
part
of
the
purely
physical
machinery
of
the
brain
?


Why
bring
in
mentality
at
all
?


Accessibility
to
consciousness
,
however
,
is
not
the
only
criterion
for
determining
whether
a
given
state
or
process
is
mental
.


One
alternative
criterion
is
that
mental
states
and
processes
enter
into
the
rationality
of
the
systems
of
which
they
are
a
part
.

Good
Monday
morning
,
and
thank
you
for
listening
today
.


We
begin
the
week
with
a
really
sharp
and
robust
question
from
a
listener
named
Arnaldo
.


Here
it
is
:
“Hello
,
Tony
and
Pastor
John
.


Thank
you
for
your
labors
on
this
podcast
!


My
question
is
one
that
I
have
struggled
with
for
over
two
decades
now
.


It’s
this
:
How
can
I
live
with
a
good
conscience
?


The
apostle
Paul
often
talks
about
the
conscience
,
and
how
specifically
a
‘good
conscience’
is
something
he
always
lived
with
,
apparently
even
before
he
became
a
Christian
(Acts
23
:1
;
24
:16)
.


We
also
see
that
a
‘good
conscience’
is
a
qualification
for
Christian
leaders
(1
Timothy
3
:9)
.


And
having
a
‘good
conscience’
is
an
important
goal
of
the
Christian
life
for
all
believers
(1
Timothy
1
:5
,
19)
.



“When
I
read
the
way
Paul
uses
the
word
conscience
in
these
contexts
,
it
seems
like
he’s
saying
it
means
to
be
‘presently
walking
in
obedience
to
everything
God
has
revealed
to
him
.

’
He
does
not
seem
to
mean
that
he’s
trusting
in
Christ’s
blood
to
cover
over
his
indwelling
sin
.


I
believe
in
both
the
doctrine
of
indwelling
sin
and
of
progressive
sanctification
(according
to
texts
like
Proverbs
4
:18
and
Romans
7
:21–23)
.


God
is
always
revealing
to
me
new
areas
,
and
sometimes
old
areas
,
where
I
need
to
grow
in
holiness
.


These
are
very
real
sin
issues
that
I
can’t
simply
stop
doing
,
like
turning
off
a
light
switch
.


These
are
ones
in
which
I
am
engaged
in
a
long-term
,
ongoing
struggle
and
fight
.


So
I
pray
daily
for
forgiveness
(according
to
1
John
1
:8–10
and
Matthew
6
:12)
.



“All
this
means
that
I
literally
never
have
a
good
conscience
—
I
am
always
aware
of
important
ways
in
which
I
presently
need
to
repent
and
become
more
holy
.


So
if
a
good
conscience
is
a
basic
Christian
issue
,
and
Paul
always
had
one
,
yet
I
will
always
know
of
sin
areas
in
my
life
—
and
if
I
have
to
pray
daily
for
forgiveness
—
how
could
I
,
or
any
Christian
for
that
matter
,
ever
attain
to
a
good
conscience
?

”

Well
,
Arnaldo
has
done
his
homework
.


He
laid
out
texts
in
that
question
,
as
I
hear
it
,
that
contain
all
the
pieces
.


I’ve
got
a
few
to
add
that
might
take
a
little
turn
.


Wow
,
he’s
not
winging
it
here
in
asking
that
question
.


If
there’s
a
solution
,
and
I
do
believe
there
is
,
it’s
probably
found
inside
those
texts
that
he
was
just
commenting
on
,
but
maybe
drawing
some
inferences
from
them
that
were
not
necessarily
accurate
.



Sin
That
Dwells
Within

I
feel
the
force
of
the
question
.


Experientially
,
walking
in
a
good
conscience
is
not
easy
for
me
since
I
share
Arnaldo’s
deep
awareness
of
my
ongoing
,
indwelling
sin
.


That’s
Paul’s
term
in
Romans
7
:17
,
20
,
23
.


We
all
have
remaining
corruption
and
indwelling
sin
.


The
more
keenly
you
are
aware
of
that
,
the
more
you
will
feel
embattled
at
the
level
of
needing
a
good
conscience
.




“The
whole
New
Testament
does
assume
that
in
this
life
,
nobody
attains

sinless
perfection
.

”

I
get
it
.


I
mean
,
I
think
that’s
a
serious
question
.


The
whole
New
Testament
does
assume
that
in
this
life
,
nobody
attains
sinless
perfection
.


We
need
to
just
settle
that
.


That’s
one
of
the
premises
.


Nobody
attains
sinless
perfection
in
this
life
.



Jesus
said
that
we
would
pray
,
“Forgive
us
our
debts”
right
after
,
“Give
us
this
day
our
daily
bread”
(Matthew
6
:11–12)
.


They
go
together
.


Every
day
,
say
both
of
those
.


Paul
said
,
“Not
that
I
have
already
attained
[perfection]
,
but
I
press
on
to
make
it
my
own”
(Philippians
3
:12)
.


He
referred
to
the
sin
that
dwells
in
him
and
cried
out
in
dismay
,
“Who
will
deliver
me
from
this
body
of
death
?

”
(Romans
7
:24)
.


Jesus
pointed
to
the
publican
who
said
,
“God
,
be
merciful
to
me
,
a
sinner
!

”
over
against
the
Pharisee
who
was
thanking
God
that
he
had
such
a
clear
conscience
—
and
he
said
that
the
one
who
cried
out
for
mercy
about
his
sin
went
down
to
his
house
justified
(Luke
18
:10–14)
.


It
was
good
for
him
to
own
his
sinfulness
,
not
to
say
,
“Oh
,
it
doesn’t
exist
.


I’ve
got
a
clear
conscience
.


I
don’t
have
any
sin
to
repent
of
.

”
We
feel
the
force
.



Now
,
I
think
1
John
1
is
not
only
especially
illuminating
but
gives
us
a
category
alongside
good
conscience
that
may
provide
the
solution
.



Walking
in
the
Light

Here’s
my
reading
of
1
John
1
,
starting
with
verses
6
and
7
.




If
we
say
we
have
fellowship
with
God
while
we
walk
in
darkness
,
we

lie
and
do
not
practice
the
truth
.


But
if
we
walk
in
the
light
,
as
he

is
in
the
light
,
we
have
fellowship
with
one
another
,
and
the
blood
of

Jesus
his
Son
cleanses
us
from
all
sin
.



Now
,
that
is
staggeringly
amazing
.


“If
we
walk
in
the
light
.


.


.


the
blood
of
Jesus
.


.


.


cleanses
us
.

”
Wow
.


Here’s
1
John
1
:8
:
“If
we
say
we
have
no
sin
,
we
deceive
ourselves
,
and
the
truth
is
not
in
us
.

”
Now
he’s
reeling
it
back
in
and
saying
,
“Don’t
assume
that
when
I
say
,
‘Walk
in
the
light
,’
I
mean
sinlessness
.

”
First
John
1
:9–10
says
,
“If
we
confess
our
sins
,
he
is
faithful
and
just
to
forgive
us
our
sins
and
to
cleanse
us
from
all
unrighteousness
.


If
we
say
we
have
not
sinned
,
we
make
him
a
liar
,
and
his
word
is
not
in
us
.

”

Now
,
what’s
amazing
about
this
passage
is
that
it
says
we
must
be
walking
in
the
light
for
the
blood
of
Jesus
to
cleanse
us
from
our
sins
.


Then
he
says
that
this
walking
in
the
light
doesn’t
mean
sinlessness
.


We
are
liars
if
we
say
it
does
.


Then
he
explains
that
when
we
walk
in
the
light
,
we
see
clearly
enough
—
we
have
light
—
to
know
sin
,
to
see
sin
as
what
it
is
and
hate
it
and
confess
it
.


Then
we
enjoy
ongoing
cleansing
and
forgiveness
.




“A
good
conscience
is
virtually
the
same
as
walking
in
the
light
.

”

Here’s
what
I
would
draw
from
this
if
I
use
the
category
of
conscience
to
explain
this
passage
:
a
good
conscience
is
virtually
the
same
as
walking
in
the
light
.


Christians
should
be
able
to
say
,
“I’m
walking
in
the
light
,”
and
mean
it
,
and
mean
by
that
,
“I’m
walking
in
a
good
conscience
.

”
Which
means
I
don’t
think
we
should
equate
having
a
bad
conscience
with
having
indwelling
sin
.


Now
,
that
may
be
the
most
important
thing
I
say
,
Tony
.


Let
me
say
it
again
.


I’m
inferring
,
from
what
I’ve
said
from
1
John
1
,
that
having
a
bad
conscience
is
not
the
same
as
having
indwelling
sin
.


They’re
not
the
same
.



Our
Clear
Conscience

That’s
my
basic
answer
to
Arnaldo’s
question
.


He
feels
that
as
long
as
he
is
aware
of
the
reality
of
indwelling
sin
,
as
in
Romans
7
,
he
cannot
have
a
good
conscience
.


Now
,
if
that
were
true
,
I
don’t
think
Paul
could
ever
have
a
good
conscience
,
but
he
clearly
says
he
does
have
a
good
conscience
.



“I
thank
God
whom
I
serve
,
as
did
my
ancestors
,
with
a
clear
conscience”
(2
Timothy
1
:3)
.


He
expects
the
elders
of
the
church
to
do
the
same
:
“They
must
hold
the
mystery
of
the
faith
with
a
clear
conscience”
(1
Timothy
3
:9)
.


That’s
the
goal
for
all
Christians
.


According
to
1
Timothy
1
:5
,
“The
aim
of
our
charge
is
love
that
issues
from
a
pure
heart
and
a
good
conscience
and
a
sincere
faith
.

”
I
don’t
think
we
should
equate
a
good
conscience
with
sinless
perfection
in
this
life
,
nor
equate
a
bad
conscience
with
the
presence
of
indwelling
sin
or
remaining
corruption
.


Rather
,
a
clear
or
a
good
conscience
is
like
walking
in
the
light
.




If
we
walk
in
the
light
,
as
he
is
in
the
light
,
we
have
fellowship

with
one
another
,
and
the
blood
of
Jesus
his
Son
cleanses
us
from
all

sin
.


If
we
say
we
have
no
sin
[in
other
words
,
if
we
interpret

“walking
in
the
light”
as
“sinless
perfection”]
,
we
deceive
ourselves
,

and
the
truth
is
not
in
us
.


If
we
confess
our
sins
,
he
is
faithful
and

just
to
forgive
us
our
sins
and
to
cleanse
us
from
all

unrighteousness
.


(1
John
1
:7–9)

David’s
Example

I
think
both
Paul
and
John
inherited
this
concept
of
ongoing
,
indwelling
sin
that
nevertheless
coexists
with
a
good
conscience
from
the
Psalms
in
the
Old
Testament
.



For
example
,
in
Psalm
25
,
David
confesses
three
times
that
he’s
a
sinner
.


“[God]
instructs
sinners
in
the
way”
(verse
8)
;
“Pardon
my
guilt
,
for
it
is
great”
(verse
11)
;
“Forgive
all
my
sins”
(verse
18)
.


The
psalm
comes
to
an
end
in
verse
21
like
this
:
“May
integrity
and
uprightness
preserve
me
,
for
I
wait
for
you
.

”

In
David’s
mind
—
now
,
he’s
writing
under
God’s
inspiration
,
and
this
is
not
the
only
place
in
the
Psalms
;
there
are
a
lot
of
psalms
that
distinguish
the
righteous
and
the
wicked
.


The
righteous
are
really
righteous
:
they’re
walking
in
the
light
;
they
have
a
good
conscience
.


In
David’s
mind
,
there
is
an
integrity
and
an
uprightness
that
is
aware
of
indwelling
corruption
that
breaks
out
at
times
in
sins
.


It
does
.


And
that
ongoing
reality
of
indwelling
sin
does
not
nullify
what
David
calls
his
integrity
and
his
uprightness
.



I
think
Paul
and
John
saw
that
.


They
were
immersed
in
the
Old
Testament
and
used
language
that
way
.


John
used
the
language
of
walking
in
the
light
though
we
are
imperfect
.


Paul
used
the
language
of
walking
in
a
good
conscience
though
we
are
imperfect
.


I
think
for
all
of
them
(David
,
Paul
,
John)
,
the
key
that
enabled
them
to
think
this
way
is
that
they
all
knew
God
had
made
a
way
for
all
their
sins
to
be
passed
over
—
namely
,
the
blood
of
the
Lamb
,
Jesus
Christ
.


David
knew
this
was
coming
,
and
Paul
and
John
knew
it
had
come
.



I
do
think
Arnaldo
is
right
to
say
that
justification
by
faith
is
not
the
same
as
walking
in
a
good
conscience
,
or
walking
in
the
light
,
or
having
integrity
.


Those
are
real
character
traits
,
not
imputed
righteousness
.


Nevertheless
,
it’s
the
covering
of
all
their
sins
by
the
blood
of
Jesus
that
enables
them
to
look
upon
their
conscience
and
walking
and
integrity
with
thankfulness
and
confidence
that
it
really
will
be
accepted
by
God
as
good
,
though
imperfect
.



People
of
Integrity

Here’s
one
last
implication
.


People
might
think
,
“Well
,
how
does
this
matter
?

”
Here’s
a
concrete
illustration
of
how
it
matters
.


Suppose
a
pastor
is
accused
falsely
of
being
unfaithful
to
his
wife
.


The
reason
he’s
accused
is
because
someone
in
the
congregation
hates
him
and
wants
him
to
be
dismissed
.


When
he
comes
before
the
church
or
the
elders
to
state
the
truth
,
with
his
children
present
and
his
wife
looking
on
,
that
is
not
the
time
for
him
to
say
to
the
church
,
“Well
,
yes
,
I
am
a
sinner
like
everybody
else
.


I’m
no
better
than
adulterers
.


Everyone
has
indwelling
sin
that
crops
out
from
time
to
time
.


I
shouldn’t
be
put
on
a
pedestal
.


I’m
no
better
than
anyone
else
.

”

No
,
no
,
no
.


That
is
not
the
time
to
say
that
with
your
kids
listening
,
and
your
wife
listening
,
and
the
whole
church
wondering
.


What
you
need
to
say
at
that
moment
is
this
:
“My
conscience
is
clear
.


I
am
a
man
of
integrity
.


I
have
walked
in
the
light
.


I
have
never
touched
that
woman
or
any
woman
sexually
besides
my
wife
.


This
accusation
is
not
true
.

”

I
think
that
is
one
of
the
implications
of
what
Paul
is
saying
when
he
says
to
the
elders
and
to
the
rest
of
us
that
we
should
walk
in
a
good
conscience
—
or
as
John
would
say
,
walk
in
the
light
.

Abstract

Consciousness
can
be
defined
by
two
components
:
arousal
(wakefulness)
and
awareness
(subjective
experience)
.


However
,
neurophysiological
consciousness
metrics
able
to
disentangle
between
these
components
have
not
been
reported
.


Here
,
we
propose
an
explainable
consciousness
indicator
(ECI)
using
deep
learning
to
disentangle
the
components
of
consciousness
.


We
employ
electroencephalographic
(EEG)
responses
to
transcranial
magnetic
stimulation
under
various
conditions
,
including
sleep
(n
=
6)
,
general
anesthesia
(n
=
16)
,
and
severe
brain
injury
(n
=
34)
.


We
also
test
our
framework
using
resting-state
EEG
under
general
anesthesia
(n
=
15)
and
severe
brain
injury
(n
=
34)
.


ECI
simultaneously
quantifies
arousal
and
awareness
under
physiological
,
pharmacological
,
and
pathological
conditions
.


Particularly
,
ketamine-induced
anesthesia
and
rapid
eye
movement
sleep
with
low
arousal
and
high
awareness
are
clearly
distinguished
from
other
states
.


In
addition
,
parietal
regions
appear
most
relevant
for
quantifying
arousal
and
awareness
.


This
indicator
provides
insights
into
the
neural
correlates
of
altered
states
of
consciousness
.

Introduction

Responsiveness
is
often
thought
to
reflect
consciousness
,
and
for
a
long
time
,
unresponsiveness
was
considered
as
a
surrogate
of
unconsciousness
.


However
,
consciousness
and
responsiveness
are
two
different
concepts¹
.


Consciousness
is
considered
to
be
absent
during
sleep
or
anesthesia
,
but
in
certain
instances
,
subjective
experience
can
still
occur
(e
.

g
.


,
dreaming)^(2
,3)
.


Similarly
,
consciousness
has
been
described
as
a
result
of
both
arousal
and
awareness
components⁴
.


Arousal
refers
to
the
overall
state
of
alertness
(or
wakefulness)
.


In
contrast
,
awareness
refers
to
the
subjective
experience
,
such
as
perceiving
a
blue
triangle
versus
a
red
circle⁵
.


Typically
,
at
the
clinical
level
,
arousal
is
indicated
by
the
opening
of
the
eyes
,
and
awareness
is
inferred
by
the
ability
to
follow
commands
.



Various
levels
of
consciousness
exist
in
physiological
,
pharmacological
,
and
pathological
modifications
of
consciousness
(Table 1)
.


In
non-rapid
eye
movement
(NREM)
sleep
with
no
subsequent
reports
of
subjective
experiences
,
both
arousal
and
awareness
are
low
.


However
,
in
rapid
eye
movement
(REM)
sleep
with
dreams
,
arousal
is
low
but
awareness
can
reach
high
levels^(5
,6)
.


Under
general
anesthesia
,
propofol
and
xenon
predominantly
induce
states
similar
to
NREM
sleep
without
subjective
experiences
,
whereas
ketamine
induces
dream-like
experiences
similar
to
REM
sleep
with
subjective
reports
upon
awakening^(3
,7)
.


Additionally
,
recent
findings
suggest
that
a
minority
of
patients
under
anesthesia
may
also
be
conscious
of
their
environment
during
a
surgical
procedure
,
which
is
referred
to
as
connected
consciousness
.


These
patients
exhibit
the
ability
to
follow
commands
using
the
isolated
forearm
technique⁸
,
without
recollection
upon
awakening
.


Unresponsive
wakefulness
syndrome
(UWS)
describes
patients
who
recover
with
their
eyes
open
,
but
only
demonstrate
reflex
behaviors
,
while
patients
in
a
minimally
conscious
state
(MCS)
present
reproducible
non-reflex
movements⁹
.


In
both
UWS
and
MCS
patients
,
arousal
is
high
;
however
,
unlike
UWS
,
MCS
patients
also
show
signs
of
awareness
that
can
be
considered
as
a
sign
of
volitional
behavior^(10
,11)
.


However
,
certain
UWS
patients
(assessed
several
times
with
the
Coma
Recovery
Scale-Revised
(CRS-R)¹²
may
present
brain
activity
similar
to
MCS
patients
(e
.

g
.


,
high
brain
metabolism
measured
by
positron
emission
tomography)
.


This
peculiar
state
has
been
termed
non-behavioral
MCS
or
MCS*^(13
,14
,15)
.

An
effective
measure
of
consciousness
,
labeled
perturbational
complexity
index
(PCI)
,
was
developed
from
electroencephalographic
(EEG)
responses
to
direct
and
noninvasive
cortical
perturbation
with
transcranial
magnetic
stimulation
(TMS)¹⁶
.


PCI
quantifies
the
complexity
of
deterministic
patterns
of
significant
cortical
activation
evoked
by
TMS
.


This
index
was
validated
in
a
large
benchmark
population
to
derive
an
empirical
cutoff
(PCI*
=
0
.

31)
that
reliably
discriminates
between
unconsciousness
(PCI_(max)
≤
PCI*
:
NREM
sleep
;
midazolam-
,
propofol-
and
xenon-induced
anesthesia)
and
consciousness
(PCI_(max)
>
PCI*
:
REM
sleep
;
wakefulness
;
ketamine-induced
anesthesia
;
and
conscious
brain-injured
patients)¹⁷
.


However
,
PCI
cannot
discriminate
REM
sleep
or
ketamine-induced
anesthesia
from
healthy
wakefulness
.


In
addition
,
multiple
trials
are
required
to
compute
PCI^(16
,17)
.


A
few
studies
have
attempted
to
develop
an
objective
measure
of
consciousness
from
resting-state
EEG
brain
activity^(3
,4
,18
,19)
.


Interestingly
,
the
spectral
exponent
,
which
quantifies
the
slope
of
power
spectral
density
of
resting-state
EEG
activity
,
is
another
measure
of
consciousness
that
is
highly
correlated
with
PCI
and
allows
distinguishing
between
ketamine
and
propofol
or
xenon-induced
anesthesia³
.


In
addition
,
when
low-
(1–20
Hz)
and
high-band
(20–40
Hz)
spectral
exponents
are
jointly
considered
,
ketamine-induced
anesthesia
can
be
distinguished
from
wakefulness
,
and
the
xenon
and
propofol-induced
anesthesia
conditions
are
partially
superimposed
in
the
spectral
exponent
;
consequently
,
these
are
difficult
to
distinguish³
.


Recently
,
a
decrease
in
high-frequency
oscillations
and
an
increase
in
low-frequency
power
in
the
primary
sensory
,
motor
,
and
visual
cortices
were
observed
during
REM
sleep
when
compared
to
healthy
wakefulness²⁰
.


The
quantification
of
the
spectral
slope
between
30
and
50
Hz
was
also
proposed
for
discriminating
REM
sleep
from
healthy
wakefulness⁴
.


However
,
this
measure
did
not
differentiate
REM
from
NREM
sleep
;
thus
,
it
distinguishes
between
different
arousal
levels
but
not
awareness
levels
.


Therefore
,
an
alternative
measure
to
simultaneously
disentangle
the
two
components
of
consciousness
,
requiring
fewer
trials
,
would
be
a
valuable
and
necessary
tool
.



The
classical
neurophysiological
approach
for
calculating
PCI
,
power
spectral
density
,
and
spectral
exponent
relies
on
many
epochs
to
improve
the
reliability
of
statistical
estimates
of
these
indices²¹
.


However
,
these
methods
are
only
suitable
for
investigating
the
averaged
brain
states
and
they
can
only
clarify
general
neurophysiological
aspects
.


Machine
learning
(ML)
allows
decoding
and
identifying
specific
brain
states
and
discriminating
them
from
unrelated
brain
signals
,
even
in
a
single
trial
in
real-time²²
.


This
can
potentially
transform
statistical
results
at
the
group
level
into
individual
predictions⁹
.


A
deep
neural
network
,
which
is
a
popular
approach
in
ML
,
has
been
employed
to
classify
or
predict
brain
states
using
EEG
data²³
.


Particularly
,
a
convolutional
neural
network
(CNN)
is
the
most
extensively
used
technique
in
deep
learning
and
has
proven
to
be
effective
in
the
classification
of
EEG
data²⁴
.


However
,
a
CNN
has
the
drawback
that
it
cannot
provide
information
on
why
it
made
a
particular
prediction²⁵
.


Recently
,
layer-wise
relevance
propagation
(LRP)
has
successfully
demonstrated
why
classifiers
such
as
CNNs
have
made
a
specific
decision²⁶
.


Specifically
,
the
relevance
score
resulting
from
the
LRP
indicates
the
contribution
of
each
input
variable
to
the
classification
or
prediction
decision
.


Thus
,
a
high
score
in
a
particular
area
of
an
input
variable
implies
that
the
classifier
has
made
the
classification
or
prediction
using
this
feature
.


For
example
,
neurophysiological
data
suggest
that
the
left
motor
region
is
activated
during
right-hand
motor
imagery²⁷
.


The
LRP
indicates
that
the
neural
network
classifies
EEG
data
as
right-hand
motor
imagery
because
of
the
activity
of
the
left
motor
region²⁸
.


Therefore
,
the
relevance
score
was
higher
in
the
left
motor
region
than
in
other
regions
.


Thus
,
it
is
possible
to
interpret
the
neurophysiological
phenomena
underlying
the
decisions
of
CNNs
using
LRP
.



In
this
work
,
we
develop
a
metric
,
called
the
explainable
consciousness
indicator
(ECI)
,
to
simultaneously
quantify
the
two
components
of
consciousness—arousal
and
awareness—using
CNN
.


The
processed
time-series
EEG
data
were
used
as
an
input
of
the
CNN
.


Unlike
PCI
,
which
relies
on
source
modeling
and
permutation-based
statistical
analysis
,
ECI
used
event-related
potentials
at
the
sensor
level
for
spatiotemporal
dynamics
and
ML
approaches
.


For
a
generalized
model
,
we
used
the
leave-one-participant-out
(LOPO)
approach
for
transfer
learning
,
which
is
a
type
of
ML
that
transfers
information
to
a
new
participant
not
included
in
the
training
phase^(24
,27)
.


The
proposed
indicator
is
a
2D
value
consisting
of
indicators
of
arousal
(ECI^(aro))
and
awareness
(ECI^(awa))
.


First
,
we
used
TMS–EEG
data
collected
from
healthy
participants
during
NREM
sleep
with
no
subjective
experience
,
REM
sleep
with
subjective
experience
,
and
healthy
wakefulness
to
consider
each
component
of
consciousness
(i
.

e
.


,
low/high
arousal
and
low/high
awareness)
with
the
aim
to
analyze
correlations
between
the
proposed
ECI
and
the
three
states
,
namely
NREM
,
REM
,
and
wakefulness
.


Next
,
we
measured
ECI
using
TMS–EEG
data
collected
under
general
anesthesia
with
ketamine
,
propofol
,
and
xenon
,
again
with
the
aim
to
measure
correlation
with
these
three
anesthetics
.


Before
anesthesia
,
TMS–EEG
data
were
also
recorded
during
healthy
wakefulness
.


Upon
awakening
,
healthy
participants
reported
conscious
experience
during
ketamine-induced
anesthesia
and
no
conscious
experience
during
propofol-
and
xenon-induced
anesthesia
.


Finally
,
TMS–EEG
data
were
collected
from
patients
with
disorders
of
consciousness
(DoC)
,
which
includes
patients
diagnosed
as
UWS
and
MCS
patients
.


We
hypothesized
that
our
proposed
ECI
can
clearly
distinguish
between
the
two
components
of
consciousness
under
physiological
,
pharmacological
,
and
pathological
conditions
.



To
verify
the
proposed
indicator
,
we
next
compared
ECI^(awa)
with
PCI
,
which
is
a
reliable
index
for
consciousness
.


Then
,
we
applied
ECI
to
additional
resting-state
EEG
data
acquired
in
the
anesthetized
participants
and
patients
with
DoC
.


We
hypothesize
that
if
CNN
can
learn
characteristics
related
to
consciousness
,
it
could
calculate
ECI
accurately
even
without
TMS
in
the
proposed
framework
.


In
terms
of
clinical
applicability
,
it
is
important
to
use
the
classifier
from
the
previous
LOPO
training
of
the
old
data
to
classify
the
new
data
(without
additional
training)
.


Therefore
,
we
computed
ECI
in
patients
with
DoC
using
a
hold-out
approach²⁹
,
where
training
data
and
evaluation
data
are
arbitrarily
divided
,
instead
of
cross-validation
.


Finally
,
we
investigated
why
the
classifier
generated
these
decisions
using
LRP
to
interpret
ECI³⁰
.


We
show
that
proposed
ECI
using
interpretable
deep
learning
distinguishes
arousal
and
awareness
between
normal
consciousness
,
sleep
,
anesthesia
,
and
patients
with
DoC
.


Furthermore
,
we
show
that
the
parietal
region
is
most
closely
related
to
quantifying
arousal
and
awareness
in
altered
states
of
consciousness
.



Results

Overview
of
the
calculation
of
ECI

We
used
TMS–EEG
data
in
three
conditions
:
(i)
sleep
,
(ii)
general
anesthesia
,
and
(iii)
severely
brain-injured
patients
(Fig
.

 1a)
.


Figure 1b
shows
the
framework
for
calculating
ECI
to
distinguish
between
low
and
high
states
in
each
arousal
and
awareness
.


To
explore
the
optimal
input
and
classifier
,
we
compared
the
single-trial
classification
performance
in
each
component
(see
Supplementary
Notes 1–2
,
Supplementary
Figs
.

 1–3
,
and
Supplementary
Tables 1–3)
.


For
an
input
in
the
classifier
,
we
converted
time-series
EEG
data
to
3D
data
(2D
meshes
according
to
the
spatial
information
+
1D
vector
according
to
temporal
information)
.


The
CNN
model
was
used
to
distinguish
low
from
high
state
in
each
arousal
and
awareness
.


Next
,
the
interclass
probability
in
the
new
target
participant
was
calculated
using
the
trained
model
.


Finally
,
ECI
was
measured
by
averaging
the
probability
of
a
high
state
in
each
arousal
and
awareness
over
a
single
session
.

Data
description

The
same
participants
participated
in
transcranial
magnetic
stimulation-induced
electroencephalography
(TMS–EEG)
and
resting-state
electroencephalography
(EEG)
measurements
.


The
sleep
condition
did
not
include
resting-state
EEG
,
and
one
participant
under
ketamine-mediated
anesthesia
was
missing
in
resting-state
EEG
.


b
Schematic
framework
for
determining
the
explainable
consciousness
indicator
(ECI)
.


In
step
1
,
raw
EEG
signals
were
converted
into
a
spatio-spectral
or
spatiotemporal
3D
matrix
.


In
step
2
,
the
converted
3D
feature
was
used
on
a
convolutional
neural
network
in
the
two
components
of
consciousness
:
arousal
and
awareness
.


In
each
arousal
and
awareness
state
,
the
EEG
data
were
trained
as
two
classes
(low
versus
high)
.


For
example
,
for
awareness
,
rapid
eye
movement
(REM)
sleep
with
subjective
experience
(i
.

e
.


,
dreaming)
and
healthy
wakefulness
belong
to
the
same
class
in
terms
of
high
awareness
;
however
,
for
arousal
,
non-rapid
eye
movement
(NREM)
with
no
subjective
experience
and
REM
sleep
with
subjective
experience
belong
to
the
same
class
in
terms
of
low
arousal
.


The
output
\({p}_{i}\)
indicates
the
probability
in
the
trial
i
of
arousal
and
awareness
.


For
the
training
and
test
phase
,
we
used
the
leave-one
participant-out
approach
as
transfer
learning
.


Therefore
,
the
EEG
data
in
the
source
pool
were
used
for
training
and
the
data
of
target
participants
was
predicted
for
arousal
or
awareness
.


The
source
pool
contains
data
corresponding
to
the
source
domain
except
for
the
target
participant
.


In
step
3
,
the
interclass
probability
for
each
arousal
and
awareness
was
averaged
for
calculating
ECI
in
each
session
j
.


The
averaged
probability
\({C}_{j}\)
is
ECI^(aro)
and
ECI^(awa)
on
the
x-
and
y-axes
,
respectively
.


Therefore
,
we
represented
the
2D
consciousness
indicator
for
the
two
components
of
consciousness
.


In
the
final
step
,
we
checked
which
brain
signals
the
model
has
learned
and
why
it
made
such
a
decision
using
layer-wise
relevance
propagation
(LRP)
.


Through
this
step
,
we
could
interpret
the
proposed
indicator
.


ECI^(awa)
=
ECI
in
awareness
component
;
ECI^(aro)
=
ECI
in
arousal
component
.

:
Overview
of
the
study
.



To
improve
the
classification
performance
,
we
trained
the
models
with
domain
transfer
learning
,
which
uses
the
knowledge
learned
in
one
domain
to
improve
generalization
,
based
on
similarity
in
the
sense
of
pooling
the
training
data
across
domains
(Supplementary
Fig
.

 4)
.


When
referring
to
domain
transfer
learning
using
the
EEG
signals
in
this
study
,
the
domain
refers
to
the
clinical
condition
in
which
the
EEG
signals
were
acquired
.


Precisely
,
three
domains
were
considered
here
:
sleep
,
anesthesia
,
and
patients
with
DoC
.


In
domain
transfer
learning
,
the
target
domain
indicates
a
state
that
contains
a
single
session
for
calculating
ECI
,
whereas
the
source
domain
indicates
those
sessions
that
are
included
in
the
training
phase
.


Therefore
,
the
information
(knowledge)
trained
in
the
source
domain
is
applied
when
testing
the
target
domain
,
and
this
is
described
as
the
transfer
of
learned
information
for
domain
transfer
learning
.


In
the
LOPO
approach
,
the
data
from
all
the
participants
in
the
source
domain
,
except
for
the
target
participant
,
were
used
for
training
(Supplementary
Fig
.

 3b)
.


Note
that
the
data
for
training
and
testing
did
not
overlap
.


We
used
all
three
domains
to
classify
high
and
low
states
in
both
arousal
and
awareness
(Table 2)
.


Consequently
,
the
classification
performance
was
higher
when
training
with
a
closer
domain
(see Supplementary
Notes 3–4
and
Supplementary
Table 4)
.


Therefore
,
we
trained
these
domains
together
when
calculating
ECI
in
sleep
and
anesthesia
domains
,
but
trained
the
DoC
domain
along
with
the
anesthesia
domain
when
calculating
ECI
in
patients
with
DoC
.

Then
,
we

in
two
conditions
:
(i)
general
anesthesia
and
(ii)
severely

we
classified
low

high
states
in
resting-state
EEG
data
for
arousal
and
awareness
using
domain
transfer
learning
(Table 3)

This
result

data
,
considering
that
there
was
no
resting-state
EEG
during
sleep
in
the
same
participants
(see
Supplementary

Based
on
the
results
of

transfer
learning
,
we
used
only
the
anesthesia
domain
for
calculating
ECI
under
anesthesia
;

the
DoC
and

domains
were
used
for

in

with

for

ECI
in

ECI

:
Characteristics
of
ECI
in
TMS–EEG
.



We
measured
ECI
using
three
anesthetic
drugs
(ketamine
,
propofol
,
and
xenon)
and
wakefulness
before
anesthesia
(Fig
.

 2b)
.


ECI
in
ketamine-induced
anesthesia
demonstrated
low
arousal
and
high
awareness
,
whereas
propofol-
and
xenon-induced
anesthesia
showed
low
arousal
and
awareness
.


Also
,
all
periods
of
wakefulness
showed
high
arousal
and
awareness
.


As
a
result
of
the
ROC
analysis
,
classification
using
ECI
achieved
an
AUC
,
sensitivity
,
and
specificity
of
1
.

0
for
all
parameters
for
both
arousal
and
awareness
(Fig
.

 2d)
.



In
patients
with
DoC
,
ECI
indicated
high
arousal
and
awareness
in
MCS
patients
and
high
arousal
and
low
awareness
in
UWS
patients
(Fig
.

 2c)
.


AUC
,
sensitivity
,
and
specificity
of
ECI
were
1
.

0
for
both
high
and
low
states
of
awareness
(Fig
.

 2d)
.


ROC
analysis
for
arousal
was
not
conducted
because
both
UWS
and
MCS
patients
were
considered
to
have
high
arousal
.


We
additionally
applied
ECI
to
four
MCS*
patients
;
these
cases
were
not
included
in
the
training
phase
.


Similar
to
patients
with
DoC
,
anesthesia
and
DoC
domains
were
selected
as
source
domains
in
the
training
phase
.


For
the
MCS*
patients
,
ECI
successfully
predicted
high
arousal
and
awareness
,
as
expected
(Supplementary
Fig
.

 5)
.



Relationship
with
PCI

We
calculated
PCI
in
TMS–EEG
sessions
that
had
at
least
80
trials
with
healthy
participants
under
sleep
,
anesthesia
,
and
brain-injury
conditions
.


PCI
in
all
three
conditions
was
consistent
with
the
optimal
cutoff
(0
.

31^(16
,17))
that
maximizes
the
accuracy
of
the
distinction
between
consciousness
and
unconsciousness
in
a
benchmark
population
.


For
ECI
,
the
optimal
cutoff
of
0
.

5
perfectly
distinguished
low
or
high
states
of
arousal
and
awareness
in
the
physiological
,
pharmacological
,
and
pathological
conditions
(see
Supplementary
Note 5)
.



We
investigated
the
relationship
between
ECI^(awa)
and
PCI
(Fig
.

 3)
.


During
sleep
,
a
positive
correlation
between
ECI^(awa)
and
PCI
was
observed
(r
=
0
.

872
,
p
<
0
.

001)
.


Similarly
,
ECI^(awa)
during
anesthesia
and
in
brain-injured
patients
showed
a
strong
correlation
with
PCI
(anesthesia
:
r
=
0
.

885
,
p

001
;
brain
injury
:
r
=
0
.

770
,
p
<

.

.


ECI^(awa)
and
PCI
,
therefore
,
matched
for
all
states
.

The
practicality
of
calculating
ECI

We
explored
the
possibility
of
calculating
ECI
with
a
limited
number
of
trials
during
sleep
and
wakefulness
.


The
classification
performance
was
compared
through
the
calculation
of
ECI
from
a
single
trial
up
to
the
standard
number
of
trials
(i
.

e
.


,
80
trials
similar
to
PCI¹⁶)
(Fig
.

 5)
.


In
the
sleep
and
healthy
wakefulness
conditions
,
the
performance
reached
a
specificity
of
0
.

853
,
a
sensitivity
of
0
.

884
,
and
an
AUC
of
0
.

931
when
using
single
trials
(based
on
one
TMS
pulse)
,
but
from
2
trials
,
it
was
above
0

for
specificity
,
sensitivity
,
and
AUC
.


In
the

conditions
,
the

performance
from

trials
is

the
number
of
trials
in
the
ECI
calculation
.



Figure 6
shows
the
possibility
of
awareness
being
high
for
the
first
participant
in
each
of
these
conditions
:
sleep
,
anesthesia
(ketamine
,
propofol
,
and
xenon)
,
and
patients
with
DoC
(UWS
and
MCS)
.


For
instance
,
as
NREM
sleep
is
considered
to
have
low
awareness
,
in
P01
,
it
was
correctly
predicted
when
the
probability
in
a
single
trial
was
less
than
0
.

5
.


Notably
,
NREM
sleep
showed
that
17
trials
were
incorrectly
predicted
with
a
probability
higher
than
0
.

5
.


In
addition
,
1
out
of
80
trials
in
both
REM
sleep
and
healthy
wakefulness
showed
a
value
less
than
0
.

5
and
were
incorrectly
predicted
.


This
indicates
that
ECI
can
be
predicted
as
somewhat
low
or
high
,
even
in
a
single
trial
.


There
was
a
clear
spatiotemporal
difference
between
correct
and
incorrect
trials
only
in
parietal
regions
(Supplementary
Fig
.

 6)
.


No
significant
differences
between
both
types
of
trials
were
observed
over
frontal
and
temporal
regions
.


However
,
in
parietal
regions
,
TMS-evoked
potentials
at
350–400
ms
were
significantly
higher
in
incorrect
trials
than
in
correct
trials
.


In
a
single
trial
,
these
different
patterns
resulted
in
misprediction
.


Nevertheless
,
the
effect
of
the
incorrect
trials
(i
.

e
.


,
a
failure
to
predict)
was
eliminated
because
ECI
was
calculated
by
averaging
the
interclass
probability
in
a
single
trial
.


The
probability
in
a
single
trial
is
shown
in
Supplementary

for
other
participants
in

We

Each

the

If
it

in

,
during

,
NREM

To
demonstrate
that
the
method
can
be
easily
applied
to
a
new
set
of
patients
(without
additional
training)
to
identify
their
state
of
consciousness
in
a

,
we
computed
ECI
using
the
hold-out

,

In
both

,
the
ECI
using
the

method
indicated
high
arousal
and
awareness
in
MCS

,
whereas
high

and
low

in

.


This
was

These
results
show
that
the
proposed
method
generalizes
to
new
data
without

the
classifier
.



Interpretation
for
calculating
ECI

We
further
checked
what
the
classifier
learned
through
CNN
and
how
it
was
able
to
derive
those
results
using
LRP
.


This
algorithm
describes
the
predictions
of
CNN
in
a
given
dataset
using
relevance
scores³⁰
.


Figure 7
shows
the
relevance
scores
for
arousal
and
awareness
among
the
frontal
,
temporal
,
and
parietal
regions
at
the
scalp
level
for
calculating
ECI
using
TMS–EEG
.


A
high
relevance
score
implies
that
the
trained
model
recognized
the
brain
region
that
determines
whether
it
is
low
or
high
arousal
and
awareness
.


Specifically
,
brain
regions
with
higher
relevance
scores
indicate
that
brain
signals
over
that
region
contributed
more
to
the
decision
of
the
classifier
on
whether
arousal
and
awareness
were
low
or
high
.


In
the
three
conditions
(sleep
,
anesthesia
,
and
patients
with
DoC)
,
the
relevance
score
over
the
parietal
region
was
higher
than
those
in
the
frontal
and
temporal
regions
at
the
group
level
for
both
arousal
and
awareness
.


The
detailed
statistical
results
are
reported
in
Supplementary
Table 5
.


However
,
since
most
TMS
sites
targeted
the
parietal
cortex
,
it
can
be
argued
that
the
relevance
of
parietal
regions
to
correctly
classify
datasets
may
be
biased
.


Therefore
,
we
investigated
the
relevance
scores
with
only
non-parietal
stimulations
in
patients
with
DoC
.


As
a
result
,
the
parietal
region
had
statistically
higher
relevance
scores
than
the
frontal
and
temporal
regions
in
both
arousal
and
awareness
(Supplementary
Fig
.

 11
and
Table 6)
.


Similarly
,
there
was
a
higher
relevance
score
over
the
parietal
region
in
both
arousal
and
awareness
when
calculating
ECI
from
resting-state
EEG
(Supplementary

.

Discussion

We
show
that
ECI
clearly
distinguishes
between
low
and
high
states
of
arousal
and
awareness
in
TMS–EEG
results
under
sleep
,
anesthesia
,
and
patients
with
DoC
.


Our
results
suggest
that
this
proposed
indicator
could
similarly
be
used
for
resting-state
EEG
data
without
TMS
under
anesthesia
and
patients
with
DoC
,
yielding
the
same
degree
of
accuracy
.


In
addition
,
a
high
correlation
with
PCI
,
which
measures
the
integrated
EEG
response
of
the
thalamocortical
system
to
a
direct
perturbation
induced
by
TMS¹⁶
,
proves
that
ECI^(awa)
is
reliable
using
TMS–EEG
data
.


It
also
shows
that
the
two
measures
calculated
entirely
independently
using
different
methods
resulted
in
the
same
conclusion
,
which
is
a
sign
that
deep
learning
is
indeed
a
valid
and
reliable
approach
.


For
an
ML-based
indicator
,
ECI
can
be
calculated
using
very
few
trials
.


Furthermore
,
because
the
classifier
learned
specific
features
of
the
data
on
its
own
,
our
indicator
can
be
computed
regardless
of
whether
TMS
is
applied
or
its
location
.


Therefore
,
ECI
is
a
significantly
practical
and
reliable
indicator
to
evaluate
levels
of
consciousness
under
various
conditions
.


Our
analyses
using
LRP
highlighted
the
major
role
of
the
parietal
region
in
determining
consciousness
,
as
the
classifier
primarily
uses
brain
activity
in
this
lobe
for
predicting
low
and
high
states
of
arousal
and
awareness
.



TMS–EEG
responses
under
sleep
exhibited
well-known
phenomena³¹
.


In
wakefulness
,
TMS
generates
a
series
of
low-amplitude
high-frequency
activities
related
to
cortical
flow
in
long-range
connections³²
.


A
similar
long-lasting
response
is
evoked
during
REM
sleep
with
subjective
experience³³
.


During
NREM
sleep
with
no
subjective
experience
,
TMS
triggers
larger
,
low-frequency
activity
that
quickly
dissipates³²
,
which
is
the
hallmark
of
bistability
in
the
thalamocortical
system
.


Cortical
effective
connectivity
is
also
broken
down
during
NREM
sleep^(33
,34)
.


The
brain
response
to
TMS
perturbation
was
already
used
to
distinguish
the
levels
of
awareness
,
irrespective
of
sensory
processing
and
motor
responses
under
physiological
,
pharmacological
,
and
pathological
conditions^(34
,35
,36)
.


Therefore
,
this
TMS-evoked
response
was
applied
to
our
end-to-end
CNN
framework
.


Similar
to
several
studies
using
ML
,
we
observed
higher
two-class
(low
or
high)
classification
accuracy
using
CNN
when
compared
to
linear
discriminant
analysis
(LDA)
and
support
vector
machine
(SVM)
for
both
arousal
and
awareness
.


This
suggests
that
our
framework
is
especially
relevant
for
EEG
results
,
which
possess
several
nonlinear
features
.


The
classification
performance
of
spatiotemporal
information
was
higher
than
that
of
spatio-spectral
information
.


Using
our
framework
,
it
was
shown
that
temporal
information
discriminates
different
levels
of
consciousness
more
clearly
than
spectral
information
,
as
the
functional
connectivity
associated
with
consciousness
changes
in
both
space
and
time³⁷
.


However
,
this
does
not
imply
that
temporal
information
is
more
important
than
spectral
information
for
distinguishing
consciousness
.


Temporal
information
has
more
distinct
characteristics
than
spectral
information
for
predicting
the
state
of
consciousness
in
the
proposed
framework
.


Nevertheless
,
PCI
also
used
spatiotemporal
dynamics
in
TMS-evoked
responses¹⁶
,
which
is
significantly
important
for
distinguishing
consciousness
.



We
applied
transfer
learning
to
a
single
domain
as
well
as
multiple
domains
.


In
the
sleep
domain
,
classification
performance
was
high
when
trained
on
only
the
sleep
domain
or
together
with
the
anesthesia
domain
.


Due
to
a
large
number
of
trials
in
the
sleep
domain
,
training
was
performed
satisfactorily
using
only
sleep
data
.


The
distance
of
the
averaged
TMS-evoked
potentials
under
the
domains
of
anesthesia
and
sleep
was
significantly
close
,
which
indicated
that
the
two
domains
were
highly
similar³⁸
.


Thus
,
a
close
distance
implies
that
the
two
domains
have
similar
patterns
,
and
the
classification
performance
indeed
increased
when
these
domains
were
trained
together
.


In
the
anesthesia
and
DoC
domains
,
the
trials
of
a
single
domain
were
not
sufficient
;
thus
a
higher
classification
performance
was
achieved
when
trained
with
similar
domains
.


In
addition
,
brain
signals
change
over
time
,
even
when
recorded
with
the
same
participants
because
of
physiological
and
psychological
differences
over
time²⁷
.


Therefore
,
participant-independent
learning
such
as
the
LOPO
cross-validation
is
considerably
difficult
,
as
opposed
to
participant-dependent
learning²⁴
.


We
solved
these
problems
via
transfer
learning
utilizing
multiple
domains
and
participant-independent
ECI
.



ECI
,
by
averaging
interclass
probability
,
distinguished
whether
each
state
was
low
or
high
in
both
arousal
and
awareness
.


Because
of
its
inherently
high
two-class
performance
,
it
was
possible
to
calculate
the
discriminable
ECI
using
a
few
trials
in
a
single
session
.


The
criteria
used
for
determining
ECI^(aro)
and
ECI^(awa)
were
different
,
especially
for
REM
sleep
,
ketamine-induced
anesthesia
,
and
UWS
patients
.


Although
the
dataset
was
the
same
,
these
states
were
trained
by
different
labels
depending
on
arousal
and
awareness
.


For
instance
,
REM
sleep
is
high
in
awareness
but
low
in
arousal
.


The
proposed
classifier
learns
models
for
these
different
criteria
by
training
itself
based
on
the
criteria
of
arousal
and
awareness
.


Specifically
,
because
the
learning
ability
of
the
CNN
is
derived
from
the
automatic
extraction
of
complicated
representations
from
EEG
signals³⁹
,
it
can
properly
distinguish
between
both
states
,
even
if
the
same
state
has
different
labels
depending
on
the
criteria
.


We
further
used
data
from
MCS*
patients
as
verification
samples
.


MCS*
patients
were
correctly
predicted
,
since
data
from
UWS
and
MCS
patients
were
included
during
training
,
and
the
classifier
is
independent
of
behavior
.



According
to
the
LRP
,
we
observed
higher
relevance
scores
in
the
parietal
regions
,
compared
to
other
regions
at
the
scalp
level
.


This
was
observed
for
all
data
,
including
TMS–EEG
and
resting-state
EEG
results
.


The
brain
regions
that
led
to
decision-making
were
similar
in
arousal
and
awareness
.


However
,
this
does
not
imply
that
arousal
and
awareness
are
supported
by
the
same
underlying
neurophysiological
mechanisms
.


The
relevance
scores
simply
explain
the
patterns
of
cortical
EEG
activity
resulting
in
this
classification
.



In
sleep
and
healthy
wakefulness
,
when
arousal
and
awareness
were
high
,
they
were
highly
relevant
in
the
parietal
region
.


This
EEG
feature
,
which
distinguishes
high
and
low
states
in
arousal
and
awareness
,
can
be
interpreted
in
line
with
the
posterior
hot
zone
of
consciousness⁴⁰
.


Local
changes
in
this
parietal
region
are
associated
with
the
occurrence
of
dreaming
and
unconscious
sleep^(41
,42)
,
and
our
framework
may
learn
from
EEG
pivotal
features
recorded
in
this
area
.


The
importance
of
the
posterior
hot
zone
has
already
been
emphasized
using
the
within-state
sleep
paradigm^(43
,44)
.


Similar
to
sleep
,
we
observed
high
relevance
scores
for
the
parietal
region
in
the
domains
of
both
anesthesia
and
patients
with
DoC
.


This
implies
that
EEG
activity
in
this
region
had
a
decisive
effect
in
determining
the
high
and
low
states
of
arousal
and
awareness
.


The
increased
slow-wave
activity
was
observed
under
propofol-
and
xenon-induced
anesthesia
when
compared
to
healthy
wakefulness
before
drug
administration³⁶
.


In
addition
,
just
as
cortical
neurons
induced
bistable
changes
during
NREM
sleep
,
TMS
in
propofol-mediated
anesthesia-induced
low-amplitude
,
low-frequency
,
positive–negative
potentials
,
and
TMS
in
xenon-mediated
anesthesia
caused
a
significantly
large
amplitude
but
stereotyped
positive–negative
deflection³⁶
.


Moreover
,
under
ketamine-induced
anesthesia
,
TMS-evoked
response
was
determined
to
be
similar
to
REM
sleep
,
which
features
dreaming
during
a
low
state
of
arousal³⁶
.


Previous
studies
have
shown
that
the
change
in
slow
waves
induced
by
propofol
is
primarily
observed
in
the
posterior
hot
zone⁴⁵
and
the
posterior
main
hub
is
disrupted
during
anesthesia-induced
alteration
of
consciousness⁷
.


In
UWS
patients
,
TMS
triggered
a
local
and
slow
response
similar
to
NREM
sleep
and
general
anesthesia
,
whereas
MCS
patients
showed
complex
TMS-evoked
responses³³
.


Similarly
,
differences
in
alpha
connectivity
between
the
UWS
and
MCS
patients
are
apparent
within
the
posterior
hot
zone⁴⁶
.


That
is
,
when
determining
whether
arousal
and
awareness
are
low
or
high
,
our
classifiers
used
differences
and
changes
in
EEG
activity
over
the
parietal
region
to
make
decisions
.


Particularly
,
similar
results
were
observed
in
patients
with
DoC
using
several
TMS
target
sites
,
and
in
sleep
and
anesthesia
domains
,
where
the
parietal
region
was
primarily
stimulated
.


This
suggests
that
our
findings
regarding
the
parietal
region
are
unrelated
to
the
TMS
target
site
.


Thus
,
our
trained
model
used
neurophysiological
features
to
classify
whether
arousal
and
awareness
are
low
or
high
.


This
indicates
an
appropriate
design
of
our
model
as
the
classification
decision
was
primarily
based
on
EEG
signals
over
the
parietal
region
,
which
is
suggested
to
be
a
hot
spot
of
consciousness
,
compared
to
the
frontal
region⁴³
.


The
difference
in
the
parietal
region
could
be
clearly
identified
through
correct
trials
during
sleep
and
healthy
wakefulness
.


It
is
meaningful
that
the
frontal
region
contributed
less
than
parietal
regions
in
the
context
of
the
controversy
regarding
the
spatial
localization
of
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness^(40
,45)
.


Considering
the
subcortical
influences
related
to
striatal-thalamic
circuits
,
it
has
been
recently
observed
that
the
parietal
region
contributes
more
to
the
levels
of
consciousness
than
the
frontal
region⁴⁷
.


The
implication
of
the
parietal
cortex
in
consciousness
has
also
been
demonstrated
in
other
neuroimaging
modalities
,
such
as
functional
magnetic
resonance
imaging⁴⁸
and
magnetoencephalography⁴⁹
.



This
study
does
have
certain
limitations
.


First
,
our
sample
size
was
relatively
small
.


In
the
future
,
it
will
be
necessary
to
further
test
the
reliability
of
the
proposed
indicator
with
larger
cohorts
and
validate
it
at
the
clinical
level
before
implementing
it
in
a
clinical
setting
.


Sleep
experiments
would
also
have
to
be
applied
to
more
participants
in
the
future
.


Second
,
we
explored
the
possibility
of
calculating
ECI
with
a
minimal
amount
of
data
,
up
to
a
single
trial
.


However
,
we
did
not
attempt
to
measure
ECI
in
real
time
.


Thus
,
in
the
future
,
ECI
could
be
calculated
in
real-time
for
practical
application
.


Third
,
ECI
does
not
differentiate
between
physiological
,
pharmacological
,
and
pathological
conditions
,
but
distinguishes
between
high
and
low
states
of
arousal
and
awareness
.


ECI
can
thus
distinguish
between
REM
sleep
(or
ketamine)
and
wakefulness
.


It
may
also
be
difficult
to
select
the
model
to
use
when
calculating
ECI
since
the
domain
has
to
be
known
beforehand
.


Nevertheless
,
if
a
single
domain
has
sufficient
trials
,
the
LOPO
approach
would
be
the
most
accurate
.


Another
limitation
might
be
related
to
the
possible
contamination
of
TMS-EEG
data
by
auditory
and
somatosensory
components
.


As
in
previous
studies^(17
,35
,36)
,
to
avoid
auditory
and
somatosensory
co-stimulation
,
participants
wore
earphones
with
noise
masking
and
a
thin
foam
between
the
scalp
and
the
TMS
coil
that
was
used
.


Although
it
is
difficult
to
systematically
rule
out
the
contribution
of
sensory
co-stimulation
in
every
measurement
,
the
application
of
effective
noise-masking
procedures⁵⁰
and
the
real-time
monitoring
of
data
quality
during
the
acquisition⁵¹
may
significantly
mitigate
this
issue⁵²
.


Finally
,
ECI
indicates
whether
arousal
and
awareness
are
low
or
high
and
cannot
be
considered
functional
.


It
,
therefore
,
should
be
developed
into
a
functional
index
.



In
conclusion
,
we
proposed
ECI
as
a
neurophysiological
indicator
to
simultaneously
discriminate
the
levels
of
arousal
and
awareness
in
modified
states
of
consciousness
.


This
tool
allows
disentangling
the
levels
of
consciousness
,
with
a
single
measure
,
in
different
clinical
settings
such
as
monitoring
surgical
interventions
(i
.

e
.


,
anesthesia-induced
states)
and
diagnosing
patients
with
DoC
.


This
indicator
was
validated
under
different
physiological
,
pharmacological
,
and
pathological
conditions
,
and
it
reliably
disentangled
low
levels
from
high
levels
of
both
arousal
and
awareness
.


Besides
,
the
proposed
ECI
is
considerably
accessible
and
practical
,
as
it
can
be
applied
to
resting-state
EEG
without
TMS
,
and
requires
fewer
trials
.


Therefore
,
the
proposed
indicator
can
be
a
reliable
discriminator
and
valuable
tool
as
an
objective
measure
of
consciousness
.


As
parietal
regions
appear
to
be
the
most
relevant
for
classification
,
an
EEG
configuration
around
that
area
could
be
sufficient
if
ECI
is
used
in
clinical
practice
.


These
findings
could
be
useful
in
diagnosing
severely
brain-injured
patients
and
monitoring
their
levels
of
consciousness
in
real-time
,
especially
in
clinical
settings
where
time
constraints
preclude
long-duration
assessment
.


The
proposed
reliable
ECI
can
provide
insights
into
the
classification
of
conscious
levels
using
deep
learning
and
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
.

After
3
min
or
more
,
when
the
participant
entered
a
specific
sleep
stage
,
TMS
was
applied
over
the
parietal
cortex
using
a
navigated
brain
stimulation
system
(eXimia

were
included
under
ketamine-
(n

,
propofol-
(n

,
and
xenon-induced
(n

anesthesia
.


The
inclusion
criteria
included
(i)
older

,
and
(iii)
medical

;
moreover
,
all
participants
provided
written

TMS
was
applied
over
the
left
parietal
or
motor
regions
after
participants
reached
deep
unresponsiveness
(a
score
equal
to
5
in
the
Ramsay
scale
,
which
corresponds
to
no

In
addition
,
upon
waking
up
from
anesthesia
,
reports
about
the

were
collected
.


Conclusively
,
the
participants
reported
little
conscious
experience
during
propofol-

All
of

moreover
,
newly

data
used
exactly
the

These

data
were
recently
acquired
by
Dr
.


Olivia
Gosseries

Steven
Laureys
team
at
the
University
of

.


For
the
added
data
,
the
inclusion
and
exclusion
criteria
for
patients
were
exactly
the
same
as
the
previously
used
data
.


These
data
are
part
of
a
bigger
study
conducted
in
the
frame
of
the
Human
Brain
Project
.


The
final
dataset
consisted
of
15
UWS
patients
,
15
MCS
patients
,
and
4
MCS*
patients
.


The
detailed
demographic
and
clinical
information
of
severely
brain-injured
patients
is
listed
in
Supplementary
Table 10
.


The
TMS
target
site
was
selected
using
a
neuronavigation
system
over
the
parietal
,
motor
,
or
premotor
regions
,
avoiding
structural
lesions
using
the
magnetic
resonance
imaging
data
of
the
patient
.


The
stimuli
target
sites
for
all
participants
are
listed
in
Supplementary
Table 11
.


The
participants
remained
awake
or
were
kept
awake
using
the
CRS-R
arousal
protocol
in
between
TMS
stimulation¹²
.



For
the
four
datasets
,
EEG
data
were
recorded
using
a
60-channel
TMS-compatible
amplifier
and
a
two-channel
electrooculogram
(Nexstim
eXimia
,
Nexstim
Plc
,
Finland)
with
a
1450
Hz
sampling
rate
.


During
all
the
sessions
,
earphones
presenting
white
noise
were
used
to
reduce
the
noise
of
the
TMS
pulses
and
we
used
a
thin
foam
between
the
scalp
and
the
TMS
coil
to
avoid
somatosensory
evoked
potentials
.


These
pulses
were
presented
at
random
intervals
of
2–2
.

3
s
using
a
figure-of-eight
coil
.


The
maximum
electric
field
was
between
100
and
130
V/m
at
the
TMS
target
site
.


In
particular
,
the
TMS
stimulation
was
always
performed
in
the
medial
half
of
one
hemisphere
,
to
avoid
any
muscle
artifacts
.



Finally
,
we
used
resting-state
EEG
without
TMS
for
the
domains
of
anesthesia
and
severely
brain-injured
patients
.


These
data
were
acquired
using
the
same
participants
as
in
the
TMS–EEG
experiments
.


We
used
the
ketamine-
(n
=
5)
,
propofol-
(n
=
5)
,
and
xenon-induced
anesthesia
data
(n
=
5)
as
previously
reported
by
Sarasso
et
al
.

³⁶
.


For
at
least
3
min
before
the
TMS–EEG
experiments
,
resting-state
EEG
data
were
recorded
during
anesthesia
and
each
state
of
wakefulness
before
the
anesthesia
.


With
regard
to
the
severely
brain-injured
patients
,
5-min
resting-state
EEG
for
MCS
patients
(n
=
15)
and
UWS
patients
(n
=
15)
was
included
.


In
addition
,
four
MCS*
patients
were
added
along
with
the
same
participants
for
whom
TMS–EEG
was
recorded
.


The
sampling
rate
was
1450
Hz
.


Finally
,
among
previously
published
data
,
the
data
with
a
signal-to-noise
of
1
.

4
or
less
were
excluded
from
the
analysis¹⁶
.



Data
preprocessing

TMS–EEG
data
were
preprocessed
using
the
SiSyPhus
Project
MATLAB
program
(University
of
Milan
,
Italy)
and
the
EEGLAB
toolbox⁵⁷
.


The
signals
were
down-sampled
to
362
.

5
Hz
and
band-pass
filtered
between
0
.

5
and
45
Hz
using
a
second-order
Butterworth
filter
.


The
signals
of
−400
to
1000
ms
were
segmented
and
baseline-corrected
using
the
400
ms
baseline
before
the
TMS
pulses
.


Bad
channels
were
manually
detected
and
interpolated
using
superfast
spherical
interpolation
for
artifact
removal
.


We
also
discarded
the
components
related
to
eye
movements
using
independent
component
analysis
and
removed
trials
setting
a
threshold
of
±100
μv
affected
by
ocular
artifacts
,
other
artifacts
,
or
noise
.


The
data
were
re-referenced
to
an
average
reference^(58
,59)
.



Resting-state
EEG
data
were
processed
using
the
EEGLAB
toolbox⁵⁷
.


Preprocessing
was
performed
using
a
process
similar
to
that
used
with
TMS–EEG
data
,
with
segmentation
being
performed
every
1
s
.


The
number
of
trials
for
each
session
we
used
is
listed
for
patients
under
anesthesia
(Supplementary
Table 12)
and
severely
brain-injured
patients
(Supplementary
Table 13)
.



Proposed
framework
for
calculating
an
ECI

Step
1—Extraction
of
EEG
features
:
In
all
trials
of
all
TMS–EEG
data
,
we
used
the
200–400
ms
time
window
of
data
after
the
TMS
regardless
of
the
lateralization
or
target
site
of
the
TMS
in
sleep
,
anesthesia
,
and
for
patients
with
severe
brain
injury
.


More
details
related
to
this
deliberate
choice
are
reported
in
Supplementary
Note 2
.


In
resting-state
EEG
,
only
the
first
200
ms
of
data
were
used
from
the
segmented
1
s
of
data
.


In
the
first
step
,
EEG
data
were
converted
from
2D
raw
signals
to
3D
input
.


To
preserve
the
spatial
information
and
characteristics
of
EEG
,
we
used
spatio-spectral
and
spatiotemporal
3D
features
.


The
raw
EEG
signals
at
time
index
t
are
measured
in
a
1D
data
vector
\({r}_{t}={\left[{s}_{t}^{1}
,{s}_{t}^{2}
,{s}_{t}^{i}
,\cdots

,{s}_{t}^{n}\right]}^{T}\)
,
where
\({s}_{t}^{i}\)
is
the
acquisition
data
by
the
\(i\)th
electrode
channel
at
timestamp
t
.


n
indicates
the
number
of
electrode
channels
.


However
,
these
simple
signals
do
not
capture
all
the
spatial
information
characteristics
in
the
brain
.


Therefore
,
we
converted
1D
data
vectors
to
2D
EEG
data
meshes
using
the
spatial
information
of
the
electrode
location
.


Zero
was
inserted
in
the
place
of
a
null
electrode
in
2D
matrices
at
time
index
t⁶⁰
.


Finally
,
we
calculated
3D
data
by
adding
spectral
or
temporal
information
(Supplementary
Fig
.

 14)
.


Specifically
,
spectral
information
was
divided
into
5
frequency
bands
:
delta
(1
.

5–4
Hz)
,
theta
(4–8
Hz)
,
alpha
(8–13
Hz)
,
beta
(13–30
Hz)
,
and
gamma
bands
(30–40
Hz)⁴⁴
.


Finally
,
a
10
×
11
×
5
matrix
using
spectral
information
and a
10
×
11
×
72
matrix
using
temporal
information
were
used
as
the
final
CNN
inputs
(here
,
10
×
11
:
the
converted
matrix
of
spatial
information
;
5
:
delta
,
theta
,
alpha
,
beta
,
and
gamma
bands
of
spectral
information
;
72
:
200–400
ms
of
temporal
information)
.



Step
2—Calculation
of
interclass
probability
using
CNN
:
The
model
was
trained
to
distinguish
both
arousal
and
awareness
in
terms
of
whether
they
were
low
or
high
.


We
first
calculated
the
domain
similarity
based
on
the
cosine
distance
for
domain
transfer
learning
.


The
cosine
distance
D
between
domains
A
and
B
is
defined
as
follows
:

$$D\left(A
,\
,B\right)=1-\
,\frac{{f}_{A}^{{{{\rm
T}}}}{f}_{B}}{\parallel
{f}_{A}\parallel
\parallel
{f}_{B}\parallel}$$

(1)

where
\(\parallel
\bullet
\parallel\)
indicates
the
norm
of
a
vector
.


This
similarity
was
used
when
selecting
the
source
domain
for
domain
transfer
learning³⁸
.


In
calculating
the
similarity
according
to
the
states
of
arousal
and
awareness
,
the
labels
in
each
state
are
different
.


During
sleep
,
NREM
sleep
with
no
subjective
experience
and
REM
sleep
with
subjective
experience
were
learned
as
low
arousal
,
whereas
healthy
wakefulness
was
learned
as
high
arousal
.


Conversely
,
in
awareness
,
REM
sleep
with
subjective
experience
and
healthy
wakefulness
indicated
by
open
eyes
were
learned
as
high
awareness
,
while
NREM
sleep
with
no
subjective
experience
was
learned
as
low
awareness
.


Specifically
,
we
used
stage
3
of
NREM
sleep
for
clear
feature
extraction
of
deep
sleep
.


Under
general
anesthesia
and
in
healthy
wakefulness
before
anesthesia
,
the
arousal
state
was
divided
as
follows
:
(i)
low
,
when
under
ketamine
,
propofol
,
and
xenon-induced
anesthesia
,
and
(ii)
high
,
when
in
healthy
wakefulness
before
anesthesia
.


Conversely
,
the
awareness
state
was
divided
into
low
(under
propofol
and
xenon-induced
anesthesia)
and
high
(under
ketamine-induced
anesthesia
and
healthy
wakefulness
before
anesthesia)
.


Finally
,
in
patients
with
DoC
,
UWS
and
MCS
patients
were
distinguished
in
terms
of
awareness
:
low
(UWS
patients)
and
high
(MCS
patients)
.


The
UWS
and
MCS
patients
corresponded
to
high
arousal
.



Deep
learning
was
conducted
in
a
MATLAB
environment
powered
by
a
TITAN
V
GPU
.


We
used
the
LRP
toolbox³⁰
for
CNN
classification
and
interpretation
.


The
CNN
was
applied
to
the
two
components
of
consciousness
(arousal
and
awareness)
.


In
each
architecture
,
we
inserted
five
convolutional
layers
with
2D
filters
for
the
deep
neural
network
.


The
first
layer
with
100
filters
and
the
second
layer
with
80
filters
featured
kernel
sizes
of
3
×
3
and
2
×
2
with
stride
1
×
1
,
respectively
.


Then
,
a
max-pooling
layer
with
a
pool
size
of
2
×
2
and
stride
1
×
2
was
added
.


Similarly
,
two
convolutional
layers
with
kernel
sizes
of
3
×
3
(with
stride
1
×
1)
and
2
×
2
(with
stride
2
×
1)
were
subsequently
used
.


After
max-pooling
with
a
pool
size
of
2
×
1
and
stride
2
×
1
,
a
final
convolutional
layer
comprising
two
filters
with
a
kernel
size
of
1
×
1
and
stride
1
×
1
was
incorporated
.


Finally
,
the
generated
feature
maps
were
flattened
into
a
1D
vector
.


A
softmax
layer
was
used
for
classification
.


In
the
softmax
layer
,
each
element
indicates
the
probability
that
the
original
input
belongs
to
the
corresponding
class
.


In
this
training
procedure
,
the
parameters
in
the
deep
neural
network
were
learned
through
back-propagation
.


The
activation
function
in
each
convolutional
layer
was
a
rectified
linear
unit
.


The
detailed
CNN
architecture
is
presented
in
Supplementary
Table 14
.


The
Adam
optimizer
was
used
with
an
initial
learning
rate
of
0
.

005
,
and
the
learning
rate
was
updated
to
sublinear
for
learning
rate
decay
during
an
evaluation
step
of
training
.


Specifically
,
we
used
hyperparameters
as
values
of
0
.

9
for
β1
,
0
.

999
for
β2
for
Adam
optimizer⁶¹
.


The
batch
size
was
25
for
training
,
and
the
maximum
number
of
training
iterations
was
five
times
the
number
of
training
data
.


Consequently
,
the
output
of
this
architecture
was
the
probability
of
each
class
.



For
a
comparison
with
other
classifiers
,
we
also
considered
an
LDA
classifier⁶²
and
SVM
with
polynomial
kernel
function⁶³
using
the
same
input
data
as
fair
baseline
methods
.


The
classification
performance
was
measured
in
LOPO-nested
cross-validation
for
the
generalized
neural
network
.


This
method
is
a
special
case
of
k-fold
cross-validation
.


Specifically
,
all
participants
except
one
(the
target
participant)
were
used
for
training
,
and
the
target
participant
was
then
tested
using
the
classifier
.


In
the
training
phase
,
80%
of
the
datasets
were
used
to
learn
the
classifier
,
and
the
remaining
20%
were
reserved
for
validation
.


This
process
was
repeated
for
each
participant
.


Further
,
internal
validation
sets
(inner
cross-validation)
were
performed
to
choose
the
hyperparameters
of
the
model⁶⁴
.


Thus
,
the
same
hyperparameters
were
selected
in
the
external
validation
sets⁶⁵
.


The
LOPO
cross-validation
procedure
uses
data
efficiently
and
can
reduce
overfitting
.


It
also
provides
unbiased
estimates
of
the
averaged
classification
error
for
all
possible
training
sets⁶⁶
.


The
same
LOPO-nested
cross-validation
is
applied
in
LDA
and
SVM
using
the
Berlin
brain–computer
interface
toolbox⁶⁷
.


Three
possible
values
(0
.

0001
,
0
.

01
,
and
1)
were
chosen
as
penalties
for
misclassification
in
the
SVM
model⁶⁵
.


For
spatio-spectral
input
and
spatiotemporal
input
1
and
0
.

0001
were
used
respectively
.



Step
3—Calculation
of
ECI
in
a
single
session
:
We
obtained
each
interclass
probability
according
to
two
components
(arousal
and
awareness)
at
the
previous
step
.


In
each
TMS
session
,
the
interclass
probability
was
averaged
to
calculate
an
ECI
.


This
approach
has
the
advantage
of
being
able
to
offset
outliers
.



$${C}_{j}=\
,\frac{1}{N}\mathop{\sum
}\limits_{i=1}^{N}{p}_{i}$$

(2)

Here
,
\({p}_{i}\)
is
the
probability
of
high
arousal
or
high
awareness
from
each
trial
\(i\)
among
the
probability
values
(high
versus
low)
for
the
two
classes
from
the
softmax
function
in
the
CNN
.


N
is
the
number
of
trials
in
a
single
session
j
.


The
averaged
interclass
probability
\({C}_{j}\)
from
arousal
is
the
value
of
the
x-axis
as
ECI^(aro)
,
and
the
averaged
interclass
probability
\({C}_{j}\)
from
awareness
becomes
the
value
of
the
y-axis
as
ECI^(awa)
.


Consequently
,
ECI
is
expressed
as
a
2D
indicator
representing
both
arousal
and
awareness
simultaneously
.


As
mentioned
earlier
,
we
used
the
LOPO
cross-validation
.


It
is
to
be
noted
that
only
data
from
one
participant
were
used
as
the
test
,
and
the
data
from
the
remaining
participants
were
used
for
training
.


Finally
,
the
test
and
training
data
did
not
demonstrate
an
overlap
at
all
.



Step
4—Interpretation
using
LRP
:
We
used
LRP
based
on
a
backward-propagation
mechanism
for
interpretability
of
the
deep
neural
networks
.


This
calculated
the
pixel-based
decomposition
process²⁸
.



$$\mathop{\sum
}\limits_{p=1}^{d}{R}_{p}=f({{{{{\rm{x}}}}}})$$

(3)

Here
,
x
=
(\({x}_{1}
,\ldots
{x}_{d}\))
indicates
an
input
vector
and
\(f({{{{{\rm{x}}}}}})\)
is
the
model
output
.


The
relevance
score
\({R}_{p}\)
is
the
decomposition
of
the
prediction
for
the
input
\({x}_{p}\)
.


This
score
is
calculated
through
the
backward
propagation
of
the
model
input
.


Therefore
,
relevance
scores
describe
a
single
nonlinear
decision
for
the
output
corresponding
to
each
input⁶⁸
.


Through
this
method
,
we
can
observe
not
only
the
interpretation
of
classification
decisions
but
also
what
features
the
model
has
learned²⁸
.


To
investigate
which
brain
regions
and
signals
caused
these
classification
results
,
we
compared
the
relevance
scores
from
the
LRP
by
dividing
them
into
the
following
three
regions⁶⁹
:
the
frontal
(Fp1–2
,
Fpz
,
AF1–2
,
AFz
,
F1–8
,
and
Fz)
,
temporal
(FT9–10
,
T7–8
,
TP9–10)
,
and
parietal
(CP1–6
,
CPz
,
P1–4
,
P7–8
,
and
Pz)
regions
.


We
focused
on
the
frontal
,
temporal
,
and
parietal
regions
when
comparing
the
relevance
score
resulting
from
the
LRP
as
there
is
an
ongoing
debate
regarding
which
brain
area
,
i
.

e
.


,
the
front
versus
the
back
,
is
related
to
consciousness⁴⁰
.


We
also
included
the
temporal
region
as
activation
in
the
NREM
sleep
increases
in
this
region⁷⁰
.



Additional
EEG
analyses
are
shown
in Supplementary
Methods
as
follows
:
(i)
performance
according
to
the
number
of
trials
in
the
ECI
calculation
,
(ii)
comparison
of
the
difference
between
correct
and
incorrect
trials
,
and
(iii)
classification
performance
using
EEG
signals
excluding
frontal
or
parietal
electrodes
.



Comparison
with
PCI

We
compared
ECI^(awa)
with
the
PCI
values
computed
following
the
same
procedure
described
in¹⁶
.


PCI
measures
the
complexity
of
the
spatiotemporal
patterns
of
cortical
activity
significantly
evoked
by
TMS¹⁶
.


PCI
ranges
between
0
(minimum
complexity)
and
1
(maximum
complexity)
.


Previous
extensive
validation
of
PCI
provided
an
empirical
cutoff
(PCI*
=
0
.

31)
to
discriminate
between
consciousness
and
unconsciousness¹⁷
.



Statistical
analysis

We
used
the
Kruskal–Wallis
test
(nonparametric
one-way
analysis
of
variance)
to
analyze
the
differences
in
the
classification
accuracy
;
moreover
,
two-sided
multiple
t-tests
were
used
for
post-hoc
analysis
using
Fisher’s
least
significant
differences
method
for
multiple
comparisons
to
compare
the
classification
performance
of
the
three
classifiers
(LDA
,
SVM
,
and
CNN)
of
sleep
data
for
each
component
(arousal
and
awareness)
and
at
three-time
ranges
(0–200
,
200–400
,
400–600
ms)
of
spatiotemporal
information
.


The
Kruskal–Wallis
test
was
also
performed
to
compare
the
classification
performance
using
transfer
learning
.


Similarly
,
Fisher’s
least
significant
differences
method
was
applied
after
the
two-sided
multiple
t-tests
.



To
investigate
the
discrimination
of
ECI
in
each
state
of
consciousness
,
the
feedforward
network
was
trained
with
20
hidden
layers
using
the
LOPO
approach
.


For
each
output
class
,
the
AUC
,
sensitivity
,
and
specificity
were
calculated
using
ROC
analysis
.



The
Kruskal–Wallis
test
was
employed
to
investigate
if
there
were
any
differences
in
relevance
scores
among
brain
regions
from
LRP
under
sleep
.


We
performed
two-sided
multiple
t-tests
using
Fisher’s
least
significant
differences
method
for
multiple
comparisons
.


In
addition
,
the
Kruskal–Wallis
test
was
performed
to
explore
the
differences
in
relevance
scores
from
LRP
under
the
condition
of
anesthesia
and
for
severely
brain-injured
patients
.


For
post-hoc
analysis
,
two-sided
multiple
t-tests
were
performed
using
Fisher’s
least
significant
differences
method
for
multiple
comparisons
.



Finally
,
we
used
Pearson’s
correlation
to
investigate
the
relationship
between
ECI^(awa)
and
PCI
.


In
this
study
,
all
significances
were
indicated
by
\({{{{{\rm{\alpha
}}}}}}\)
=
0
.

Following
the
work
of
Georg
Wilhelm
Friedrich
Hegel
,
Karl
Marx
outlined
the
workings
of
a
political
consciousness
.



The
politics
of
consciousness

[edit]

Consciousness
typically
refers
to
the
idea
of
a
being
who
is
self-aware
.


It
is
a
distinction
often
reserved
for
human
beings
.


This
remains
the
original
and
most
common
usage
of
the
term
.


^([1])
For
Marx
,
consciousness
describes
a
person
'
s
political
sense
of
self
.


That
is
,
consciousness
describes
a
person
'
s
awareness
of
politics
.


For
Marx
,
an
authentic
consciousness
was
linked
to
understanding
one
'
s
true
position
in
History
.


While
Hegel
placed
God
behind
the
workings
of
consciousness
in
people
,
Marx
saw
the
political
economy
as
the
engine
of
mind
.

^([2])

In
the
20th
century
,
many
social
movements
and
intellectuals
have
developed
this
use
of
consciousness
.



False
consciousness

[edit]

Main
article
:
False
consciousness

In
Marx
'
s
view
,
consciousness
was
always
political
,
for
it
was
always
the
outcome
of
politic-economic
circumstances
.


What
one
thinks
of
life
,
power
,
and
self
,
for
Marx
,
is
always
a
product
of
ideological
forces
.



For
Marx
,
ideologies
appear
to
explain
and
justify
the
current
distribution
of
wealth
and
power
in
a
society
.


In
societies
with
unequal
allocations
of
wealth
and
power
,
ideologies
present
these
inequalities
as
acceptable
,
virtuous
,
inevitable
,
and
so
forth
.


Ideologies
thus
tend
to
lead
people
to
accept
the
status
quo
.


The
subordinate
people
come
to
believe
in
their
subordination
:
the
peasants
to
accept
the
rule
of
the
aristocracy
,
the
factory
workers
to
accept
the
rule
of
the
owners
,
consumers
the
rule
of
corporations
.


This
belief
in
one
'
s
own
subordination
,
which
comes
about
through
ideology
,
is
,
for
Marx
,
false
consciousness
.



That
is
,
conditions
of
inequality
create
ideologies
which
confuse
people
about
their
true
aspirations
,
loyalties
,
and
purposes
.

^([3])
Thus
,
for
example
,
the
working
class
has
often
been
,
for
Marx
,
beguiled
by
nationalism
,
organized
religion
,
and
other
distractions
.


These
ideological
devices
help
to
keep
people
from
realizing
that
it
is
they
who
produce
wealth
,
they
who
deserve
the
fruits
of
the
land
,
all
who
can
prosper
:
instead
of
literally
thinking
for
themselves
,
they
think
the
thoughts
given
to
them
by
the
ruling
class
.

^([4])

Consciousness
and
the
political-economy

[edit]

For
Marx
,
consciousness
is
a
reflection
of
the
political
economy
.


A
person
'
s
thoughts
tend
to
be
shaped
by
his
or
her
political
and
economic
circumstances
.


He
famously
wrote
,
"It
is
not
the
consciousness
of
men
that
determines
their
being
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
their
social
being
that
determines
their
consciousness
.

"


Perhaps
Marx
'
s
greatest
contribution
to
modern
thought
.


.


.


is
his

comprehensive
investigation
into
the
role
of
Ideology
,
or
how
social

being
determines
consciousness
,
which
results
in
certain
(for
the
most

part
unconscious)
belief
and
value
systems
depending
on
the
particular

economic
infrastructure
pertaining
at
the
time
.


From
a
Marxian
point

of
view
all
cultural
artifacts--religious
systems
,
philosophical

positions
,
ethical
values--are
,
naturally
enough
,
products
of

consciousness
and
as
such
are
subject
to
these
ideological

pressures
.

Critical
consciousness
,
conscientization
,
or
conscientização
in
Portuguese
(

Portuguese
pronunciation
:
[kõsjẽtʃizaˈsɐ̃w])
,
is
a
popular
education
and
social
concept
developed
by
Brazilian
pedagogue
and
educational
theorist
Paulo
Freire
,
grounded
in
neo-Marxist
critical
theory
.


Critical
consciousness
focuses
on
achieving
an
in-depth
understanding
of
the
world
,
allowing
for
the
perception
and
exposure
of
social
and
political
contradictions
.


Critical
consciousness
also
includes
taking
action
against
the
oppressive
elements
in
one
'
s
life
that
are
illuminated
by
that
understanding
.

^([1])

Coinage

[edit]

The
English
term
conscientization
is
a
translation
of
the
Portuguese
term
conscientização
,
which
is
also
translated
as
"consciousness
raising"
and
"critical
consciousness"
.


The
term
was
popularized
by
Brazilian
educator
,
activist
,
and
theorist
Paulo
Freire
in
his
1970
work
Pedagogy
of
the
Oppressed
.


Freire
was
teaching
the
poor
and
illiterate
members
of
Brazilian
society
to
read
at
a
time
when
literacy
was
a
requirement
for
suffrage
and
dictators
ruled
many
South
American
countries
.


The
term
originally
derives
from
Frantz
Fanon
'
s
coinage
of
a
French
term
,
conscientiser
,
in
his
1952
book
,
Black
Skins
,
White
Masks
.

^([2])

Overview

[edit]

Paulo
Freire
defines
critical
consciousness
as
the
ability
to
intervene
in
reality
in
order
to
change
it
.

^([3])
Critical
consciousness
proceeds
through
the
identification
of
"generative
themes"
,
which
Freire
identifies
as
"iconic
representations
that
have
a
powerful
emotional
impact
in
the
daily
lives
of
learners
.

"
In
this
way
,
individual
consciousness
helps
end
the
"culture
of
silence"
in
which
the
socially
dispossessed
internalize
the
negative
images
of
themselves
created
and
propagated
by
the
oppressor
in
situations
of
extreme
poverty
.


Liberating
learners
from
this
mimicry
of
the
powerful
,
and
from
the
fratricidal
violence
that
results
therefrom
is
a
major
goal
of
critical
consciousness
.


Critical
consciousness
is
a
fundamental
aspect
of
Freire
'
s
concept
of
popular
education
.



Arlene
Goldbard
,
an
author
on
the
subject
of
community
cultural
development
finds
the
concept
of
conscientization
to
be
a
foundation
of
community
cultural
development
.


From
the
glossary
of
Goldbard
'
s
2006
book
New
Creative
Community
:
"Conscientization
is
an
ongoing
process
by
which
a
learner
moves
toward
critical
consciousness
.


This
process
is
the
heart
of
liberatory
education
.


It
differs
from
"consciousness
raising"
in
that
the
latter
may
involve
transmission
of
preselected
knowledge
.


Conscientization
means
engaging
in
praxis
,
in
which
one
both
reflects
and
takes
action
on
their
social
reality
to
break
through
prevailing
mythologies
and
reach
new
levels
of
awareness—in
particular
,
awareness
of
oppression
,
being
an
"object"
of
others’
will
rather
than
a
self-determining
"subject"
.


The
process
of
conscientization
involves
identifying
contradictions
in
experience
through
dialogue
and
becoming
part
of
the
process
of
changing
the
world
.

"^([4])

History
of
application

[edit]

The
ancient
Greeks
first
identified
the
essence
of
critical
consciousness
when
philosophers
encouraged
their
students
to
develop
an
"impulse
and
willingness
to
stand
back
from
humanity
and
nature
.


.


.


[and]
to
make
them
objects
of
thought
and
criticism
,
and
to
search
for
their
meaning
and
significance
.

^([5])
In
his
books
Pedagogy
of
the
Oppressed^([6])
and
Education
for
Critical
Consciousness
,^([3])
Freire
explains
critical
consciousness
as
a
sociopolitical
educative
tool
that
engages
learners
in
questioning
the
nature
of
their
historical
and
social
situation
,
which
Freire
addressed
as
"reading
the
world"
.


The
goal
of
critical
consciousness
,
according
to
Freire
,
should
be
acting
as
subjects
in
the
creation
of
democratic
society
.


In
education
,
Freire
implies
intergenerational
equity
between
students
and
teachers
in
which
both
learn
,
both
question
,
both
reflect
and
both
participate
in
meaning-making
.


Using
this
idea
,
and
describing
current
instructional
methods
as
homogenization
and
lockstep
standardization
,
alternative
approaches
are
proposed
,
such
as
the
Sudbury
model
,
an
alternative
approach
in
which
children
,
by
enjoying
personal
freedom
thus
encouraged
to
exercise
personal
responsibility
for
their
actions
,
learn
at
their
own
pace
rather
than
following
a
previously
imposed
chronologically-based
curriculum
.

^([7][8][9])
In
a
similar
form
students
learn
all
the
subjects
,
techniques
and
skills
in
these
schools
.


The
staff
are
minor
actors
,
the
"teacher"
is
an
adviser
and
helps
just
when
asked
.

^([10][11])
The
Sudbury
model
maintains
that
values
,
social
justice
,
critical
consciousness
,
intergenerational
equity
,
and
political
consciousness
included
,
must
be
learned
through
experience
,^([12][13][14][15])
as
Aristotle
said
:
"For
the
things
we
have
to
learn
before
we
can
do
them
,
we
learn
by
doing
them
.

"^([16])

Picking
up
on
Freire
'
s
definition
of
critical
consciousness
,
Joe
L
.


Kincheloe
has
expanded
the
definition
of
the
concept
in
his
work
on
postformalism
.


In
Kincheloe
'
s
formulation
postformalism
connects
cognition
to
critical
theoretical
questions
of
power
and
social
justice
.


In
this
context
Kincheloe
constructs
a
critical
theory
of
cognition
that
explores
questions
of
meaning
,
emancipation
vis-a-vis
ideological
inscription
,
and
a
particular
focus
on
the
socio-political
construction
of
the
self
.


With
these
concerns
in
mind
Kincheloe
'
s
postformal
critical
consciousness
engages
questions
of
purpose
,
issues
of
human
dignity
,
freedom
,
authority
,
reconceptualized
notions
of
reason
,
intellectual
quality
,
and
social
responsibility
.


Postformal
critical
consciousness
stimulates
a
conversation
between
critical
pedagogy
and
a
wide
range
of
social
,
cultural
,
political
economic
,
psychological
,
and
philosophical
concerns
.


Kincheloe
employs
this
"multilogical
conversation"
to
shape
new
modes
of
self-awareness
,
more
effective
forms
of
social
,
political
,
and
pedagogical
action
,
and
an
elastic
model
of
an
evolving
critical
consciousness
(Kincheloe
and
Steinberg
,
1993
;
Kincheloe
,
1999
;
Thomas
and
Kincheloe
,
2006)
.



Freire
'
s
development
of
critical
consciousness
has
been
expanded
upon
in
several
academic
disciplines
and
common
applications
.

^([17])
Public
health
community
collaborations
focused
on
HIV
prevention
for
women
,^([18])
the
role
of
critical
consciousness
in
adult
education
,^([19])
and
the
effect
of
peer
pressure
on
cigarette
smokers^([20])
Freire
'
s
notion
of
critical
consciousness
is
,
in
part
,
a
type
of
political
consciousness
.



In
educational
programs
for
youth
and
adolescents
,
some
instructors
have
implemented
curricula
aimed
at
encouraging
students
to
develop
a
critical
consciousness
within
subject-specific
material
.

^([21])
Instructors
can
teach
language
arts
,^([22])
science
,^([23])
and
social
science^([24])
lessons
while
guiding
students
to
connect
academic
material
to
their
experiences
,
explore
themes
of
social
justice
,
and
discuss
these
ideas
collaboratively
in
the
classroom
.



In
application
,
raising
critical
consciousness
in
young
students
can
lead
to
successful
outcomes
in
terms
of
students
'

social-emotional
well-being
,^([25])
academic
performance
,^([26])
and
increased
pursuit
of
careers
after
completing
high
school
.

^([27][28])
While
some
studies
provide
support
for
developing
critical
consciousness
in
students
due
to
the
potential
benefits
,
other
studies
present
conflicting
results
.


For
example
,
research
has
also
shown
that
students
who
demonstrate
lower
critical
consciousness
levels
may
experience
less
depressed
moods^([29])
and
higher
grades
.

^([30])
Due
to
limitations
associated
with
the
predominantly
qualitative
designs
of
many
studies
on
critical
consciousness
in
education
,
further
research
is
needed
using
rigorous
,
controlled
quantitative
designs
to
more
clearly
understand
the
relationship
between
critical
consciousness
and
young
students’
trajectory
.

Internal
conflict
of
society
'
s
oppressed

Not
to
be
confused
with
Dual
consciousness
.



Double
consciousness
is
the
dual
self-perception^([1])
experienced
by
subordinated
or
colonized
groups
in
an
oppressive
society
.


The
term
and
the
idea
were
first
published
in
W
.


E
.


B
.


Du
Bois
'
s
autoethnographic
work
,
The
Souls
of
Black
Folk
in
1903
,
in
which
he
described
the
African
American
experience
of
double
consciousness
,
including
his
own
.

^([2])

Originally
,
double
consciousness
was
specifically
the
psychological
challenge
African
Americans
experienced
of
"always
looking
at
one
'
s
self
through
the
eyes"
of
a
racist
white
society
and
"measuring
oneself
by
the
means
of
a
nation
that
looked
back
in
contempt"
.

^([2])
The
term
also
referred
to
Du
Bois
'
s
experiences
of
reconciling
his
African
heritage
with
an
upbringing
in
a
European-dominated
society
.

^([3])

Origin

[edit]

[]

Title
page
of
a
1903
book
in
which
Du
Bois
'

essay
about
double-consciousness
was
re-published

The
term
was
introduced
by
Ralph
Waldo
Emerson
in
his
1842
essay
"The
Transcendentalist"
.


Du
Bois
first
used
the
term
in
an
article
titled
"Strivings
of
the
Negro
People"
,
published
in
the
August
1897
issue
of
the
Atlantic
Monthly
.

^([4])
It
was
later
republished
and
slightly
edited
under
the
title
"Of
Our
Spiritual
Strivings"
in
his
book
,
The
Souls
of
Black
Folk
.


Du
Bois
describes
double
consciousness
as
follows
:


It
is
a
peculiar
sensation
,
this
double-consciousness
,
this
sense
of

always
looking
at
one
'
s
self
through
the
eyes
of
others
,
of
measuring

one
'
s
soul
by
the
tape
of
a
world
that
looks
on
in
amused
contempt
and

pity
.


One
ever
feels
his
two-ness
,—an
American
,
a
Negro
;
two
souls
,

two
thoughts
,
two
unreconciled
strivings
;
two
warring
ideals
in
one

dark
body
,
whose
dogged
strength
alone
keeps
it
from
being
torn

asunder
.


The
history
of
the
American
Negro
is
the
history
of
this

strife –
this
longing
to
attain
self-conscious
manhood
,
to
merge
his

double
self
into
a
better
and
truer
self
.


In
this
merging
he
wishes

neither
of
the
older
selves
to
be
lost
.


He
does
not
wish
to
Africanize

America
,
for
America
has
too
much
to
teach
the
world
and
Africa
.


He

wouldn
'
t
bleach
his
Negro
blood
in
a
flood
of
white
Americanism
,
for

he
knows
that
Negro
blood
has
a
message
for
the
world
.


He
simply

wishes
to
make
it
possible
for
a
man
to
be
both
a
Negro
and
an

American
without
being
cursed
and
spit
upon
by
his
fellows
,
without

having
the
doors
of
opportunity
closed
roughly
in
his
face
.

^([2])

Modern
conceptions

[edit]

The
concept
of
double
consciousness
has
been
expanded
on
by
many
different
scholars
in
the
20th
and
early
21st
centuries
.


Commentators
have
examined
how
the
concept
can
be
expanded
to
other
aspects
of
the
African
American
experience
,
or
for
other
marginalized
groups
who
experience
a
similar
forms
of
oppression
.

^([5])

Gilroy
and
the
"Black
Atlantic"

[edit]

Paul
Gilroy
applied
theories
of
culture
and
race
to
the
study
and
construction
of
African
American
intellectual
history
.


He
is
known
especially
for
marking
a
turning
point
in
the
study
of
the
African
diasporas
.

^([6])
His
book
The
Black
Atlantic
:
Modernity
and
Double
Consciousness
(1993)
introduces
the
"Black
Atlantic"
as
a
source
for
cultural
construction
.

^([7])
Gilroy
pioneers
a
shift
in
contemporary
black
studies
by
arguing
for
a
rejection
of
the
notion
of
a
homogeneous
nation-state
based
nationality
in
favor
of
analyzing
"the
Atlantic
as
one
single
,
complex
unit
of
analysis
in
their
discussions
of
the
modern
world
and
use
it
to
produce
an
explicitly
transnational
and
intercultural
perspective"
.

^([8])
He
based
this
on
the
Atlantic
slave
trade
and
marked
it
as
the
foundation
for
the
diaspora
.


He
recognized
the
significance
of
European
and
African
transnational
travel
as
a
foundation
for
double
consciousness
.


Gilroy
used
Du
Bois
'
s
theory
of
double
consciousness
to
suggest
there
exists
an
internal
struggle
to
reconcile
being
both
European
and
Black
,
which
was
his
main
focus
in
his
book
.

^([7])
He
even
characterized
the
Black
Atlantic
by
the
influence
of
slave
trade
"routes"
on
black
identity
.


He
aimed
to
unify
black
culture
with
the
connection
to
the
homeland
as
well
as
the
cultural
exchanges
that
occurred
afterward
.


Gilroy
'
s
work
became
popular
with
the
Black
diaspora
in
Europe
,
and
his
theories
became
the
foundation
for
several
black
power
movements
throughout
the
continent
.

^([9])

Gilroy
argues
that
occupying
the
space
between
these
two
dialectal
subjectivities
is
"viewed
as
a
provocative
and
even
oppositional
act
of
political
insubordination"
.

^([8])
This
means
that
for
black
people
across
diaspora
,
thinking
of
the
duality
in
their
identity
as
one
is
almost
paradoxical
,
and
conceptualizing
and
actualizing
this
is
a
move
of
symbolic
resistance
in
modernity
.

Frantz
Fanon

[edit]

Very
similarly
to
Du
Bois
,
Frantz
Fanon
touched
upon
the
term
of
double
consciousness
in
his
life
.


In
his
first
book
,
Black
Skin
,
White
Masks
,
where
he
expressed
his
hopelessness
at
being
neither
white
nor
black
.


Fanon
identifies
the
double
consciousness
that
African
Americans
face
and
its
source
;
he
claimed
the
cultural
and
social
confusions
of
African
Americans
were
caused
by
European
culture
.

^([10])
He
gave
examples
of
things
that
he
has
encountered
that
demonstrate
the
double
consciousness
.


He
talks
about
people
who
preach
about
completely
conforming
to
being
white
and
says
that
they
are
wrong
.


He
also
says
that
the
people
who
believe
that
complete
rejection
of
whites
are
also
wrong
.

^([11])

He
then
proceeds
to
talk
about
why
black
people
adopt
cultures
that
are
so
strange
to
him
.


He
talks
about
how
when
a
Black
Caribbean
leaves
for
Europe
,
they
come
back
speaking
a
language
different
from
their
own
.


He
also
talks
about
how
Africans
,
mostly
the
wealthiest
,
tend
to
have
insecurities
of
not
being
European
enough
because
they
are
African
.


This
manifests
in
buying
European
furniture
and
buying
European
clothes
.

^([11])

In
addition
to
this
he
talks
about
the
way
white
men
talk
to
African
Americans
and
how
it
contributes
to
this
problem
of
double
consciousness
.


He
says
that
when
a
white
man
talks
to
an
African
American
man
he
is
changing
his
language
to
a
way
in
which
a
stereotypical
black
man
would
talk
,
similarly
to
how
one
would
talk
to
a
child
,
with
different
language
sophistication
and
slang
.


He
says
that
this
angers
the
African
American
because
he
feels
as
though
he
has
been
categorized
and
imprisoned
into
a
box
from
which
he
cannot
escape
due
to
this
judgement
.


He
gives
an
example
of
a
film
where
this
stereotype
is
portrayed
and
then
talks
about
how
African
Americans
need
to
be
educated
to
not
follow
the
stereotypes
displayed
by
white
culture
.

^([12])

Stephen
Greenblatt
also
uses
it
to
describe
the
peculiar
quality
of
Shakespeare
'
s
consciousness
in
his
biography
of
the
bard
,
Will
in
the
World
(2004)
.

^([13])

Triple
consciousness

[edit]

In
the
21st
century
,
Du
Bois
'
s
theory
of
double
consciousness
has
been
revisited
to
develop
a
more
inclusive
concept
of
triple
consciousness
.


This
triple
consciousness
may
include
another
intersecting
identity
that
impacts
a
person
'
s
social
experiences
.


Additional
identities
that
may
affect
the
already
present
double
consciousness
experience
might
include
ethnicity
,
gender
,
sexual
orientation
,
etc
.


For
example
,
Juan
Flores
identified
ethnicity
as
a
potential
aspect
that
influences
double
consciousness
by
speculating
Afro-Latinos
in
the
U
.

S
.


experienced
an
added
layer
of
discrimination
that
combined
skin
color
with
ethnicity
and
nationality
.

^([14])
Anna
Julia
Cooper
similarly
references
the
intersectionality
of
race
and
gender
within
her
work
A
Voice
from
the
South
where
she
states
:
"Only
the
black
woman
can
say

'
when
and
where
I
enter
,
in
the
quiet
,
undisputed
dignity
of
my
womanhood
,
without
violence
and
without
suing
or
special
patronage
,
then
and
there
the
whole
.


.


.


race
enters
with
me"
.

^([15])
Finally
,
Jossianna
Arroyo
explains
that
triple
consciousness
brings
"spaces
,
culture
,
and
skin
.


.


.


[to]
re-contextualize
blackness"^([16])
in
the
case
of
black
Puerto
Ricans
.



Experiences
of
women
of
color

[edit]

Just
like
any
other
thought
in
critical
race
analysis
,
double
consciousness
theory
cannot
be
divorced
from
gender
.


This
is
where
black
feminists
have
introduced
their
concept
of
the
triple
consciousness
.

^([17])
Black
women
not
only
have
to
see
themselves
through
the
lens
of
blackness
and
whiteness
,
but
also
through
the
lens
of
patriarchy
.


Whenever
they
are
in
black
spaces
,
women
still
have
to
situate
themselves
in
the
context
of
patriarchy
.


Whenever
they
are
in
fem
spaces
,
they
must
still
situate
themselves
in
the
context
of
their
blackness
.


Deborah
Gray
White
writes
,
"African
American
women
are
confronted
with
an
impossible
task
.


If
she
is
rescued
from
the
myth
of
the
negro
,
the
myth
of
the
woman
traps
her
.


If
she
escapes
the
myth
of
the
women
,
the
myth
of
the
negro
still
ensnares
her"
.

^([18])

Among
the
double
burdens
that
feminists
faced
was
fighting
for
women
'
s
rights
as
well
as
rights
for
people
of
color
.


Frances
M
.


Beale
wrote
that
the
situation
of
black
women
was
full
of
misconceptions
and
distortions
of
the
truth
.


In
her
pamphlet
Double
Jeopardy
:
To
Be
Black
and
Female
,
she
claimed
that
capitalism
was
the
direct
forebear
of
racism
because
the
system
was
indirectly
a
way
to
destroy
the
humanity
of
black
people
.

^([19])

"In
any
society
where
men
are
not
yet
free
,
women
are
less
free
because
we
are
further
enslaved
because
we
[African
American
women]
are
enslaved
by
our
sex
.

"
Many
African
American
women
turned
towards
feminism
in
their
fight
against
oppression
because
"there
was
an
awareness
that
they
were
being
treated
as
second-class
citizens
within
the
Civil
Rights
movement
of
the
60
'
s
.

"
Due
to
this
,
many
women
felt
that
they
were
being
asked
to
choose
between
"a
Black
movement
that
primarily
served
the
interest
of
Black
male
patriarchs
,
and
a
women
'
s
movement
which
primarily
served
the
interests
of
racist
white
women
.

"

The
theory
of
double
consciousness
is
also
heavily
present
for
female
diasporic
artists
.


These
artists
are
faced
with
the
task
of
remaining
authentic
to
their
roots
while
still
branding
themselves
in
a
way
to
allow
international
and
mainstream
popularity
.


In
the
music
industry
,
women
of
color
are
often
stereotyped
as
being
hyper-sexual
and
aggressive
;
which
in
some
cases
helps
their
branding
,
and
in
other
cases
,
it
hurts
their
branding
and
the
identity
they
have
attempted
to
create
for
themselves
.


Due
to
this
,
diasporic
female
artists
are
often
forced
to
privilege
certain
self
markers
and
conceal
others
depending
on
the
situation
;
often
making
them
feel
as
if
they
can
never
create
one
true
identity
for
themselves
but
must
rather
change
depending
on
the
circumstances
present
.

Black
Power

[edit]

The
first
portion
of
Black
Power
:
The
Politics
of
Liberation
,
labeled
"White
Power"
,
by
Kwame
Ture
(formerly
known
as
Stokely
Carmichael)
and
Charles
V
.


Hamilton
,
provides
evidence
backing
up
the
ideology
of
double
consciousness
in
regards
to
black
people
in
the
United
States
.


The
book
opens
up
by
defining
racism
as
"the
predication
of
decisions
and
policies
on
considerations
of
race
for
the
purpose
of
subordinating
a
racial
group
and
maintaining
control
over
that
group"
(Hamilton
&
Ture
,
3)
.


Therefore
,
the
subordinate
group
,
black
people
,
must
think
of
themselves
in
terms
of
the
oppressive
population
,
white
.


Individual
racism
and
institutional
racism
both
contribute
to
double
consciousness
.


On
an
individual
level
,
double
consciousness
is
practiced
within
every
day
interactions
,
and
on
an
institutional
level
,
it
impacts
how
black
people
function
throughout
society
.


"Black
People
are
legal
citizens
of
the
United
States
with
,
for
the
most
part
,
the
same
legal
rights
as
other
citizens
.


Yet
they
stand
as
colonial
subjects
in
relation
to
the
white
society
.

"^([20])
Therefore
,
while
the
Black
population
in
the
United
States
are
essentially
equal
to
whites
under
written
law
,
there
remain
deeply
rooted
inequities
between
the
races
that
reinforce
double
consciousness
.


Because
these
differences
are
not
evident
under
the
U
.

S
.


Constitution
and
the
Bill
of
Rights
,
they
are
an
experience
.



In
the
Afro-German
paradigm

[edit]

Even
though
the
framework
of
double
consciousness
can
be
applied
to
an
African
Diaspora
and
Transnationality
,
the
nuances
of
racial
dynamics
differ
from
nation
to
nation
.


In
Germany
,
for
example
,
the
political
exigencies
enforced
by
the
Third
Reich
created
a
more
nuanced
situation
.


Tina
Campt
notes
in
Other
Germans
:
Black
Germans
and
the
Politics
of
Race
,
Gender
,
and
Memory
in
the
Third
Reich
,
the
tension
for
Afro-Germans
who
"came
of
age
during
the
totalitarian
regime
of
the
Third
Reich
.


.


.


was
not
necessarily
experienced
as
one
of
absolute
duality
or

'
twoness
.


'

Rather
,
it
was
a
contradictory
and
complexly
textured
form
of
identity"
.

^([21])
Due
to
the
absence
of
a
Black
community
in
Germany
,
"most
Afro-Germans
did
not
have
the
option
of
choosing
between
a
Black
community
or
identity
and
a
German
identity"
.

^([21])
They
were
essentially
forced
to
"occupy
a
position
between
a
conception
of
German
identity
that
excluded
blackness
and
a
conception
of
blackness
that
precluded
any
identification
with
Germanness"
.

^([21])
This
means
that
for
Black
Germans
during
the
Third
Reich
,
the
psychological
dilemmas
of
"two-ness"
did
not
necessarily
map
onto
the
double
consciousness
dynamic
W

first
identified
in
1897
.


For
Black
Germans
in
the
early
20th
century
,
there
was
no
stable
idea
or
community
of
blackness
with
which
they
could
fully
,
or
even
partly
,
identify
.

Phenomenon
of
group
members
advocating
shared
interests

Group
consciousness
in
political
science
refers
to
the
phenomenon
in
which
members
within
a
social
identity
group
become
aware
of
how
their
group
identification
impacts
their
position
in
society
,
and
therefore
come
together
to
pursue
collective
action
to
advocate
for
their
shared
interests
.

^([1][2])
Group
consciousness
requires
two
necessary
preconditions
:
group
membership
,
and
group
identification
.

^([1])
Group
membership
is
the

'
objective
'

belonging
within
the
group
,
while
identification
refers
to
the
subjective
psychological
importance
of
the
group
to
the
member
.

^([1])
Group
consciousness
has
been
studied
,
for
example
,
among
women
,^([3])
Hispanic
and
Latino
Americans
,^([4])
and
Muslim
Americans
.

^([5])

The
intent
behind
group
consciousness

[edit]

Group
consciousness
is
not
automatically
assumed
to
exist
with
any
organization
of
people
.


However
,
group
consciousness
often
stems
from
the
existence
of
group
agents
.


These
organizations
bring
people
together
through
common
purposes
and
intentions
that
they
act
upon
.


Some
examples
of
group
agents
include
courts
,
corporations
,
NGOs
,
and
other
collectives
of
individuals
.

^([6])
Group
consciousness
requires
unity
through
the
group
'
s
belief
in
a
set
of
"ideological
beliefs
about
one
'
s
group
'
s
social
standing
.

"
Groups
also
take
on
the
view
that
to
improve
their
social
standing
and
best
reach
their
goals
,
the
best
policy
is
to
pursue
collective
action
.

^([7])

Beyond
formal
organizations
like
corporations
and
nonprofits
,
group
consciousness
is
often
linked
to
socially
stratified
groups
,
including
class
,
gender
,
race
,
etc
.


When
discussing
racial
consciousness
specifically
,
group
consciousness
emerges
from
the
notion
that
people
'
s
identities
are
inseparable
from
their
race
.


As
a
result
,
minority
groups
,
particularly
oppressed
minority
groups
,
band
together
to
find
a
source
of
communal
support
.


In
America
specifically
,
African-Americans
specifically
have
been
historically
treated
as
part
of
a
racial
group
,
instead
of
recognized
for
their
individual
identities
.


Researchers
have
therefore
connected
this
idea
of
"linked
fate
,"
meaning
the
viewpoint
that
one
'
s
fate
is
"inextricably
linked
to
the
fate
of
their
racial
group"
to
a
heightened
sense
of
group
consciousness
.

^([7])

Current
debate
regarding
group
consciousness
qualifications

[edit]

One
key
point
of
contention
within
the
philosophy
is
whether
or
not
the
“consciousness”
of
a
group
can
be
phenomenal
,
meaning
experiential
,
or
if
it
is
purely
a
sense
of
awareness
.

argument
has
been
made
that
entire
states
can
be
“phenomenally
conscious
,”
meaning
they
can
subjectively
experience
perceptions
and
sensations
as
one
entity
.


In
his
paper
“If
Materialism
is
True
,
the
United
States
is
Probably
Conscious
,”
philosopher
Eric
Schwitzgebel
argues
that
the
United
States
experiences
a
consciousness
that
overrides
individual
citizens
.


Schwitzgebel
posits
that
through
using
materialist
philosophy
,
it
may
be
argued
that
the
United
States
has
the
characteristics
also
present
in
what
materialists
consider
to
be
“conscious
beings
.

”
In
this
case
,
we
can
take
materialism
to
mean
the
belief
that
solely
matter
,
rather
than
the
mind
or
ideas
,
can
be
treated
as
real
objects
.


In
the
context
of
group
consciousness
,
this
refers
to
the
controversial
debate
over
whether
a
group
can
function
as
its
own
being
,
or
if
group
consciousness
is
primarily
a
metaphor
.


Schwitzgebel
believes
in
the
former
.


He
states
that
the
US
is
self-preserving
,
goal-oriented
,
and
can
respond
intelligently
to
threats
and
opportunities
.


The
US
functions
as
an
individual
entity
.


Thus
,
the
United
States
can
be
said
to
have
a
concrete
identity
through
Schwitzgebel
'
s
interpretation
of
group
consciousness
.

^([8])

However
,
philosophers
like
Christian
List
also
posit
that
group
agents
are
not
necessarily
phenomenally
conscious
.


Within
his
paper
,
"What
Is
It
Like
to
Be
a
Group
Agent
?

"
he
argues
that
there
is
an
important
distinction
that
must
be
made
between
consciousness
as
awareness
and
as
experience
.


List
posits
that
group
agents
are
able
to
have
consciousness
as
awareness
.


A
group
agent
may
share
beliefs
and
act
on
then
,
but
it
is
the
individuals
in
this
group
,
who
are
aware
of
their
shared
identity
,
who
are
performing
the
action
.


Group
consciousness
thus
doesn
'
t
mean
that
a
group
can
act
as
a
true
collective
singular
;
it
only
facilitates
collective
action
.

Group
consciousness
within
feminism

[edit]

Feminist
consciousness
is
defined
as
"politicized
gender
identification
,"
which
is
when
women
link
their
gender
identity
and
the
societal
issues
that
arise
alongside
it
with
a
set
of
political
beliefs
.


Based
on
research
regarding
women
'
s
rights
activism
,
personality
and
life
experiences
can
be
seen
as
factors
that
lead
to
feminist
consciousness
.


For
instance
,
women
who
are
more
politically
engaged
tend
to
embrace
feminism
and
feminist
activism
than
women
who
are
not
.


In
addition
,
women
with
intersectional
identities
,
meaning
women
who
identify
with
more
than
one
marginalized
female
identity
,
are
also
more
likely
to
be
very
aware
of
their
group
membership
and
thus
develop
group
consciousness
.


For
example
,
lesbians
experience
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sexual
orientation
and
gender
;
they
are
therefore
more
likely
to
be
aware
of
their
oppression
and
seek
solace
in
group
solidarity
.

^([9])
Viewing
feminism
as
a
case
study
for
group
consciousness
demonstrates
how
even
within
collective
action
entities
,
there
are
outside
factors
that
influence
the
extent
to
which
members
are
willing
to
participate
.

Self-Consciousness

First
published

substantive
revision

Human
beings
are
conscious
not
only
of
the
world
around
them
but
also
of
themselves
:
their
activities
,
their
bodies
,
and
their
mental
lives
.


They
are
,
that
is
,
self-conscious
(or
,
equivalently
,
self-aware)
.


Self-consciousness
can
be
understood
as
an
awareness
of
oneself
.


But
a
self-conscious
subject
is
not
just
aware
of
something
that
merely
happens
to
be
themselves
,
as
one
is
if
one
sees
an
old
photograph
without
realising
that
it
is
of
oneself
.


Rather
a
self-conscious
subject
is
aware
of
themselves
as
themselves
;
it
is
manifest
to
them
that
they
themselves
are
the
object
of
awareness
.


Self-consciousness
is
a
form
of
consciousness
that
is
paradigmatically
expressed
in
English
by
the
words
“I”
,
“me”
,
and
“my”
,
terms
that
each
of
us
uses
to
refer
to
ourselves
as
such
.



A
central
topic
throughout
the
history
of
philosophy—and
increasingly
so
since
the
seventeenth
century—the
phenomena
surrounding
self-consciousness
prompt
a
variety
of
fundamental
philosophical
and
scientific
questions
,
including
its
relation
to
consciousness
;
its
semantic
and
epistemic
features
;
its
realisation
in
both
conceptual
and
non-conceptual
representation
;
and
its
connection
to
our
conception
of
an
objective
world
populated
with
others
like
ourselves
.

Self-Consciousness
in
the
History
of
Philosophy

A
familiar
feature
of
ancient
Greek
philosophy
and
culture
is
the
Delphic
maxim
“Know
Thyself”
.


But
what
is
it
that
one
knows
if
one
knows
oneself
?


In
Sophocles’
Oedipus
,
Oedipus
knows
a
number
of
things
about
himself
,
for
example
that
he
was
prophesied
to
kill
Laius
.


But
although
he
knew
this
about
himself
,
it
is
only
later
in
the
play
that
he
comes
to
know
that
it
is
he
himself
of
whom
it
is
true
.


That
is
,
he
moves
from
thinking
that
the
son
of
Laius
and
Jocasta
was
prophesied
to
kill
Laius
,
to
thinking
that
he
himself
was
so
prophesied
.


It
is
only
this
latter
knowledge
that
we
would
call
an
expression
of
self-consciousness
and
that
,
we
may
presume
,
is
the
object
of
the
Delphic
maxim
.


During
the
course
of
the
drama
Oedipus
comes
to
know
himself
,
with
tragic
consequences
.


But
just
what
this
self-consciousness
amounts
to
,
and
how
it
might
be
connected
to
other
aspects
of
the
mind
,
most
notably
consciousness
itself
,
is
less
clear
.


It
has
,
perhaps
unsurprisingly
,
been
the
topic
of
considerable
discussion
since
the
Greeks
.


During
the
early
modern
period
self-consciousness
became
central
to
a
number
of
philosophical
issues
and
,
with
Kant
and
the
post-Kantians
,
came
to
be
seen
as
one
of
the
most
important
topics
in
epistemology
and
the
philosophy
of
mind
.

Ancient
and
Medieval
Discussions
of
Self-Consciousness

Although
it
is
occasionally
suggested
that
a
concern
with
self-consciousness
is
a
peculiarly
modern
phenomenon
,
originating
with
Descartes
(Brinkmann
2005)
,
it
is
in
fact
the
topic
of
lively
ancient
and
medieval
debates
,
many
of
which
prefigure
early
modern
and
contemporary
concerns
(Sorabji
2006)
.


Aristotle
,
for
example
,
claims
that
a
person
must
,
while
perceiving
any
thing
,
also
perceive
their
own
existence
(De
Sensu
7
.

448a)
,
a
claim
suggestive
of
the
view
that
consciousness
entails
self-consciousness
.


Furthermore
,
according
to
Aristotle
,
since
the
intellect
takes
on
the
form
of
that
which
is
thought
(Kahn
1992)
,
it
“is
thinkable
just
as
the
thought-objects
are”
(De
Anima
3
.

4
.

430)
,
an
assertion
that
was
interpreted
by
Aristotle’s
medieval
commentators
as
the
view
that
self-awareness
depends
on
an
awareness
of
extra-mental
things
(Cory
2014
:
ch
.


1
;
Owens
1988)
.



By
contrast
,
the
Platonic
tradition
,
principally
through
the
influence
of
Augustine
,
writing
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
centuries
,
is
associated
with
the
view
that
the
mind
“gains
the
knowledge
of
[itself]
through
itself”
(On
the
Trinity
9
.

3
;
Matthews
1992
;
Cary
2000)
by
being
present
to
itself
.


Thus
,
on
this
view
,
self-awareness
requires
no
awareness
of
outer
things
.


In
a
similar
vein
,
in
the
eleventh
century
,
Avicenna
argues
,
by
way
of
his
Flying
Man
thought
experiment
,
that
a
newly
created
person
floating
in
a
void
,
with
all
senses
disabled
,
would
nevertheless
be
self-aware
.


Thus
the
self
that
one
cognises
cannot
be
a
bodily
thing
of
which
one
is
aware
through
the
senses
(Kaukua
&
Kukkonen
2007
;
Black
2008
;
Kaukua
2015)
.


On
such
views
,
and
in
contrast
to
the
Aristotelian
picture
,
basic
self-awareness
is
neither
sensory
in
nature
nor
dependent
on
the
awareness
of
other
things
.


This
latter
claim
was
accepted
by
Aquinas
,
writing
in
the
thirteenth
century
,
who
can
be
seen
as
synthesising
aspects
of
the
Platonic
and
Aristotelian
traditions
(Cory
2014)
.


For
not
only
does
Aquinas
claim
that
there
is
a
form
of
self-awareness—awareness
that
one
exists—for
which
,
“the
mere
presence
of
the
mind
suffices”
,
there
is
another
form—awareness
of
one’s
essence—that
,
as
Aristotle
had
claimed
,
is
dependent
on
cognising
other
things
and
so
for
which
“the
mere
presence
of
the
mind
does
not
suffice”
(Summa
1
,
87
,
1
;
Kenny
1993
:
ch
.


10)
.



This
ancient
and
medieval
debate
concerning
whether
the
mere
presence
of
the
mind
is
sufficient
for
self-awareness
is
related
to
another
concerning
whether
self-awareness
is
itself
sensory
in
character
or
,
put
another
way
,
whether
the
self
is
or
is
not
perceptible
.


Aquinas
has
sometimes
been
interpreted
as
offering
a
positive
answer
to
this
question
,
sometimes
a
negative
answer
(see

:
ch
.

,
and
Cory

,
for
differing
views)
.


These
issues
were
also
discussed
in
various
Indian
(Hindu
,
Jain
,
and
Buddhist)
debates
(Albahari
2006
;
Siderits
,
Thompson
,
&
Zahavi
2013
;
Ganeri
2012a
,b)
,
with
a
variety
of
perspectives
represented
.


For
example
,
in
the
writing
of
the
eleventh
century
Jain
writer
Prabhācandra
,
there
appears
an
argument
very
much
like
Avicenna’s
Flying
Man
argument
for
the
possibility
of
self-awareness
without
awareness
of
the
body
(Ganeri
2012a
:
ch
.

,
whereas
various
thinkers
of
the
Advaita
Vendānta
school
argue
that
there
is
no
self-awareness
without
embodiment
(Ram-Prasad
2013)
.


There
were
,
therefore
,
wide-ranging
debates
in
the
ancient
and
medieval
period
not
only
about
the
nature
of
self-consciousness
,
but
also
about
its
relation
to
other
aspects
of
the
mind
,
most
notably
sensory
perception
and
awareness
of
the
body
.

Early
Modern
Discussions
of
Self-Consciousness

Central
to
the
early
modern
discussion
of
self-consciousness
are
Descartes’
assertions
,
in
the
second
of
his
Meditations
,
that
“I
am
,
I
exist
,
is
necessarily
true
whenever
it
is
put
forward
by
me
or
conceived
in
my
mind”
(Descartes
1641
:
80)
,
and
,
in
both
his
Discourse
and
Principles
,
that
“I
think
,
therefore
I
am”
,
or
“cogito
ergo
sum”
(Descartes
1637
:
36
,
and
Descartes
1644
:
162
;
see
the
discussion
of
Reflection
in
the
entry
on
seventeenth
century
theories
of
consciousness)
.


The
cogito
,
which
was
anticipated
by
Augustine
(On
the
Trinity
10
.

10
;
Pasnau
2002
:
ch
.


11)
,
embodies
two
elements
of
self-awareness—awareness
that
one
is
thinking
and
awareness
that
one
exists—that
play
a
foundational
role
in
Descartes’
epistemological
project
.


As
such
,
it
is
crucial
for
Descartes
that
the
cogito
is
something
of
which
we
can
be
absolutely
certain
.


But
whilst
most
commentators
are
happy
to
agree
that
both
“I
am
thinking”
and
“I
exist”
are
indubitable
,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
debate
over
the
grounds
for
such
certainty
and
over
the
form
of
the
cogito
itself
(Hintikka
1962
;

1978

,

;

.


Williams
1978

;
Markie

.


Of
particular
concern
is
the
question
whether
these
two
propositions
are
known
by
inference
or
non-inferentially
,
e
.

g
.


,
by
intuition
,
an
issue
that
echoes
the
medieval
debates
concerning
whether
one
can
be
said
to
perceive
oneself
.



One
philosopher
who
accepts
the
former
,
intuition-based
,
account
is
Locke
,
who
claims
that


we
have
an
intuitive
Knowledge
of
our
own
Existence
,
and
an
internal

infallible
Perception
that
we
are
.


In
every
Act
of
Sensation
,

Reasoning
,
or
Thinking
,
we
are
conscious
to
ourselves
of
our
own

Being
.


(1700
:
IV
.

ix
.

A
similar
claim
can
be
found
in
Berkeley’s
Three
Dialogues
(1713
:
231–234
;
Stoneham
2002
:
§6
.

4)
.


Further
,
Locke
makes
self-consciousness
partly
definitive
of
the
very
concept
of
a
person
,
a
person
being
“a
thinking
intelligent
Being
,
that
has
reason
and
reflection
,
and
can
consider
it
self
as
it
self
,
the
same
thinking
thing
in
different
times
and
places”

,
and
self-consciousness
also
plays
an
important
role
in
his
theory
of
personal
identity
(see
§4

.



If
Descartes
,
Locke
,
and
Berkeley
can
be
interpreted
as
accepting
the
view
that
there
is
an
inner
perception
of
the
self
,
on
this
question
Hume
stands
in
stark
contrast
notoriously
writing
that
whilst


there
are
some
philosophers
,
who
imagine
we
are
every
moment

intimately
conscious
of
what
we
call
our
self
[…]
For
my
part
when
I

enter
most
intimately
into
what
I
call
myself
,
I
always
stumble
on

some
particular
perception
or
other
,
of
heat
or
cold
,
light
or
shade
,

love
or
hatred
,
pain
or
pleasure
.


I
never
can
catch
myself
at
any
time

without
a
perception
,
and
never
can
observe
anything
but
the

perception
.

Hume’s
view
that
there
is
no
impression
,
or
perception
,
of
oneself
is
crucial
to
his
case
for
the
understanding
of
our
idea
of
ourselves
as
nothing
more
than
a
“heap
or
collection
of
different
perceptions”
(1739–40

,
since
lacking
an
impression
of
the
owner
of
these
perceptions
we
must
,
in
accordance
with
his
empiricist
account
of
concept
acquisition
,
lack
an
idea
of
such
.


It
is
clear
,
then
,
that
in
the
early
modern
period
issues
of
self-consciousness
play
an
important
role
in
a
variety
of
philosophical
questions
regarding
persons
and
their
minds
.

Kantian
and
Post-Kantian
Discussions
of
Self-Consciousness

Hume’s
denial
that
there
is
an
inner
perception
of
the
self
as
the
owner
of
experience
is
one
that
is
echoed
in
Kant’s
discussion
in
both
the
Transcendental
Deduction
and
the
Paralogisms
,
where
he
writes
that
there
is
no
intuition
of
the
self
“through
which
it
is
given
as
object”
(Kant
1781/1787
:
B408
;
Brook
1994
;
Ameriks
1982
[2000])
.


Kant’s
account
of
self-consciousness
and
its
significance
is
complex
,
a
central
element
of
the
Transcendental
Deduction
being
the
claim
that
a
form
of
self-awareness—transcendental
apperception—is
required
to
account
for
the
unity
of
conscious
experience
over
time
.


In
Kant’s
words
,
“the
‘I
think’
must
be
able
to
accompany
all
my
representations”
(Kant
1781/1787
:
B132
;
Keller
1998
;
Kitcher
2011
;
see
the
entry
on
Kant’s
view
of
the
mind
and
consciousness
of
self)
.


Thus
,
while
Kant
denies
that
there
is
an
inner
awareness
of
the
self
as
an
object
that
owns
its
experiences
,
we
must
nevertheless
be
aware
of
those
experiences
as
things
that
are
,
both
individually
and
collectively
,
our
own
.


The
representation
of
the
self
in
this
“I
think”
is
then
,
according
to
Kant
,
purely
formal
,
exhausted
by
its
function
in
unifying
experience
.



The
Kantian
account
of
self-awareness
and
its
relation
to
the
capacity
for
objective
thought
set
the
agenda
for
a
great
deal
of
post-Kantian
philosophy
.


On
the
nature
of
self-awareness
,
for
example
,
in
an
unpublished
manuscript
Schopenhauer
concurs
with
Kant
,
asserting
that
,
“that
the
subject
should
become
an
object
for
itself
is
the
most
monstrous
contradiction
ever
thought
of”
(quoted
in
Janaway
1989
:
120)
.


Further
,
a
philosophical
tradition
stemming
from
Kant’s
work
has
tried
to
identify
the
necessary
conditions
of
the
possibility
of
self-consciousness
,
with
P
.

F
.


Strawson
(1959
,
1966)
,
Evans
(1980
,
1982)
,
and
Cassam
(1997)
,
for
example
,
exploring
the
relation
between
the
capacity
for
self-conscious
thought
and
the
possession
of
a
conception
of
oneself
as
an
embodied
agent
located
within
an
objective
world
(see
§4
.

3)
.


Another
,
related
tradition
has
argued
that
an
awareness
of
subjects
other
than
oneself
is
a
necessary
condition
of
self-consciousness
(see
§4
.

4)
.


Historical
variations
on
such
a
view
can
be
found
in
Fichte
(1794–1795
;
Wood
2006)
,
Hegel
(1807
;
Pippin
2010)
,
and
,
from
a
somewhat
different
perspective
,
Mead
(1934
;
Aboulafia
1986)
.



Fichte
offers
the
most
influential
account
of
self-consciousness
in
the
post-Kantian
tradition
.


On
the
reading
of
the
“Heidelberg
School”
,
Fichte
claims
that
previous
accounts
of
self-consciousness
given
by
Descartes
,
Locke
,
and
even
Kant
are
“reflective”
,
regarding
the
self
as
taking
itself
not
as
subject
but
as
object
(Henrich
1967
;
Tugendhat
1979
:
ch
.


3
;
Frank
2004
;
Zahavi
2007)
.


But
this
reflective
form
of
self-awareness
,
Fichte
argues
,
presupposes
a
more
primitive
form
since
it
is
necessary
for
the
reflecting
self
to
be
aware
that
the
reflected
self
is
in
fact
itself
.


Consequently
,
according
to
Fichte
,
we
must
possess
an
immediate
acquaintance
with
ourselves
,
“the
self
exists
and
posits
its
own
existence
by
virtue
of
merely
existing”
(Fichte
1794–1795
:
97)
.


Once
more
,
this
debate
echoes
ancient
discussions
concerning
the
nature
and
role
of
self-consciousness
.

Early
Twentieth
Century
Discussions
of
Self-Consciousness

In
the
early
twentieth
century
,
Frege
suggests
a
form
of
self-acquaintance
,
claiming
that
“everyone
is
presented
to
himself
in
a
special
and
primitive
way”
(Frege
1918–1919
:
333)
.


In
a
similar
vein
,
in
early
work
Russell
(1910)
favours
the
idea
that
we
are
acquainted
with
ourselves
,
but
by
the
1920s
(1921
:
141)
he
seems
to
endorse
a
view
more
in
line
with
Hume’s
sceptical
account
.


The
same
can
be
said
of
the
Wittgenstein
of
the
Tractatus
,
who
famously
likens
the
self
to
the
eye
which
sees
but
does
not
see
itself
(Wittgenstein
1921
:
5
.

6–5
.

641
;
O’Brien
1996
;
Sullivan
1996)
.


Husserl’s
philosophical
development
seems
to
have
taken
the
opposite
trajectory
to
that
of
Russell
,
with
his
(1900/1901
,
Investigation
V
,
§8)
denial
of
the
inner
awareness
of
a
“pure
ego”
being
subsequently
revised
into
something
resembling
Kantian
transcendental
apperception
(Husserl
1913
:
§57
;
Carr
1999
:
ch
.


3
;
Zahavi
2005
:
ch
.


2)
.


Continuing
with
the
phenomenological
tradition
,
Sartre
(1937
;
Priest
2000)
takes
Husserl’s
later
view
to
task
,
arguing
against
the
view
that
we
are
continually
aware
of
a
transcendental
ego
,
yet
in
favour
of
the
picture
of
consciousness
as
involving
a
“pre-reflective”
awareness
of
itself
reminiscent
of
the
Heidelberg
School
view
(Wider
1997
:
ch
.

;
Miguens
,
Preyer
,
&
Morando
2016)
.


Questions
about
the
nature
of
self-consciousness
and
,
in
particular
,
over
whether
there
is
an
immediate
,
or
intuitive
,
consciousness
of
the
self
,
were
as
lively
as
ever
well
into
the
twentieth
century
.

Self-Consciousness
in
Thought

One
natural
way
to
think
of
self-consciousness
is
in
terms
of
a
subject’s
capacity
to
entertain
conscious
thought
about
herself
.


Self-conscious
thoughts
are
thoughts
about
oneself
.


But
it
is
commonly
pointed
out
that
thinking
about
what
merely
happens
to
be
oneself
is
insufficient
for
self-consciousness
,
rather
one
must
think
of
oneself
as
oneself
.


If
one
is
capable
of
self-conscious
thought
,
that
is
,
one
must
be
able
to
think
in
such
a
way
that
it
is
manifest
to
one
that
it
is
oneself
about
whom
one
is
thinking
.



It
is
widely
recognised
that
the
paradigmatic
linguistic
expression
of
self-consciousness
in
English
is
the
first-person
pronoun
“I”
;
a
term
with
which
one
might
be
said
to
refer
to
oneself
as
oneself
(Sainsbury
2011)
.


Plausibly
,
every
utterance
of
a
sentence
containing
“I”
is
expressive
of
a
self-conscious
“I-thought”
,
that
is
a
thought
containing
the
first-person
concept
.


Thus
,
discussions
of
self-consciousness
are
often
closely
associated
with
accounts
of
the
semantics
of
the
indexical
term
“I”
and
the
nature
of
its
counterpart
first-person
concept
(e

.



As
Castañeda
(1966
;
cf
.


Anscombe
1975)
points
out
,
there
is
an
ambiguity
in
certain
ascriptions
of
belief
containing
“he”
,
“she”
,
or
“they”
.


I
may
say
“Jane
believes
that
she
is
F”
without
implying
that
Jane
realises
that
it
is
herself
that
she
believes
to
be
F
.


That
is
,
there
is
a
reading
of
“Jane
believes
that
she
is
F”
that
does
not
imply
self-consciousness
on
Jane’s
part
.


But
,
in
some
cases
,
we
do
intend
to
attribute
self-consciousness
with
that
same
form
of
words
.


To
resolve
this
ambiguity
,
Castañeda
introduces
“she*”
for
self-conscious
attributions
.


I
will
use
the
more
natural
indirect
reflexive
“she
herself”
.


Thus
,
“Jane
believes
that
she
is
F”
does
not
imply
that
Jane
self-consciously
believes
that
she
is
F
,
whilst
“Jane
believes
that
she
herself
is
F”
does
.


Before
the
dreadful
revelation
,
Oedipus
believed
that
he
was
prophesied
to
kill
his
father
,
but
did
not
believe
that
he
himself
was
so
prophesied
.

The
Essential
Indexical

First-personal
language
and
thought
is
commonly
taken
to
be
sui
generis
,
irreducible
to
language
or
thought
not
containing
the
first-person
pronoun
or
corresponding
concept
(Castañeda
1966
,
1967
;
Perry
1977
,
1979
,
2001)
.


Arguments
for
this
view
have
typically
appealed
to
the
essential
role
seemingly
played
by
the
first-person
in
explanations
of
action
(see
the
entry
on
self-locating
beliefs)
.


This
point
is
supported
by
a
number
of
well-known
examples
.


Consider
Perry’s
case
of
the
messy
shopper
,


I
once
followed
a
trail
of
sugar
on
a
supermarket
floor
,
pushing
my

cart
down
the
aisle
on
one
side
of
a
tall
counter
and
back
the
aisle

on
the
other
,
seeking
the
shopper
with
the
torn
sack
to
tell
him
he

was
making
a
mess
.


With
each
trip
around
the
counter
,
the
trail
became

thicker
.


But
I
seemed
unable
to
catch
up
.


Finally
it
dawned
on
me
.


I

was
the
shopper
I
was
trying
to
catch
.


(Perry
1979
:
33)

As
Perry
points
out
,
he
knew
all
along
that
the
shopper
with
the
torn
sack
was
making
a
mess
.


He
may
also
have
believed
that
the
oldest
philosopher
in
the
shop
(in
fact
himself)
was
making
a
mess
,
yet
failed
to
check
his
own
cart
since
he
falsely
believed
that
Quine
was
at
the
Deli
Counter
.


Indeed
,
it
seems
that
for
any
non-indexical
term
a
that
denotes
Perry
,
it
is
possible
for
Perry
to
fail
to
believe
anything
naturally
expressed
by
the
sentence
“I
am
a”
.


If
so
,
it
is
possible
for
Perry
to
rationally
believe
that
a
is
making
a
mess
without
believing
anything
that
he
would
express
as
“I
am
making
a
mess”
.


It
was
only
when
Perry
came
to
believe
that
he
himself
was
making
a
mess
that
he
stopped
the
chase
.


Indeed
,
it
would
seem
that
only
the
first-personal
content
can
provide
an
adequate
explanation
of
Perry’s
behaviour
when
he
stops
.


If
Perry
had
come
to
believe
that
John
Perry
is
making
a
mess
then
,
unless
he
also
believed
that
he
himself
was
John
Perry
,
he
would
not
have
stopped
.


The
first-personal
content
is
“self-locating”
,
thereby
enabling
action
,
whereas
the
non-first-personal
content
is
not
.


To
use
Kaplan’s
(1977)
example
,
if
I
believe
that
my
pants
are
on
fire
,
pure
self-interest
will
surely
motivate
me
do
something
about
it
.


If
,
however
,
I
believe
that
Smith’s
pants
are
on
fire
,
pure
self-interest
will
only
so
motivate
me
if
I
also
believe
that
I
am
Smith
.



On
this
widely
accepted
picture
,
then
,
first-personal
thought
and
language
is
irreducible
to
non-first-personal
thought
and
language
,
and
is
essential
to
the
explanation
of
action
(Kaplan

.


Importantly
,
on
Perry’s
view
,
what
is
irreducible
is
the
first-personal
way
of
thinking
about
ourselves
,
not
the
facts
or
states
of
affairs
that
make
such
thoughts
true
.


So
,
whilst
my
belief
“I
am
F”
is
not
equivalent
to
any
non-first-personal
belief
,
it
is
true
if
and
only
if
Smith
is
F
,
this
being
the
same
fact
that
makes
true
the
non-first-personal
“Smith
is
F”
.


Thus
,
whilst
first-person
representations
are
special
,
a
special
class
of
first-person
facts
are
nowhere
to
be
found
(for
views
that
do
accept
the
existence
of
first-personal
facts
,
see
McGinn
1983
;
Baker
2013
;
Builes
2024
;
also
see
Nagel
1986)
.



Perry
(1977
,
1979)
argues
that
terms
such
as
“I”
which
are
,
as
he
puts
it
,
“essentially
indexical”
,
pose
a
problem
for
the
traditional
Fregean
view
of
belief
as
a
two-place
relation
between
a
subject
and
a
proposition
(cf
.


Spencer
2007)
.


Fregean
senses
are
,
according
to
Perry
,
descriptive
and
as
Perry
has
argued
no
description
is
equivalent
to
an
essential
indexical
.


Consequently
,
no
Fregean
proposition
can
be
the
thing
believed
when
one
believes
first-personally
.


Essential
indexicality
,
if
somehow
forced
into
the
Fregean
mould
,
means
that
we
must
implausibly
accept
that
there
are
incommunicable
senses
that
only
the
speaker
(or
thinker)
is
in
a
position
to
grasp
(see
García-Carpintero
&
Torre
2016)
;
cf
.

Evans
1981
;
Longworth

.


Lewis
goes
further
than
this
,
arguing
,
partly
on
the
basis
of
his
much
discussed
Two
Gods
example
(1979)
,
in
which
each
God
knows
all
the
propositions
true
at
their
world
yet
fails
to
know
which
of
the
two
Gods
he
himself
is
,
that
the
objects
of
belief
are
not
propositions
at
all
but
rather
properties
(or
centred
worlds)
.


That
is
,
since
they
already
know
all
the
true
propositions
,
there
is
no
true
proposition
the
Gods
would
come
to
believe
when
they
come
to
realise
which
God
they
are
.


Essential
indexicality
forces
us
away
from
the
model
of
propositions
as
the
objects
of
belief
.


Further
,
Lewis
claims
that
not
just
the
explicitly
indexical
cases
,
but
all
belief
is
in
this
way
self-locating
or
,
in
his
terminology
,
de
se
.


On
this
account
,
every
belief
involves
the
self-ascription
of
a
property
and
so
,
arguably
,
is
an
instance
of
self-consciousness
(for

Arguments
such
as
Perry’s
might
be
challenged
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
not
possible
to
rationally
doubt
that
one
is
the
subject
of
these
conscious
states
,
where
that
formulation
involves
an
“introspective
demonstrative”
picking
out
one’s
current
conscious
states
.


This
,
it
might
be
claimed
,
constitutes
a
reduction
of
first-person
content
(cf
.


Peacocke
1983
:
ch
.


5
,
although
his
goal
is
not
reductive)
.


Even
if
it
is
true
,
however
,
that
one
cannot
doubt
that
one
is
the
subject
of
these
conscious
states
,
it
is
not
clear
that
this
poses
a
significant
challenge
to
Perry’s
argument
for
the
essential
indexicality
of
the
first-person
.


For
one
thing
,
the
content
itself
contains
a
demonstrative
,
so
indexical
,
element
.


Second
,
it
has
been
argued
that
our
capacity
to
refer
to
our
own
experiences
itself
depends
on
our
capacity
to
refer
to
ourselves
as
ourselves
(P

F
.


Strawson

;
Evans

.


That
is
,
to
think
of
these
conscious
states
is
to
think
of
them
as
these
conscious
states
of
mine
.


If
to
demonstratively
think
of
one’s
conscious
state
is
,
necessarily
,
to
think
of
it
as
one’s
own
conscious
state
,
then
the
purported
reduction
of
first-person
thought
to
thought
not
containing
the
first-person
will
fail
.



Cappelen
and
Dever
(2013)
present
a
sustained
attack
on
the
constellation
of
philosophical
claims
surrounding
the
“essential
indexical”
,
including
its
purported
relation
to
action
,
and
both
Perry’s
and
Lewis’s
arguments
for
it
(for
alternative
objections
to
Perry
and
Lewis
,
see
Millikan
1990
;
Magidor
2015)
.


A
central
element
in
their
critique
is
the
claim
that
cases
,
such
as
Perry’s
shopper
,
that
are
often
thought
to
show
the
special
connection
between
self-consciousness
(I-thoughts)
and
the
capacity
for
action
really
only
show
that
action
explanation
contexts
do
not
allow
for
substitution
salva
veritate
,
but
rather
are
opaque

Dever

Just
as
,
if
I
am
at
the
airport
waiting
for
Jones
,
I
will
only
signal
that
man
if
I
believe
him
to
be
Jones
,
so
if
I
am
looking
for
the
shopper
with
the
torn
sack
I
will
only
stop
when
I
believe
that
I
am
that
shopper
.


On
their
view
,
despite
the
popularity
of
the
view
to
the
contrary
,
the
capacity
for
self-consciousness
does
not
possess
any
philosophically
deep
relation
to
the
capacity
for
action

First-Person
Reference

Because
of
its
connection
with
the
first-person
pronoun
,
it
is
often
taken
as
platitudinous
to
say
that
self-conscious
thought
is
closely
associated
with
the
capacity
to
refer
to
oneself
as
oneself
.


When
I
think
self-consciously
,
I
cannot
fail
to
refer
to
myself
.


More
than
this
,
it
has
often
been
claimed
that
for
a
central
class
of
first-person
thoughts
,
there
is
no
possibility
of
misidentifying
myself
:
not
only
can
I
not
fail
to
pick
myself
out
,
I
cannot
take
another
person
to
be
me
.


But
first-person
reference
,
and
indexicality
more
generally
,
has
sometimes
been
thought
to
pose
a
challenge
to
theories
of
reference
,
requiring
special
treatment
.


Indeed
,
some
have
argued
that
the
platitude
itself
should
be
rejected
.



Terms
whose
function
it
is
to
refer
can
,
on
occasion
,
fail
in
that
function
.


A
use
of
the
term
“Vulcan”
to
refer
to
the
planet
orbiting
between
Mercury
and
the
sun
,
fails
to
refer
to
anything
for
the
reason
that
there
is
nothing
for
it
to
refer
to
.


If
I
see
the
head
of
one
dachshund
protruding
from
behind
a
tree
and
the
rear
end
of
another
protruding
from
the
other
side
of
the
tree
,
and
utter
“that
dog
is
huge”
,
my
use
of
“that
dog”
has
arguably
failed
to
refer
due
to
there
being
too
many
objects
.


It
would
seem
that
,
by
contrast
,
the
term
“I”
cannot
fail
to
refer
either
by
there
being
too
few
or
too
many
objects
.


“I”
is
guaranteed
to
refer
.



As
an
indexical
,
the
referent
of
“I”
varies
with
the
context
of
utterance
(see
the
entry
on
indexicals)
.


That
is
,
“I”
refers
to
different
people
depending
on
who
utters
it
.


Following
Kaplan
(1977)
,
it
is
common
to
think
of
the
meaning
of
such
terms
as
determining
a
function
from
context
to
referent
.


In
the
case
of
“I”
,
a
natural
proposal
is
the
“Self-Reference
Rule”
(SRR)
,
that
the
referent
of
a
token
of
“I”
is
the
person
that
produces
it
(Kaplan
1977
:
491
;
Campbell
1994
:
ch
.


3)
.


“I”
is
thus
,
unlike
“this”
or
“that”
,
a
pure
indexical
,
seemingly
requiring
no
overt
demonstration
or
manifestation
of
intention
(Kaplan
1977
:
489–91)
.


SRR
captures
the
plausible
thought
that
“I”
is
guaranteed
against
reference
failure
.


Since
every
token
of
“I”
has
been
produced
,
the
fact
that
“I”
refers
to
its
producer
means
that
there
is
no
chance
of
its
failing
to
pick
out
some
entity
.


This
account
of
“I”
,
then
,
treats
it
as
not
only
expressive
of
self-consciousness
,
but
also
guaranteed
to
refer
to
the
utterer
.



SRR
is
Kaplan’s
specification
of
the
character
of
“I”
,
which
is
fixed
independently
of
the
context
of
any
particular
utterance
.


This
character
is
to
be
distinguished
from
the
content
of
a
tokening
of
“I”
,
which
it
has
only
in
a
context
.


On
Kaplan’s
account
,
the
content
of
an
utterance
of
“I
am
F”
will
be
a
singular
proposition
composed
of
the
person
that
produced
it
and
Fness
(Recanati
1993
;
for
an
account
that
attributes
to
the
utterance
both
singular
content
,
and
the
“reflexive
content”
the
speaker
of
this
token
is
F
,
see
Perry
2001
;
for
an
alternative
“Neo-Fregean”
account
in
terms
of
object-dependent
de
re
senses

see
Evans
1981
;
cf
.


McDowell
1977
;
and
Evans

.

.



Intuitively
plausible
as
it
is
,
SRR
is
open
to
a
number
of
potential
counterexamples
.


Suppose
,
for
example
,
that
you
are
away
from
work
due
to
illness
and
I
leave
a
note
on
your
door
reading
“I
am
not
here
now”
.


Plausibly
,
whilst
it
was
me
that
produced
this
token
of
“I”
,
it
nevertheless
refers
to
you
.


Or
consider
a
situation
in
which
I
walk
into
a
petrol
station
,
point
to
my
car
,
and
say
“I’m
empty”
.


In
this
case
,
it
might
be
suggested
,
my
use
of
“I”
refers
to
my
car
rather
than
myself
(for
these
and
related
cases

Vision
1985
;
Q
.


Smith
1989
;
Sidelle
1991
;
Nunberg
1993
,
1995)
.


If
so
,
SRR
cannot
specify
the
character
of
“I”
and
so
,
arguably
,
some
tokens
of
“I”
fail
to
express
the
self-conscious
thoughts
of
those
that
produce
them
.


In
light
of
such
cases
,
a
variety
of
alternatives
to
SRR
have
been
proposed
.


Q
.


Smith
(1989)
suggests
that
“I”
is
lexically
ambiguous
;
Predelli
(1998a
,b
,
2002)
offers
an
intention-based
reference
rule
for
“I”
;
Corazza
,
Fish
,
and
Gorvett
(2002)
offer
a
convention-based
account
;
and
Cohen
(2013)
argues
that
the
cases
can
be
handled
by
a
conservative
modification
of
Kaplan’s
original
proposal
(also
see
,
Romdenh-Romluc
2002
,
2008
;
Corazza

:
ch
.

;
Dodd
&
Sweeney
2010
;
Michaelson
2014
;
Åkerman

.



Although
she
didn’t
have
Kaplan’s
formulation
of
SRR
in
mind
,
an
earlier
criticism
of
such
a
rule
can
be
found
in
the
work
of
Anscombe
(1975)
who
argues
that
the
rule
cannot
be
complete
as
an
account
of
the
meaning
of
“I”
(for
discussion
see
O’Brien
1994)
.


Anscombe
considers
a
world
in
which
each
person
has
two
names
,
one
of
which
(ranging
from
“B”
to
“Z”)
is
printed
on
their
chest
,
the
other
(in
every
case
“A”)
is
printed
on
the
inside
of
their
wrist
.


Each
person
uses
“B”
to
“Z”
when
attributing
actions
to
others
,
but
“A”
when
describing
their
own
actions
(Anscombe
1975
:
49)
.


Anscombe
argues
that
such
a
situation
is
compatible
with
the
possibility
that
the
people
in
question
lack
self-consciousness
.


Whilst
B
uses
“A”
to
refer
to
B
,
C
uses
“A”
to
refer
to
C
,
and
so
on
,
there
is
no
guarantee
that
they
are
thinking
of
themselves
as
themselves
,
for
they
may
be
reporting
what
are
in
fact
their
own
actions
without
thinking
of
those
actions
as
things
that
they
themselves
are
performing
.


They
may
treat
themselves
,
that
is
,
just
as
the
treat
any
other
.


This
is
despite
the
fact
that
,
in
this
scenario
,
“A”
complies
with
SRR
.



Can
the
Self-Reference
Rule
be
reformulated
in
such
a
way
as
to
entail
self-consciousness
on
the
part
of
those
who
use
terms
that
comply
with
it
?


According
to
Anscombe
it
can
,
but
any
such
reformulation
will
presuppose
a
prior
grasp
of
self-conscious
reference
to
oneself
.


For
example
,
if
we
say
,
employing
the
indirect
reflexive
,
that
“I”
is
a
term
that
a
person
uses
to
refer
to
she
herself
,
we
have
travelled
in
a
tight
circle
since
“she
herself”
can
be
understood
only
in
terms
of
“I”
(Anscombe
1975
;
Castañeda
1966
;
for
discussion
,
see
Bermúdez
1998
:
ch
.


1
;
Haddock
2019
;
Teichmann
2022
,
Part
IV)
.


This
can
be
seen
clearly
in
the
first-person
formulation
of
such
a
rule
:
“I”
is
a
term
that
I
use
to
refer
to
myself
.


For
here
the
“myself”
must
itself
be
understood
as
an
expression
of
self-consciousness
,
i
.

e
.


,
we
should
really
say
that
“I”
is
a
term
that
I
use
to
refer
to
myself
as
myself
.



In
response
to
Anscombe’s
argument
,
it
has
been
argued
that
SRR
is
not
intended
to
explain
the
connection
between
self-consciousness
and
the
first-person
(O’Brien
1994
,

On
this
view
,
all
that
the
example
of
“A”
users
shows
is
that
self-consciousness
has
not
been
fully
accounted
for
by
SRR
,
not
that
SRR
fails
as
an
account
of
the
character
of
“I”
.


Kaplan
himself
,
however
,
does
appear
to
be
more
ambitious
than
this
,
claiming
that
the
“particular
and
primitive
way”
in
which
each
of
us
is
presented
to
ourselves
is
simply
that
each
“is
presented
to
himself
under
the
character
of
‘I’”
(Kaplan
1977
:
533)
.


This
claim
,
it
would
seem
,
is
indeed
open
to
Anscombe’s
challenge
.



Anscombe’s
(1975)
paper
is
perhaps
most
notable
for
her
claim
that
“I”
is
not
a
referring
expression
at
all
.


Assuming
that
if
“I”
refers
it
must
be
understood
on
the
model
of
either
a
proper
name
,
a
demonstrative
,
or
an
abbreviation
of
a
definite
description
,
Anscombe
argues
that
each
of
these
kinds
of
referring
expression
requires
what
she
calls
a
“conception”
by
means
of
which
it
reaches
its
referent
.


This
conception
must
explain
the
seemingly
guaranteed
reference
of
“I”
:
the
apparent
fact
that
no
token
of
“I”
can
fail
to
pick
out
an
object
.


However
,
she
argues
,
no
satisfactory
conception
can
be
specified
for
“I”
since
either
it
fails
to
deliver
up
guaranteed
reference
,
or
it
succeeds
but
only
by
delivering
an
immaterial
soul
.


Since
we
have
independent
reason
to
believe
that
there
are
no
immaterial
souls
,
it
follows
that
“I”
cannot
be
understood
on
the
model
of
a
proper
name
,
demonstrative
or
definite
description
,
so
is
not
a
referring
expression
(for
positive
appraisals
of
Anscombe’s
position
see
Kenny
1979
;
Malcolm
1979
;
Haddock
2019
and
2022
.


Criticisms
can
be
found
in
White
1979
;
Hamilton
1991
;
Brandom

;
Glock
&
Hacker
1996
;
McDowell

;
Harcourt

;

.



That
“I”
does
not
function
as
either
a
name
or
an
abbreviated
definite
description
is
widely
accepted
.


The
more
contentious
aspect
of
Anscombe’s
case
for
the
view
that
there
is
no
appropriate
conception
for
“I”
is
her
claim
that
“I”
does
not
function
like
a
demonstrative
.


Her
argument
for
this
claim
is
highly
reminiscent
of
Avicenna’s
Flying
Man
argument
(see
§1
.

1)
,
with
which
she
was
surely
familiar
.


We
can
,
she
tells
us
,
imagine
a
subject
in
a
sensory
deprivation
tank
who
has
been
anaesthetised
and
is
suffering
from
amnesia
.


Such
a
subject
would
,
claims
Anscombe
,
be
able
to
think
I-thoughts
,
perhaps
wondering
,
“How
did
I
get
into
this
mess
?

”
.


Since
such
a
subject
can
think
self-consciously
in
the
absence
of
any
presented
referent
,
it
follows
that
“I”
cannot
mean
something
like
“this
person”
,
since
demonstratives
require
the
demonstrated
object
to
be
presented
to
conscious
awareness
.


Treating
“I”
on
a
demonstrative
model
,
then
,
fails
(cf
.


Campbell
1994
:
§4
.

2
;
O’Brien
1995b
;
see
Morgan
2015
for
a
defence
of
a
demonstrative
account)
.



According
to
Evans
(1982
:
ch
.


7)
,
the
problem
with
Anscombe’s
argument
is
that
it
fails
to
appreciate
that
“I”
can
be
modelled
on
“here”
rather
than
“this”
.


According
to
Evans’
account
,
the
similarity
between
what
he
calls
“I”-Ideas
and
“here”-Ideas
shows
up
in
their
functional
role
(for
an
alternative
broadly
functional
account
,
see
Mellor
1989
;
for
an
argument
that
,
far
from
being
amenable
to
a
functional
analysis
,
self-consciousness
poses
a
threat
to
the
coherence
of
functionalism
,
see
Bealer
1997)
.


Once
we
see
how
both
“I”-Ideas
and
“here”-Ideas
stand
at
the
centre
of
distinctive
networks
of
inputs
(ways
of
gaining
information
about
ourselves
and
our
locations
respectively)
and
outputs
(including
the
explanation
of
action)
,
we
can
see
how
to
model
“I”
on
“here”
,
thus
escaping
Anscombe’s
argument
.

Immunity
to
Error
Through
Misidentification

In
The
Blue
and
Brown
Books
,
Wittgenstein
distinguishes
between
two
uses
of
the
term
“I”
which
he
calls
the
“use
as
subject”
and
the
“use
as
object”
(1958
:
66–70
;
Garrett
1998
:
ch
.


8
;
cf
.


James’
distinction
between
the
I
,
or
pure
ego
,
and
the
me
,
or
empirical
self
(1890
:
vol
.


1
,
ch
.


X))
.


As
Wittgenstein
describes
the
difference
,
there
is
a
certain
kind
of
error
in
thought
that
is
possible
when
“I”
is
used
as
object
but
not
when
“I”
is
used
as
subject
.


Wittgenstein
notes
that
if
I
find
myself
in
a
tangle
of
bodies
,
I
may
wrongly
take
another’s
visibly
broken
arm
to
be
my
own
,
mistakenly
judging
“I
have
a
broken
arm”
.


Upon
seeing
a
broken
arm
,
then
,
it
can
make
sense
to
wonder
whether
or
not
it
is
mine
.


If
,
however
,
I
feel
a
pain
in
the
arm
,
and
on
that
basis
judge
“I
have
a
pain”
,
then
it
makes
no
sense
at
all
for
me
to
wonder
whether
the
pain
of
which
I
am
aware
is
mine
.


That
is
,
it
is
not
possible
for
me
to
be
aware
,
in
the
ordinary
way
,
of
a
pain
in
an
arm
but
mistakenly
judge
it
to
be
my
own
arm
that
hurts
.


On
this
picture
,
self-ascriptions
of
pain
,
at
least
when
based
on
the
usual
introspective
grounds
,
involve
the
use
of
“I”
as
subject
and
so
are
immune
to
this
sort
of
error
of
misidentification
.



Immunity
to
this
sort
of
error
should
not
be
conflated
with
another
sort
of
epistemic
security
that
is
often
discussed
under
the
heading
of
self-knowledge
(see
entry
on
self-knowledge)
.


Some
philosophers
have
held
that
,
for
a
range
of
mental
states
,
one
cannot
be
mistaken
about
whether
one
is
in
them
.


Thus
,
for
example
,
if
one
sincerely
judges
that
one
has
a
pain
,
or
that
one
believes
that
P
,
then
it
cannot
turn
out
that
one
is
not
in
pain
,
or
that
one
does
not
so
believe
.


That
the
kind
of
immunity
to
error
described
by
Wittgenstein
differs
from
this
sort
of
epistemic
security
follows
from
the
fact
that
one
may
be
sceptical
of
the
latter
while
accepting
the
former
.


That
is
,
one
may
reject
the
claim
that
sincere
judgements
that
one
has
a
pain
cannot
be
mistaken
(perhaps
it
is
possible
to
mistake
a
sensation
of
coldness
for
one
of
pain)
,
whilst
nevertheless
maintaining
that
if
one
is
introspectively
aware
of
a
pain
,
then
that
pain
must
be
one’s
own
.


Immunity
to
errors
of
this
sort
has
been
taken
,
by
a
number
of
philosophers
,
to
be
importantly
connected
to
self-consciousness
.



Under
the
influence
of
Shoemaker
(1968)
this
phenomenon
has
become
known
as
immunity
to
error
through
misidentification
relative
to
the
first-person
pronoun
,
or
IEM
.


On
Shoemaker’s
formulation
,
an
error
of
misidentification
occurs
when
one
knows
some
particular
thing
,
a
,
to
be
F
and
judges
that
b
is
F
on
the
grounds
that
one
mistakenly
believes
that
a
is
identical
to
b
.


To
this
it
is
important
to
add
that
IEM
is
not
a
feature
that
judgements
possess
in
virtue
of
their
content
alone
but
only
relative
to
certain
grounds
(perception
,
testimony
,
introspection
,
memory
,
etc
.

)
.


Thus
,
the
judgement
that
I
am
jealous
of
a
might
be
IEM
when
grounded
in
introspection
,
but
not
when
grounded
in
the
overheard
testimony
of
my
analyst
.


For
I
may
have
misinterpreted
my
analyst’s
words
,
wrongly
taking
his
use
of
“Smith”
in
“Smith
is
Jealous
of
a”
to
refer
to
me
(“Smith”
after
all
is
a
common
name)
.


IEM
is
always
relative
,
then
,
to
the
grounds
on
which
a
judgement
is
based
.


Which
grounds
might
give
rise
to
first-person
judgements
that
are
IEM
is
a
contested
matter
,
see
the
supplement
:
The
Scope
of
Immunity
to
Error
Through
Misidentification
.



On
this
account
,
first-person
thoughts
will
be
IEM
relative
to
certain
grounds
just
in
case
errors
of
misidentification
are
not
possible
with
respect
to
them
.


That
is
,
they
will
be
IEM
relative
to
grounds
G
if
and
only
if
it
is
not
possible
that
one
knows
,
via
G
,
some
particular
thing
,
a
,
to
be
F
and
judges
oneself
to
be
F
in
virtue
of
mistakenly
believing
that
a
is
identical
to
oneself
.


Whilst
precise
formulations
differ
in
various
ways
,
this
can
reasonably
be
thought
of
as
the
standard
account
of
IEM
(see
,
for
example
,
Shoemaker
1968
,
1970
,
1986
,
2012
;

1995

.



An
alternative
way
of
formulating
IEM
can
be
found
in
the
work
of
variety
of
philosophers
.


On
this
view
,
a
judgement
“a
is
F”
is
IEM
if
and
only
if
it
is
not
possible
to
undercut
one’s
evidence
for
judging
that
a
is
F
without
thereby
undercutting
one’s
evidence
that
someone
is
F
(for
variations
on
this
idea
,
see
Hamilton
1995
;
Wright
1998
;
Pryor
1999
;
Campbell
1999a
;
2002
:
ch
.


5
;
for
discussion
see
Coliva
2006
;
Smith
2006a
;
McGlynn
2016
and
2021)
.


As
Wright
puts
it
,
a
claim


made
on
a
certain
kind
of
ground
involves
immunity
to
error
through

misidentification
just
when
its
defeat
is
not
consistent
with

retention
of
grounds
for
existential
generalization
.


(1998
:
19)

The
idea
is
that
,
for
a
wide
range
of
judgements
it
is
possible
that
one
knows
that
something
is
F
but
wrongly
supposes
that
a
is
F
.


That
is
,
one
has
misidentified
which
thing
is
F
.


For
other
judgements
,
perhaps
including
the
introspection
based
judgement
that
one
has
a
headache
,
this
sort
of
identification
error
is
not
possible
.


After
Pryor’s
(1999)
influential
discussion
,
this
is
typically
known
as
immunity
to
which-misidentification
,
or
wh-IEM
.



That
wh-IEM
is
a
distinct
phenomenon
from
IEM
as
it
is
standardly
formulated
is
shown
by
the
fact
one
may
consistently
claim
that
a
form
of
experience
,
for
example
memory
,
does
not
put
one
in
a
position
to
think
,
of
some
a
distinct
from
oneself
,
that
a
was
F
,
yet
nevertheless
does
put
one
in
a
position
to
think
that
someone
was
F
.


That
is
,
it
might
give
rise
to
judgements
that
are
IEM
but
not
wh-IEM
.


The
converse
,
however
,
is
not
possible
.


For
since
“a
was
F”
entails
“someone
was
F”
,
it
will
not
be
possible
for
a
judgement
,
relative
to
some
grounds
,
to
be
wh-IEM
without
it
also
being
IEM
.


If
a
judgement
is
based
on
an
identification
,
it
will
be
subject
to
errors
of
wh-misidentification
.


For
this
reason
,
wh-IEM
might
legitimately
be
considered
the
more
fundamental
notion
(as
it
is
by
Pryor
1999)
.



What
is
the
philosophical
significance
of
IEM
?


First
,
consider
what
it
would
take
for
a
form
of
experience
to
ground
thoughts
that
are
IEM
.


Suppose
that
a
form
of
experience
,
introspection
for
example
,
itself
has
first-personal
content
.


That
is
,
suppose
that
the
content
of
introspective
awareness
is
not
adequately
conceptualised
as
pain
but
rather
requires
the
first-personal
form
,
my
pain
.


If
so
,
then
there
would
be
no
need
for
an
identification
of
some
object
as
oneself
,
for
the
identity
of
the
subject
of
pain
is
already
given
as
oneself
.


On
this
way
of
thinking
,
to
determine
which
forms
of
experience
ground
judgements
that
are
IEM
would
be
to
determine
which
forms
of
experience
have
first-personal
content
.


And
that
,
according
to
some
philosophers
,
is
to
determine
which
forms
of
experience
are
themselves
forms
of
self-consciousness
(see
,
for
example
,
Bermúdez
1998
:
144)
.


This
issue
is
further
discussed
in
§3
.



Second
,
Wittgenstein
suggests
that
the
phenomenon
of
IEM
is
responsible
for
the
(in
his
view
,
mistaken)
opinion
that
the
use
of
“I”
as
subject
refers
to
an
immaterial
soul
(1958
:
66)
.


This
is
for
the
reason
that
one
may
be
tempted
to
suppose
that
if
introspectively
based
self-ascriptions
of
psychological
predicates
do
not
rely
on
an
identification
of
a
bodily
entity
,
they
must
rely
on
the
identification
of
a
non-bodily
entity
(1958
:
70
;
for
related
discussion
,
see
Peacocke
1999
:
ch
.


6
;
Coliva
2012)
.


Wittgenstein’s
view
,
of
course
,
is
that
they
rely
on
no
identification
at
all
.


As
Evans
puts
it
,
they
are
identification-free
.


Essentially
the
same
point
is
made
by
Strawson
in
his
diagnosis
of
“the
fact
that
lies
at
the
root
of
the
Cartesian
illusion”
,
which
is
that
“criterionless”
self-ascription
gives
rise
to
the
idea
of
a
“purely
inner
and
yet
subject-referring
use
for
‘I’”
(P
.


F
.


Strawson
1966
:
164–166)
.


In
short
,
the
fact
that
a
certain
class
of
first-person
thoughts
depend
for
their
reference
on
no
identification
of
myself
as
some
publicly
presented
object
(they
are
identification-free)
gives
rise
to
the
idea
that
they
pick
out
a
private
object
,
a
soul
.


There
is
a
clear
connection
between
this
idea
and
Anscombe’s
(1975)
argument
for
the
non-referential
character
of
“I”
.

Self-Consciousness
in
Experience

Some
philosophers
maintain
that
,
in
addition
to
its
manifestation
in
first-personal
thinking
,
self-consciousness
is
also
present
in
various
forms
of
sensory
and
non-sensory
experience
(Bermúdez
1998
;
Hurley
1998
:
ch
.


4
;
Zahavi
2005
;
Peacocke
2014
;
Musholt
2015)
.


After
all
,
self-consciousness
is
presumably
a
form
of
consciousness
(see
entry
on
consciousness)
.


On
the
view
that
experience
,
like
thought
,
has
representational
content
,
this
can
be
understood
as
the
view
that
experiences
,
like
thoughts
,
can
have
content
that
is
first-personal
.


On
the
further
view
that
the
content
of
experience
is
non-conceptual
(see
the
entry
on
non-conceptual
mental
content)
,
the
claim
is
that
there
is
non-conceptual
first-person
content
(for
a
conceptualist
response
,
see
Noë

Bermúdez
also
argues
that
there
is
a
non-conceptual
form
of
self-conscious
thinking
that
arises
from
non-conceptual
self-conscious
experience
,
which
he
calls
“protobelief”
(Bermúdez
1998
:
ch

Bermúdez

.



The
claim
that
there
is
a
form
of
self-consciousness
in
experience
,
one
which
arguably
grounds
the
capacity
to
entertain
first-personal
thought
,
can
be
understood
in
a
number
of
ways
.


According
to
one
view
there
is
a
perceptual
,
or
quasi-perceptual
,
consciousness
of
the
self
as
an
object
of
experience
.


On
another
,
there
is
a
“pre-reflective”
form
of
self-consciousness
that
does
not
involve
the
awareness
of
the
self
as
an
object
.


A
third
claims
that
various
forms
of
experience
involve
a
distinctive
“sense
of
ownership”
in
which
each
of
us
is
aware
of
our
own
states
as
our
own
.


In
each
case
,
the
question
is
whether
the
mode
of
experience
in
question
can
,

Peacocke’s

words
,
act
as
the
“non-conceptual
parent”
of
the
first-person
concept
and
associated
phenomena

in
particular
that
of
immunity
to
error
through
misidentification

1
Consciousness
of
the
Self

It
is
natural
to
suppose
that
self-consciousness
is
,
fundamentally
,
a
conscious
awareness
of
the
self
.


On
such
a
view
,
one
is
self-conscious
if
,
when
one
introspects
,
one
is
aware
of
a
thing
that
is
,
in
some
sense
,
presented
as
oneself
.


This
is
the
view
,
mentioned
in
§1
.

2
,
that
Hume
seems
to
be
rejecting
with
his
claim
that
when
he
introspects
he
can
never
catch
himself
,
but
only
perceptions
(Hume
1739–40
:
bk
.


1
,
ch
.


4
,
§6)
.


Whilst
Hume’s
claim
has
been
very
influential
,
it
has
not
found
universal
acceptance
.


Those
siding
with
Hume
include
Shoemaker
(1986)
,
Martin
(1997)
,
Howell
(2010
;
2023
,

.

,
and

(2012)
(for
a
related
,
Jamesian
perspective

him

(2010)
and

(2012)
.



As
with
first-person
thought
,
the
issue
is
not
whether
one
is
,
or
can
be
,
conscious
of
what
is
in
fact
oneself
.


If
that
were
sufficient
for
self-consciousness
then
,
on
the
supposition
that
one
is
identical
to
one’s
body
,
seeing
oneself
in
a
mirror
would
be
a
case
of
self-consciousness
,
even
if
one
were
unaware
that
it
was
oneself
that
one
saw
.


Rather
,
the
issue
is
whether
one
is
,
or
can
be
,
conscious
of
oneself
as
oneself
,
a
form
of
awareness
in
which
it
is
manifest
to
one
that
the
object
of
awareness
is
oneself
.


If
there
is
such
an
awareness
then
this
is
philosophically
significant
,
since
one
might
expect
it
to
ground
certain
cases
of
self-knowledge
,
first-person
reference
,
and
the
immunity
to
error
of
certain
first-person
thoughts
(Shoemaker
1986
;
see
the
entry
on
self-knowledge)
.


The
inner
consciousness
of
the
self
as
F
,
for
example
,
would
account
for
one’s
capacity
to
refer
to
oneself
as
oneself
,
one’s
knowledge
that
one
is
F
,
and
the
fact
that
such
a
thought
cannot
rest
on
a
misidentification
of
another
thing
as
oneself
.


On
the
other
hand
,
the
claim
that
there
is
no
such
conscious
awareness
of
the
self
is
philosophically
significant
,
not
only
because
it
undermines
the
possibility
of
such
explanations
but
also
for
the
reason
that
it
plays
an
important
role
in
various
well
known
arguments
:
for
example
,
in
Kant’s
First
Critique
(1781/1787)
,
most
obviously
the
Transcendental
Deduction
,
the
Refutation
of
Idealism
,
and
the
Paralogisms
,
and
in
Wittgenstein’s
discussion
of
the
conceptual
problem
of
other
minds
(Kripke
1982
:
Postscript)
.



A
simple
argument
for
the
claim
that
we
are
introspectively
aware
of
ourselves
is
that
in
introspection
one
is
perceptually
aware
of
one’s
own
mental
properties
,
and
that
when
one
perceives
a
property
one
perceives
that
which
has
that
property
,
i
.

e
.


,
oneself
.


Shoemaker
(1984b
,
1986)
agrees
that
if
there
is
an
introspective
awareness
of
the
self
as
an
object
,
then
it
should
be
understood
as
a
form
of
self-perception
.


He
argues
,
however
,
that
,
on
a
plausible
account
of
perception
,
introspection
is
not
a
form
of
perception
,
so
we
do
not
introspectively
perceive
anything
,
including
the
self
.


As
such
,
we
cannot
conclude
in
this
way
that
we
are
introspectively
aware
of
the
self
(cf
.


Martin
1997
;
Rosenthal
2012)
.



Shoemaker
further
argues
,
in
a
way
reminiscent
of
the
Heidelberg
School
(Frank
1995
;
Musholt
2015
:
ch
.


1)
,
that
the
postulation
of
an
introspective
awareness
of
the
self
as
the
self
would
not
be
in
a
position
to
explain
all
self-knowledge
.


According
to
Shoemaker
(1984b
:
105)
,
if
inner
perception
revealed
an
object
to
be
F
,
then
I
would
only
be
in
a
position
to
judge
that
I
am
F
if
I
already
took
myself
to
be
that
object
that
I
perceive
.


But
this
both
presupposes
some
(non-perceptual)
self-knowledge
(i
.

e
.


,
that
I
am
the
thing
perceived
via
inner
sense)
,
and
also
implausibly
opens
up
introspection
based
first-person
thought
to
the
possibility
of
errors
of
misidentification
,
since
such
a
view
would
entail
that
introspective
self-knowledge
is
based
in
part
on
an
identification
of
the
self
.



A
number
of
philosophers
have
maintained
that
,
even
if
Hume
is
right
that
introspection
does
not
reveal
the
self
as
an
object
,
there
is
another
form
of
perceptual
experience
which
does
:
bodily
awareness
(see
entry)
.

this
claim

,
Ayers
(1991)

Brewer
(1995)
,
Cassam
(1995
,
1997)
,
Bermúdez
(1998
,
2011)
.


On
this
view
,
through
bodily
awareness
I
am
aware
of
my
body
“from
the
inside”
as
a
bodily
self
,
as
me
.


Brewer
(1995)
,
for
example
,
argues
that
since
bodily
sensations
are
both
manifestly
properties
of
oneself
and
are
perceived
as
located
properties
of
one’s
body
,
it
follows
that
in
bodily
awareness
one
perceives
one’s
body
as
oneself
.



If
one’s
body
is
presented
as
oneself
in
bodily
awareness
then
,
as
mentioned
above
,
we
might
expect
this
bodily
self-perception
to
ground
first-person
thought
about
one’s
bodily
states
.


As
pointed
out
in
§2
,
it
is
plausible
that
first-person
thoughts
cannot
fail
to
refer
to
their
thinker
and
further
that
this
is
manifest
in
the
thinking
of
them
.


Martin
(1995
,
1997)
argues
on
the
basis
of
these
two
claims
that
if
bodily
awareness
is
a
form
of
self-awareness
,
then
one’s
body
as
presented
in
bodily
awareness
must
manifestly
be
oneself
.


That
is
,
if
a
form
of
awareness
is
to
ground
judgements
which
are
manifestly
about
myself
,
then
that
form
of
awareness
must
manifestly
be
an
awareness
of
myself
.


But
this
is
arguably
a
condition
that
it
does
not
meet
,
since
it
is
perfectly
coherent
to
wonder
whether
or
not
one
is
identical
to
one’s
body
,
just
as
Descartes
famously
did
in
the
Meditations
(for
a
different
,
imagination-based
,
argument
against
bodily
awareness
as
a
form
of
self-awareness
,

Smith

self-consciousness
and
imagination

.



Another
way
in
which
it
can
be
argued
that
the
self
figures
in
sensory
experience
is
in
the
self-locating
content
of
perceptual
experience
,
most
notably
vision
.


Visual
experience
is
perspectival
,
containing
information
not
only
about
perceived
objects
but
also
of
their
spatial
relation
to
the
perceiver
:
I
see
the
wall
as
in
front
of
me
,
the
bookcase
as
to
my
left
,
and
so
on
.


The
(bodily)
self
,
it
might
be
argued
,
is
experienced
as
an
object
in
the
world
,
the
point
of
origin
of
egocentric
perception
(Cassam
1997

52–53

.


On
an
alternative
view
,
one
consistent
with
the
rejection
of
any
sort
of
awareness
of
the
self
as
an
object
,
visual
perception
does
not
present
the
self
at
its
point
of
origin
,
but
rather
represents
the
locations
of
perceived
objects
in
monadic
terms
,
as
ahead
,
to
the
left
,
and
so
on
,
without
specifying
what
it
is
that
they
are
ahead
,
or
to
the
left

Pre-Reflective
Self-Consciousness

If
first-person
thought
is
not
grounded
in
an
awareness
of
the
self
as
an
object
,
then
some
other
account
is
arguably
required
to
account
for
the
capacity
to
entertain
self-conscious
thought
(O’Brien
1995a)
.


One
suggestion
is
that
subjects
possess
a
form
of
“pre-reflective
self-awareness”
as
a
necessary
condition
of
consciousness
(Sartre
1937
,
1943
:
Introduction
;
Zahavi
2005
,
2007
;
Legrand
2006
;
cf
.

2009
;

&
Williford

.


For
criticism
,
see
Schear
2009
;
also
see
the
entry
on
phenomenological
approaches
to
self-consciousness)
.


On
this
view
,
all
conscious
experience
involves
an
implicit
awareness
of
oneself
as
its
subject
without
explicitly
representing
the
self
as
an
object
of
awareness
(cf
.


Musholt’s
distinction
between
“self-representationalist”
and
“non-self-representationalist”
accounts
of
non-conceptual
self-consciousness
(2015
:
chs
.


3–4))
.


Indeed
,
it
might
be
argued
that
the
necessity
of
an
active
agent’s
possessing
some
form
of
self-awareness
follows
from
the
connection
between
action
and
self-consciousness
that
many
suppose
to
have
been
established
by
considerations
of
the
essential
indexical
discussed
in
§2
.

1
(cf
.


Bermúdez
1998)
.



These
views
are
closely
associated
with
theories
that
explain
consciousness
in
terms
of
self-consciousness
(§4
.

3)
.


Pre-reflective
self-awareness
is
“pre-reflective”
,
according
to
its
proponents
,
in
the
sense
that
it
does
not
require
one
to
explicitly
reflect
on
one’s
own
mental
states
,
or
to
otherwise
take
them
as
objects
of
attention
.


Rather
,
pre-reflective
self-awareness
is
manifest
even
in
those
situations
in
which
one’s
attention
is
directed
outwards
toward
worldly
objects
and
events
.


Pre-reflective
self-awareness
,
then
,
is
implicit
in
all
consciousness
,
providing
one
with
a
continuous
awareness
of
oneself
as
the
subject
of
one’s
stream
of
experience
.



One
way
in
which
such
views
can
be
understood
is
as
maintaining
that
experience
involves
self-consciousness
in
the
mode
,
rather
than
the
content
,
of
conscious
experience
(Recanati
2007
:
part
5
;
2012
;
O’Brien
2007
:
ch
.


6)
.


This
can
be
fleshed
out
by
analogy
with
the
case
of
belief
:
one
might
claim
that
the
concept
of
truth
figures
in
the
mode
,
but
not
the
explicit
content
of
every
belief
.


That
is
,
whilst
every
belief
is
a
holding
true
,
it
is
not
the
case
that
every
belief
has
the
content
that
such
and
such
is
true
.


Similarly
,
whilst
every
experience
is
an
experience
of
one’s
own
,
it
is
not
the
case
that
every
experience
has
the
content
that
such
and
such
is
experienced
by
oneself
.


Rather
,
the
mode
of
conscious
experience
(introspection
,
bodily
awareness
,
etc
.

)
includes
an
implicit
awareness
of
the
self
.


A
related
view
is
that
the
self
can
be
considered
an
“unarticulated
constituent”
of
the
experience
,
just
as
some
claim
that
“here”
is
an
unarticulated
constituent
of
“It
is
raining”
(Perry
1986
;
Recanati
2007
:
parts
9
&
10
;
for
scepticism
about
unarticulated
constituents
,
see
Cappelen
&
Lepore
2007)
.


So
,
just
as
the
person
who
believes
“It
is
raining”
is
implicitly
aware
of
the
fact
that
it
is
here
that
it
is
raining
,
so
the
subject
of
self-conscious
experience
is
implicitly
aware
of
the
fact
that
it
is
she
herself
who
is
undergoing
that
experience
.



Accounts
of
self-consciousness
as
involving
unarticulated
constituents
,
or
as
implicit
in
the
mode
of
consciousness
,
will
need
to
explain
how
the
transition
is
made
from
such
implicit
self-awareness
to
the
explicit
representation
of
the
self
in
first-person
thought
.


One
option
is
to
appeal
to
the
idea
that
certain
sources
of
information
are
self-tracking
or
,
in
Perry’s
(2012)
words
,
“necessarily
self-informative”
.


A
form
of
experience
is
self-tracking
if
it
is
a
way
of
coming
to
know
of
the
instantiation
of
properties
of
a
certain
type
and
,
necessarily
,
a
subject
can
come
to
know
,
in
that
way
,
of
the
instantiation
of
her
own
states
only
.


For
example
,
if
it
is
true
that
a
subject
can
only
remember
conscious
episodes
from
her
own
past
,
then
episodic
memory
is
self-tracking
.


If
so
,
then
the
subject
may
legitimately
think
the
first-person
thought
“I
was
F”
,
on
the
basis
of
her
episodic
memory
of
being
F
.


This
account
may
also
be
used
to
explain
IEM
,
since
if
a
form
of
experience
is
self-tracking
,
then
it
will
not
be
possible
for
me
to
know
,
in
that
way
,
that
a
is
F
but
mistakenly
think
that
it
is
me
that
is
F
on
the
grounds
that
I
mistakenly
believe
myself
to
be
identical
to
a
(Perry
2012
;
Recanati
2012
;
cf
.


Campbell
1999a
;
Martin
1995)
.


Here
we
have
an
architectural
feature
of
a
given
form
of
experience
(that
it
is
necessarily
an
awareness
of
oneself)
being
employed
in
an
explanation
of
an
epistemic
feature
of
self-ascriptions
based
on
such
experience
(that
they
are
not
partly
grounded
in
an
identity
judgement)
.


If
I
know
,
in
the
relevant
way
,
that
a
is
F
,
then
it
must
be
the
case
that
I
am
a
.


On
this
view
,
making
a
first-person
judgement
grounded
in
a
given
form
of
experience
is
a
matter
of
articulating
the
unarticulated
self
.


The
experience
itself
is
not
explicitly
first-personal
,
representing
the
self
as
oneself
.


Nevertheless
,
it
“concerns”
the
subject
,
in
that

The
Sense
of
Ownership

Pre-reflective
,
or
implicit
,
accounts
of
the
place
of
self-consciousness
in
experience
are
often
associated
with
the
so-called
“sense
of
ownership”
,
or
“sense
of
mineness”
(Flanagan
1992
;
Martin
1995
;
Dokic
2003
;
Marcel
2003
;
Zahavi
2005

Vignemont
2007
,
2013
and
2018
;

;

&
Kriegel
2015
;
de
Vignemont
and

;
García-Carpintero
and
Guillot

.


According
to
some
,
a
fundamental
aspect
of
conscious
experiences
is
that
they
seem
,
in
each
case
,
to
be
mine
.


In
being
aware
of
a
thought
,
action
,
emotion
,
perceptual
experience
,
memory
,
bodily
experience
(and
also
my
body
itself)
,
I
am
aware
of
it
as
being
my
own
.


This
sense
of
ownership
arguably
does
some
work
in
explaining
why
it
seems
difficult
to
conceive
of
what
it
would
be
like
to
experience
a
thought
as
located
in
another’s
mind
,
or
a
pain
as
located
in
another’s
body
(Martin
1995
;
Dokic
2003)
.


For
such
an
experience
would
involve
being
aware
of
a
thought
that
seemed
to
be
mine
but
as
located
in
a
mind
that
did
not
seem
to
be
my
own
.


The
sense
of
ownership
is
also
a
candidate
for
explaining
immunity
to
error
through
misidentification
since
if
conscious
experiences
seem
to
be
one’s
own
,
then
there
is
presumably
no
need
for
any
identification
of
the
experience’s
subject
as
oneself
.



Whilst
the
sense
of
ownership
would
,
presumably
,
be
accounted
for
by
an
introspective
awareness
of
the
self
,
it
can
also
arguably
be
explained
with
the
more
minimal
commitments
of
the
implicit
view
.


The
sense
of
an
experience
as
my
own
can
be
understood
as
nothing
over
and
above
the
fact
that
the
self
is
implicitly
given
in
the
mode
of
conscious
awareness
(Musholt
2015
:
§4
.

2)
.


Thus
the
focus
on
the
sense
of
ownership
might
be
thought
to
provide
a
minimal
answer
to
Humean
scepticism
about
self-perception
.


As
Chisholm
points
out
,
for
example
,
although
Hume
complained
that
he
could
find
no
self
in
introspection
,
he
reported
his
findings
in
first-personal
terms
.


That
is
,
he
was
aware
not
only
of
his
mental
states
,
but
also
aware
of
them
as
his
own
(Chisholm
1976
:
ch

.

.

,
attack
on
the
“no-ownership”
view)
.



Even
within
the
context
of
an
implicit
account
of
self-consciousness
in
experience
,
we
can
further
distinguish
between
reductive
and
non-reductive
construals
of
the
sense
of
ownership
(Bermúdez
2011
;
Zahavi
&
Kriegel
2015
;
Alsmith
2015)
.


For
example
,
Zahavi
and
Kriegel
(2015
;
cf
.


Kriegel
2003
,
2009
;
Zahavi
2014)
defend
a
non-reductive
understanding
of
the
sense
of
ownership
as
a
distinct
aspect
of
the
phenomenal
character
of
experience
.


By
contrast
,
a
reductive
account
will
explain
the
sense
of
ownership
in
terms
of
cognitive
and/or
experiential
states
whose
existence
we
are
independently
willing
to
endorse
.


For
example
,
Bermúdez
(2011
:
161–166)
argues
in
favour
of
a
reductive
account
of
the
sense
of
ownership
over
one’s
own
body
,
according
to
which
it
consists
in
nothing
more
than
the
phenomenology
of
the
spatial
location
of
bodily
sensations
alongside
our
disposition
to
judge
the
body
in
which
they
occur
to
be
our
own
(cf
.


Dainton
2008
:
§8
.

2
;
Prinz
2012)
.


Bermúdez’s
argument
for
the
reductive
view
is
,
in
part
,
based
on
the
claim
that
,
despite
appearances
,
the
non-reductive
sense
of
ownership
is
not
in
fact
able
to
explain
first-personal
judgements
of
ownership
(cf
.


Schear
2009
;
for
a
response
see
Zahavi
&
Kriegel
2015)
.



It
is
sometimes
claimed
that
the
variety
of
ways
in
which
self-consciousness
can
break
down
poses
a
challenge
to
the
claim
that
the
sense
of
ownership
is
a
universal
characteristic
of
experience
(e

Metzinger

.


Thought
insertion
,
anarchic
hand
,
alien
limb
,
anonymous
memory
,
and
anonymous
vision
,
all
seemingly
involve
subjects
who
are
aware
of
their
own
conscious
states
,
actions
,
or
body
parts
,
but
without
being
aware
of
them
as
their
own
(for
references
,
see
the
supplement
:
The
Scope
of
Immunity
to
Error
Through
Misidentification)
.


It
has
also
been
claimed
that
the
sense
of
ownership
,
along
with
other
aspects
of
self-consciousness
,
is
degraded
in
both
certain
meditative
practices
(Letheby
&
Gerrans
2017
;
Millière
2017
;
Millière
et
.


al
.


2018)
and
psychedelic
experience
(Millière
et
.


al
.


2018
;
MacKenzie
2022
;
cf
.


Stone
2024)
.


Such
subjects
may
disown
their
experiences
or
attribute
them
to
others
.


For
example
,
in
cases
of
thought
insertion
,
a
symptom
of
schizophrenia
,
subjects
report
that
they
are
aware
of
the
thoughts
of
other
people
or
objects
entering
their
own
minds
(see
,
for
example
,
Saks
2007
:
ch
.


2
;
for
general
discussion
of
schizophrenia
and
self-consciousness
see
Parnas
&
Sass
2011)
.


On
the
assumption
that
such
subjects
are
actually
aware
of
what
are
,
in
fact
,
their
own
thoughts
,
this
might
seem
to
be
a
case
of
a
conscious
experience
that
lacks
the
sense
of
ownership
.


Thus
,
either
the
sense
of
ownership
is
not
a
necessary
feature
of
experience
,
or
perhaps
there
is
no
sense
of
ownership
at
all
(see
,
for
example
,
Chadha
2017
;
for
some
reasons
to
be
generally
sceptical
towards
the
sense
of
ownership
,
see
McLelland
2023)
.



A
common
response
to
this
line
of
thought
involves
,
first
,
distinguishing
between
the
sense
of
ownership
and
the
sense
of
agency
and
,
second
,
claiming
that
subjects
of
thought
insertion
lack
the
latter
whilst
retaining
the
former
(Stephens
&
Graham
2000
;
Gallagher
2004
;
Peacocke
2008
:
§7
.

8
;
Proust
2013
:
ch
.


12)
.


The
sense
of
agency
is
the
awareness
of
being
the
source
or
the
agent
of
some
action
or
activity
,
including
mental
agency
.


It
is
the
sense
that
it
is
me
that
is
thinking
a
given
thought
(Bayne
2008
;
O’Brien
&
Soteriou
2009
;
Proust
2013
:
ch
.


10)
.


According
to
this
standard
view
,
cases
of
thought
insertion
or
anarchic
hand
,
for
example
,
can
be
wholly
explained
by
postulating
a
lack
of
a
sense
of
agency
.


The
usual
sense
of
being
the
agent
of
a
thought
is
lacking
,
but
the
sense
of
ownership
remains
since
the
thought
seems
to
the
subject
be
taking
place
in
their
own
mind
.



We
might
,
however
,
wish
to
make
a
three-way
distinction
between
the
sense
of
agency
(the
sense
that
one
is
the
author
of
a
mental
state)
,
the
sense
of
ownership
(the
sense
that
one
is
the
owner
of
a
mental
state)
,
and
what
we
might
call
the
sense
of
location
(the
sense
that
a
mental
state
is
located
within
one’s
own
mind)
.


The
sense
of
location
might
be
understood
as
being
possessed
if
one
is
aware
of
a
mental
state
in
the
ordinary
way
,
i
.

e
.


,
introspectively
.


Crucial
,
it
would
seem
,
for
evaluating
the
significance
of
thought
insertion
and
related
cases
,
and
so
of
the
standard
view
,
will
be
determining
which
,
if
any
,
of
the
senses
of
agency
,
ownership
,
or
location
remain
intact
.


For
it
might
be
argued
that
what
such
subjects
retain
is
in
fact
the
sense
of
location
,
rather
than
the
sense
of
ownership
.


That
is
,
it
may
be
possible
to
take
their
descriptions
at
face
value
when
they
deny
,
in
thought
insertion
for
example
,
that
the
thoughts
in
question
are
their
own
(or
were
thought
by
them)
,
whilst
nevertheless
accepting
that
the
inserted
thought
occurs
within
the
boundary
of
their
own
mind
(for
criticisms
of
the
standard
view

&
Broome
2009

The
Conditions
of
Self-Consciousness

Much
of
the
philosophical
work
on
self-consciousness
concerns
its
relation
to
a
variety
of
other
phenomena
.


These
include
the
nature
of
personhood
,
rationality
,
consciousness
,
and
the
awareness
of
other
minds
.


In
each
case
we
can
ask
whether
self-consciousness
is
a
necessary
and/or
sufficient
condition
for
the
phenomenon
in
question
.

1
Self-Consciousness
and
Personhood

As
was
mentioned
in
§1
.

2
,
Locke
characterises
a
person
as
“a
thinking
intelligent
Being
,
that
has
reason
and
reflection
,
and
can
consider
it
self
as
it
self
,
the
same
thinking
thing
in
different
times
and
places”
(1700
:
II
.

xxvii
.

9)
.


On
such
a
view
,
self-consciousness
is
essential
to
personhood
.


In
particular
,
on
Locke’s
view
it
is
the
capacity
to
reidentify
oneself
at
different
times
that
is
important
,
a
claim
which
is
in
keeping
with
the
central
role
of
memory
in
his
account
of
personal
identity
(see
Ayers
1991
:
vol
.

Snowdon

;
entry
on
personal
identity)
.


As
such
,
Locke
considers
the
capacity
for
self-conscious
thinking
to
be
a
necessary
condition
of
personhood
.


What
is
less
clear
is
whether
,
on
this
view
,
self-consciousness
is
sufficient
for
personhood
.


One
reason
for
doubt
on
this
score
is
that
since
it
is
concerned
with
self-conscious
thought
the
account
provides
no
reason
to
suppose
that
creatures
that
enjoy
non-conceptual
self-consciousness
are
persons
.


A
second
is
that
the
requirement
of
being
able
to
reidentify
oneself
over
time
is
not
one
that
we
need
consider
met
by
all
self-conscious
creatures
for
,
we
can
suppose
,
it
is
possible
for
a
self-conscious
subject
to
lack
the
conceptual
sophistication
to
understand
the
past
and
future
tense
.



An
alternative
conception
of
personhood
that
also
gives
a
central
role
to
self-consciousness
can
be
found
in
Frankfurt’s
claim
that
it
is
essential
to
persons
to
have
a
capacity
for
reflective
self-evaluation
manifested
in
the
possession
of
what
he
calls
“second-order
volitions”
(Frankfurt
1971
:
110)
.


Second-order
volitions
involve
wanting
a
certain
desire
to
be
one’s
will
,
that
is
wanting
it
to
move
one
to
action
.


A
subject
with
second-order
volitions
has
the
capacity
to
evaluate
their
first-order
desires
and
this
,
it
would
seem
,
involves
being
aware
of
them
as
(potentially)
their
own
.


Thus
persons
,
thought
of
as
subjects
with
second-order
volitions
,
are
self-conscious
(for
discussion
,
see
Watson
1975
;
Dennett
1976
;
Frankfurt
1987
;
Bratman
2007
:
chs
.


5
&
11)
.



An
account
of
persons
that
would
appear
to
distance
that
notion
from
self-consciousness
is
that
offered
by
P
.

F
.


Strawson
in
chapter
3
of
Individuals
,


the
concept
of
a
person
is
the
concept
of
a
type
of
entity
such
that

both
predicates
ascribing
states
of
consciousness
and
predicates

ascribing
corporeal
characteristics
,
a
physical
situation
&c
.


are

equally
applicable
to
a
single
individual
of
that
type
.


(1959
:

101–102
;
for
discussion
,
see
Ayer
1963
;
Hacker
2002)

Frankfurt
points
out
that
this
is
inadequate
as
a
definition
of
personhood
since
“there
are
many
entities
beside
persons
that
have
both
mental
and
physical
properties”
(Frankfurt
1971
:
5)
.


It
may
be
,
however
,
that
Strawson’s
formulation
here
is
somewhat
loose
,
and
that
his
central
idea
is
that
persons
are
those
entities
that
self­-ascribe
both
types
of
predicate
,
a
condition
that
perhaps
rules
out
at
least
most
non-human
animals
.


After
all
chapter
3
of
Individuals
,
entitled
“Persons”
,
is
primarily
concerned
with
the
conditions
of
such
self-ascription
,
with
“the
use
we
make
of
the
word
‘I’”
(P
.

F
.


Strawson
1959
:
94)
.



Strawson’s
primary
goal
is
to
argue
for
the
claim
that
the
concept
of
a
person
is
primitive
,
a
position
that
he
contrasts
,
on
the
one
hand
,
with
Cartesian
dualism
and
,
on
the
other
,
with
what
he
calls
the
“no-ownership
view”
:
a
view
according
to
which
we
don’t
really
self-ascribe
states
of
consciousness
at
all
,
at
least
not
with
the
use
of
“I”
as
subject
(cf
.


Wittgenstein
1953
:
§244
;
1958
:
76
;
Anscombe
1975
;
it
is
controversial
whether
Wittgenstein
ever
really
held
this
view
,
for
discussion
see
Hacker
1990
:
chs
.


5
&
11
;
Jacobsen
1996
;
Wright
1998)
.


To
say
that
the
concept
of
a
person
is
primitive
is
,
on
Strawson’s
account
,
to
say
that
it
is
“logically
prior”
to
the
concepts
subject
and
body
;
persons
are
not
to
be
thought
of
as
compounds
of
subjects
and
bodies
.


Strawson
argues
that
the
primitiveness
of
the
concept
of
a
person
is
a
necessary
condition
of
the
possibility
of
self-consciousness
(P
.

F
.


Strawson
1959
:
98–103)
.


His
argument
is
that
one
can
only
self-ascribe
states
of
consciousness
if
one
is
able
to
ascribe
them
to
others
(for
more
on
this
theme
see
§4
.

4)
.


This
rules
out
Cartesian
dualism
,
since
ascribing
states
of
consciousness
to
others
requires
that
one
be
able
to
identify
others
,
and
one
cannot
identify
pure
subjects
of
experience
or
Cartesian
egos
.


The
condition
that
one
must
be
able
to
ascribe
states
of
consciousness
to
others
also
rules
out
the
“no-ownership
view”
because
such
a
view
is
inconsistent
with
the
fact
that
psychological
predicates
have
the
very
same
sense
in
their
first
and
third
person
uses
.



Closely
related
to
the
no-ownership
view
are
a
family
of
claims
about
persons
that
Parfit
dubs
“reductionism”
(Parfit
1984
:
§79)
.


Two
prominent
members
of
this
family
are
the
claim
that


[a]
person’s
existence
consists
in
the
existence
of
a
brain
and
body
,

and
the
occurrence
of
a
series
of
interrelated
physical
and
mental

event
,
(1984
:
211)

and
that


[t]hough
persons
exist
,
we
could
give
a
complete
description
of

reality
without
claiming
that
persons
exist
.


(1984
:
212)

Parfit’s
reductionism
,
and
its
relation
to
Buddhist
views
of
the
self
,
has
been
widely
discussed
(see
for
example
,
Stone

As
is
the
case
with
the
“no-ownership
view”
it
has
sometimes
been
argued
that
reductionism
is
incompatible
with
self-consciousness
so
,
since
we
are
indisputably
self-conscious
,
reductionism
must
be
false
.


Against
the
claim
that
the
(continued)
existence
of
a
person
consists
merely
in
the
(continued)
existence
of
brain
,
body
,
and
interrelated
physical
and
mental
events
that
do
not
presuppose
anything
about
persons
as
such
,
McDowell
(1997)
for
example
,
argues
from
a
broadly
Evansian
position
on
self-consciousness
(see
the
supplement
:
Evans
on
First
Person
Thought)
that
there
simply
are
no
such
“identity-free
relations”
(1997
:
378)
to
which
a
person’s
identity
could
be
reducible
.


That
is
,
there
is
no
way
of
characterising
memory
and
the
other
psychological
phenomena
relevant
to
personal
identity
without
invoking
the
identity
of
the
person
whose
memory
it
is
.


As
McDowell
puts
it
,


[i]n
continuity
of
“consciousness”
,
there
is
what
appears
to
be

knowledge
of
an
identity
,
the
persistence
of
the
same
subject
through

time
.


(1997
:
361)

Memory
,
at
least
,
cannot
be
employed
in
a
reductive
account
of
persons

Self-Consciousness
and
Rationality

Is
self-consciousness
a
necessary
condition
of
rationality
?


A
number
of
philosophers
have
argued
that
rationality
requires
self-knowledge
which
itself
implies
self-consciousness
(see
Shoemaker
1988
,
1994
;
Burge
1996
;
Moran
2001
;
Bilgrami
2006
;
Boyle
2009
,
2011
;
for
a
general
discussion
of
this
approach
to
self-knowledge
,
see
Gertler
2011
:
ch
.


6)
.


In
his
case
against
perceptual
theories
of
self-knowledge
,
Shoemaker
(1994)
argues
against
the
possibility
of
self-blindness
;
against
,
that
it
is
,
the
possibility
that
a
rational
creature
with
all
the
necessary
concepts
might
be
simply
unaware
of
its
own
sensations
,
beliefs
,
and
so
on
.


A
rational
creature
that
is
in
pain
,
Shoemaker
argues
,
will
typically
desire
to
be
rid
of
her
pain
,
and
this
requires
that
she
believe
that
she
is
in
pain
.


As
Shoemaker
puts
it
,
to
see
rational
responses
to
pain


as
pain
behavior
is
to
see
them
as
motivated
by
such
states
of
the

creature
as
the
belief
that
it
is
in
pain
,
the
desire
to
be
rid
of
the

pain
,
and
the
belief
that
such
and
such
a
course
of
behaviour
will

achieve
that
result
.


(Shoemaker
1994
:
228)

This
belief
,
that
she
is
in
pain
,
is
a
self-conscious
one
;
it
is
a
belief
that
she
herself
is
in
pain
.


This
connection
between
rational
behaviour
and
first-person
thought
is
,
of
course
,
the
one
highlighted
by
Perry’s
(1979)
case
of
the
messy
shopper
in
his
discussion
of
the
essential
indexical
(see
§2
.

1)
.



The
connection
between
rationality
and
self-knowledge
(and
so
self-consciousness)
,
Shoemaker
argues
,
is
even
more
pronounced
in
the
case
of
our
awareness
of
our
own
beliefs
.


Rational
subjects
should
abide
by
certain
strictures
on
the
contents
of
their
beliefs
,
updating
them
in
line
with
new
evidence
,
removing
inconsistencies
,
and
so
on
.


And
this
,
Shoemaker
argues
,
requires
that
they
not
be
self-blind
with
respect
to
their
beliefs
.


It
requires
that
they
are
self-conscious
.


As
Shoemaker
writes
,


in
an
important
class
of
cases
the
rational
revision
or
adjustment
of

the
belief-desire
system
requires
that
we
undertake
investigations

aimed
at
determining
what
revisions
or
readjustments
to
make
[…]
What

rationalizes
the
investigation
are
one’s
higher-order
beliefs
about

what
one
believes
and
has
reason
to
believe
.

The
connection
that
Shoemaker
sees
between
the
requirements
of
rationality
,
on
the
one
hand
,
and
self-awareness
,
on
the
other
,
is
also
stressed
in
so-called
“rationalist”
accounts
of
self-knowledge
,
most
prominently
in
the
work
of
Burge
(1996)
and
Moran
(2001
;
for
critical
discussion
of
the
rationalist
approach
as
an
account
of
self-knowledge

,

.


Burge
focuses
on
the
notion
of
the
critical
reasoner
.


He
writes
,


[t]o
be
capable
of
critical
reasoning
,
and
to
be
subject
to
certain

rational
norms
necessarily
associated
with
such
reasoning
,
some
mental

acts
and
states
must
be
knowledgeably
reviewable
.


(Burge
1996
:
97
;
for

a
fuller
argument
for
the
same
conclusion
,
see
Burge
1998)

On
Burge’s
account
,
the
critical
reasoner
must
be
in
a
position
to
recognise
their
reasons
as
reasons
,
and
that
requires
“the
second
order
ability
to
think
about
thought
contents
or
propositions
,
and
rational
relations
among
them”
(1996
:
97)
.


This
is
for
the
reason
that
belief
involves
commitments
and
such
commitments
involve
meeting
certain
standards—providing
reasons
,
reevaluating
where
necessary
,
and
so
on
.



A
similar
line
of
thought
can
be
found
in
Moran’s
account
of
the
role
of
reflection
on
one’s
own
state
in
practical
deliberation
about
what
to
do
and
how
to
feel
(Moran
2001
:
ch
.


2)
.


Here
the
focus
is
not
so
much
on
critical
reasoning
but
rather
practical
deliberation
as
that
which
requires
self-consciousness
.


This
is
an
idea
that
is
also
central
to
much
of
Korsgaard’s
work
(see
,
in
particular
,
Korsgaard
1996
,
2009)
.


A
central
concern
of
hers
is
to
distinguish
between
the
sort
of
action
of
which
all
animals
are
capable
and
the
sort
of
autonomous
agency
of
which
we
self-conscious
subjects
are
capable
.


The
difference
lies
,
on
her
broadly
Kantian
view
,
in
simply
having
one’s
most
powerful
desire
result
in
action
,
on
the
one
hand
,
and
counting
that
desire
as
a
reason
for
action
,
on
the
other
.


It
is
the
latter
that
is
constitutive
of
autonomous
,
deliberative
action
understood
from
the
perspective
of
practical
reason
.


As
she
writes
,


[w]hen
you
deliberate
it
is
as
if
there
were
something
over
and
above

all
your
desires
,
something
which
is
you
,
and
which
chooses
which

desire
to
act
upon
.


(Korsgaard
1996
:
100)

Self-consciousness
,
on
this
view
,


is
the
source
of
reason
.


When
we
become
conscious
of
the
workings
of

an
incentive
within
us
,
the
incentive
is
experienced
not
as
a
force
or

a
necessity
but
as
a
proposal
,
something
we
need
to
make
a
decision

about
.


(Korsgaard
2009
:
119
;

discussion
of
Korsgaard’s
account
of

the
relation
between
self-consciousness
and
the
perspective
of

practical
reason

example

Nagel
1996
;
Fitzpatrick
2005
;

Soteriou

:
ch
.

.



Self-awareness
,
on
these
views
,
is
a
necessary
condition
of
rationality
(conceived
as
the
capacity
for
critical
reasoning
or
practical
deliberation)
.


Burge
also
makes
it
clear
that
he
regards
the
capacity
for
critical
reasoning
to
be
a
necessary
condition
of
(conceptual)
self-consciousness
,
since
to
master
and
self-ascribe
psychological
concepts
such
as
belief
,
one
must
be
able
to
recognise
their
role
in
reasoning
,
and
so
employ
them
(Burge
1996
:
97
,
n
.

3)
.


As
he
puts
it
,


[a]cknowledging
,
with
the
I
concept
,
that
an
attitude
or
act
is
one’s

own
is
acknowledging
that
rational
evaluations
of
it
which
one
also

acknowledges
provide
immediate
[…]
reason
and
rationally
immediate

motivation
to
shape
the
attitude
or
act
in
accordance
with
the

evaluation
[…]
The
first-person
concept
fixes
the
locus
of

responsibility
.


(Burge
1998
:
253)

The
claim
that
there
is
a
constitutive
connection
between
self-consciousness
and
rationality
has
been
met
with
scepticism
by
Kornblith
(2011
,
2012
:
ch
.


2
;
for
a
related
line
of
thought
,
see
Doris

.


Regarding
the
sort
of
responsiveness
to
reason
involved
in
updating
one’s
beliefs
in
accordance
with
new
evidence—one
of
the
capacities
emphasised
by
both
Shoemaker
and
Burge—Kornblith
argues
that
“[w]hile
such
responsiveness
may
be
achieved
,
at
times
,
by
way
of
reflection
on
one’s
beliefs
and
desires
,
it
does
not
require
any
such
reflection”
(2012
:
49)
.


Rationally
revising
beliefs
in
the
face
of
evidence
,
Kornblith
is
keen
to
point
out
,
is
a
capacity
enjoyed
by
non-reflective
animals
.


He
further
presents
the
rationalist
view
with
a
challenge
:
if
one
thinks
that
(first-order)
beliefs
are
not
themselves
responsive
to
reason
,
how
does
adding
(second-order)
beliefs
help
?


One
response
to
this
challenge
is
to
point
out
that
the
connection
between
self-awareness
and
rationality
that
Shoemaker
finds
is
intended
to
hold
only
for
“an
important
class
of
cases”
(Shoemaker
1994
:
240)
,
that
is
it
holds
for
those
cases
of
belief
revision
that
themselves
qualify
as
exercises
in
rational
investigation
.


On
this
view
,
whilst
non-reflective
creatures
may
have
some
degree
of
rationality
,
their
lack
of
self-consciousness
means
that
they
are
not
,
as
we
are
,
capable
of
fully
rational
deliberation
(for

of
Kornblith’s
scepticism
concerning
the
role
of
self-consciousness

rationality

Self-Consciousness
and
Consciousness

Central
to
the
history
of
the
self-consciousness
sketched
in
§1
is
a
concern
with
the
relation
between
self-consciousness
and
consciousness
.


Since
self-consciousness
is
itself
a
form
of
consciousness
,
consciousness
is
,
of
course
,
a
necessary
condition
of
it
.


But
is
self-consciousness
necessary
for
consciousness
?


Positive
answers
to
this
question
come
in
both
reductive
and
non-reductive
varieties
.



One
way
in
which
consciousness
might
entail
self-consciousness
is
if
the
former
is
reducible
to
the
latter
.


One
such
family
of
views
are
higher
order
theories
of
consciousness
which
maintain
that
a
psychological
state
is
conscious
if
and
only
if
it
is
represented
,
in
the
right
way
,
by
a
higher
order
state
(Gennaro
2004
;
for
a
very
different
account
that
nevertheless
posits
a
tight
connection
between
consciousness
and
self-consciousness
,
see
O’Shaughnessy
2002
:
ch
.


3)
.


A
natural
assumption
is
that
this
higher
order
state
is
distinct
from
that
which
it
represents
.


Higher
Order
theories
that
accept
this
assumption
fall
into
two
camps
:
Higher
Order
Thought
(HOT)
theories
(Rosenthal
1986
,
2005
;
Carruthers
2000
,
2005)
,
which
maintain
that
the
higher
order
state
is
a
thought
or
belief
,
and
Higher
Order
Perception
(HOP)
theories
(Armstrong
1968
;
Lycan
1996
,
2004)
,
which
by
contrast
maintain
that
the
higher
order
state
is
a
perception-like
sensory
state—an
exercise
of
the
sort
of
inner
perception
,
or
“inner
sense”
,
that
was
extensively
debated
throughout
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
(Thiel
2011
;
see
§3
.

1)
.


Since
,
however
,
we
can
be
aware
that
someone
else
is
in
some
conscious
state
,
it
seems
that
simply
being
aware
that
a
thought
is
occurring
is
insufficient
to
render
that
thought
conscious
.


Arguably
,
what
is
required
is
that
one
be
aware
that
one
is
in
the
relevant
first-order
state
.


That
is
,
one
represents
oneself
as
being
in
the
state
in
question
.


Since
this
seems
to
involve
a
form
of
self-awareness
,
the
HOT
and
HOP
theories
can
be
understood
as
holding
that
consciousness
entails
self-consciousness
(Gennaro
1996)
.


Given
this
,
it
is
natural
to
think
of
the
distinction
between
HOT
and
HOP
theories
of
consciousness
as
closely
related
to
that
between
conceptual
and
non-conceptual
self-consciousness
.



An
alternative
to
HOT
and
HOP
theories
that
still
maintains
the
ambition
to
reduce
consciousness
to
self-consciousness
is
the
self-representational
view
(Kriegel
&
Williford
2006
;
Kriegel
2009
;
Caston
2002)
,
according
to
which
a
psychological
state
is
conscious
if
and
only
if
it
represents
itself
.


Such
accounts
are
higher-order
views
that
deny
that
the
first
and
second-order
states
are
distinct
.


As
with
both
HOT
and
HOP
,
self-representationalism
can
be
thought
of
as
supporting
the
view
that
a
form
of
self-consciousness
is
a
necessary
condition
of
consciousness
.


Kriegel
(2003)
dubs
this
“intransitive
self-consciousness”
,
the
phenomenon
purportedly
picked
out
by
phrases
of
the
form
“I
am
self-consciously
thinking
that
P”
,
and
distinguishes
it
from
the
“transitive
self-consciousness”
purportedly
picked
out
by
phrases
of
the
form
“I
am
self-conscious
of
my
thought
that
P”
.


This
is
a
version
of
the
distinction
between
reflective
and
pre-reflective
self-consciousness
discussed
in
§3
.

2
(and
the
views
of
Fichte
and
Sartre
mentioned
in
§1
;
cf
.


Kapitan
1999)
.


If
conscious
states
are
those
that
represent
themselves
then
,
it
might
be
argued
,
consciousness
entails
intransitive
self-consciousness
,
since
one’s
conscious
states
do
not
only
represent
themselves
but
also
(in
some
way
implicitly)
represent
oneself
as
having
them
(Kriegel
2003
:
104)
.



Aristotle
,
considering
a
version
of
the
HOP
theory
,
argued
that
the
view
suffered
from
a
regress
problem
since
the
higher-order
perception
must
itself
be
conscious
and
so
be
accompanied
by
a
HOP
,
which
would
itself
be
conscious
,
and
so
on
(De
Anima
3
.

2
;
Caston
2002)
.


The
standard
way
to
diffuse
such
a
worry
is
to
deny
that
the
higher
order
state
,
be
it
perception
or
thought
,
need
be
conscious
.


An
alternative
,
of
course
,
is
to
endorse
a
self-representational
account
.


There
are
other
objections
to
higher
order
views
,
however
,
each
of
which
applies
to
one
or
more
versions
of
the
view
.


They
include
worries
about
the
possibility
of
objectless
and
non-veridical
higher
order
states
(Byrne
1997
;
Block
2011)
,
worries
about
whether
it
can
account
for
the
conscious
states
of
infants
and
non-humans
(Dretske
1995

,
the
complaint
that
the
postulation
of
a
distinct
higher-order
state
for
every
conscious
state
leads
to
an
unnecessarily
“cluttered
picture
of
the
mind”
(Chalmers

,
and
the
fundamental
worry
that
no
form
of
higher-order
view
has
the
resources
to
explain
consciousness
at
all
(Levine
2006
;
cf
.


Kriegel

.


As
such
,
higher-order
and
self-representational
theories
of
consciousness
,
that
posit
a
necessary
connection
between
consciousness
and
self-consciousness
,
are
far
from
being
established
.



If
consciousness
cannot
be
reduced
to
self-consciousness
,
perhaps
the
latter
is
nevertheless
a
necessary
condition
of
the
former
.


Some
non-reductive
views
,
already
mentioned
,
see
pre-reflective
consciousness
(see
§3
.

,
or
the
sense
of
ownership
(see
§3
.

3)
as
necessary
conditions
of
consciousness
(see
Zahavi
2005)
.


A
different
non-reductive
,
and
broadly
Kantian
,
argument
for
the
claim
that
self-consciousness
is
a
necessary
condition
of
consciousness
first
of
all
claims
that
conscious
experience
is
necessarily
unified
and
,
second
,
that
this
unity
of
consciousness
in
turn
depends
on
self-awareness
.


Of
primary
interest
here
is
the
second
step
which
is
articulated
by
Strawson
in
his
discussion
of
Kant’s
transcendental
deduction
as
the
claim
that
,


if
different
experiences
are
to
belong
to
a
single
consciousness
,

there
must
be
the
possibility
of
self­-consciousness
on
the
part
of
the

subject
of
those
experiences
.

.



One
reason
for
supposing
that
there
is
a
connection
between
self-consciousness
and
the
unity
of
consciousness
is
given
by
Kant
,
who
writes
,


only
because
I
can
comprehend
their
manifold
in
a
consciousness
do
I

call
them
altogether
my
representations
;
for
otherwise
I
would
have
as

multi-coloured
diverse
a
self
as
I
have
representations
of
which
I
am

conscious
.


(Kant
1781/1787
:
B134)

That
is
,
a
single
self
must
be
able
to
“comprehend”
its
own
experiences
together
,
otherwise
they
would
not
really
be
its
own
.


Such
“comprehension”
would
seem
to
involve
self-consciousness
.


As
Kant
famously
puts
it
,


[t]he
I
think
must
be
able
to
accompany
all
my
representations
for

otherwise
something
would
be
represented
in
me
that
could
not
be

thought
at
all
,
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
the
representation

would
either
be
impossible
or
else
at
least
would
be
nothing
for
me
.



(Kant
1781/1787
:
B131–132)

On
this
view
,
it
is
the
unity
of
the
self
that
guarantees
that
co-conscious
experiences
are
jointly
self-ascribable
;
that
unity
requires
self-consciousness
(there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
self-consciousness
is
here
supposed
to
explain
the
unity
of
consciousness
;
cf
.


Dainton’s
strong
and
weak
“I-thesis”
(2000
:
§2
.

3))
.


This
Kantian
picture
is
associated
with
the
claim
that
unified
self-consciousness
requires
a
conception
of
the
world
as
objective
;
as
transcending
the
perspective
that
one
has
on
it
.


The
idea
here
is
that
to
self-ascribe
an
experience
one
must
have
some
grasp
of
the
distinction
between
one’s
(subjective)
experience
that
the
(objective)
condition
of
which
it
is
an
experience
(these
issues

The
claim
that
the
unity
of
consciousness
requires
self-consciousness
can
be
criticised
in
a
number
of
different
ways
.


How
one
evaluates
the
claim
will
depend
on
whether
one
has
conceptual
or
non-conceptual
self-consciousness
in
mind
.


As
Bayne
(2004)
points
out
,
the
claim
that
the
unity
of
consciousness
requires
that
one
possess
the
concept
of
oneself
seems
,
implausibly
,
to
imply
that
conceptually
unsophisticated
infants
and
non-human
animals
could
not
possess
a
unified
stream
of
consciousness
(of
course
,
this
worry
applies
quite
generally
to
views
that
connect
consciousness
with
self-consciousness)
.


The
view
that
non-conceptual
self-consciousness
is
a
necessary
condition
of
the
unity
of
consciousness
would
appear
to
be
vulnerable
to
the
objection
that
it
implausibly
rules
out
the
possibility
of
cases
such
as
Anscombe’s
(1975)
subject
in
a
sensory
deprivation
tank
,
a
case
in
which
the
forms
of
experience
typically
classed
as
forms
of
non-conceptual
self-consciousness
are
lacking
(for
related
cases
see
Bayne
2004
;
also
see
G
.


Strawson
1999)
.


A
different
worry
about
the
connection
between
self-consciousness
and
the
unity
of
consciousness
is
the
“just
more
content”
objection
(B
.


Williams
1978
:
ch
.


3
;
Hurley
1994
;
and
1998
Part
I)
.


The
concern
is
addressed
to
the
view
that
self-consciousness
is
not
merely
a
necessary
condition
of
the
unity
of
consciousness
but
is
that
in
virtue
of
which
it
is
unified
.


For
if
the
self-ascription
of
experiences
is
taken
to
be
that
which
is
responsible
for
the
unity
of
consciousness
,
how
can
we
account
for
the
fact
that
the
self-conscious
thoughts
are
themselves
unified
with
the
first-order
experiences
that
they
supposedly
unify
?


As
Hurley
puts
it
,


self-conscious
or
first-person
contents
[…]
are
just
more
contents
,
to

which
the
problem
of
co-consciousness
[i
.

e
.


,
the
unity
of

consciousness]
also
applies
(1998
:
61)

To
appeal
to
the
third-order
self-ascription
of
the
self-conscious
thought
would
appear
to
invite
a
regress
.

Self-Consciousness
and
Intersubjectivity

What
is
the
connection
between
self-consciousness
and
the
awareness
of
others
?


On
some
views
self-consciousness
requires
awareness
of
others
,
on
another
view
the
awareness
of
others
requires
self-consciousness
.


In
each
case
we
can
distinguish
between
those
accounts
according
to
which
such
awareness
is
merely
an
empirical
condition
from
those
according
to
which
it
is
a
strictly
necessary/sufficient
condition
.


There
is
also
a
distinction
to
be
made
regarding
the
sense
of
“awareness
of
others”
that
is
in
play
:
whilst
some
philosophers
are
concerned
with
knowledge
of
other
minds
,
others
are
content
with
the
representation
of
others
,
veridical
or
not
.



A
familiar
account
of
our
knowledge
of
others
takes
the
form
of
an
argument
from
analogy
(Slote
1970
:
ch
.


4
;
Avramides
2001
:
part
I)
.


The
argument
from
analogy
presents
an
account
of
our
justification
for
moving
from
judgements
about
others’
observable
behaviour
to
judgements
about
their
unobservable
mental
states
.


I
am
aware
from
my
own
case
that
,
say
,
wincing
is
the
result
of
pain
so
,
on
seeing
another’s
wincing
,
I
am
justified
in
judging
them
to
be
in
pain
.


On
this
picture
,
self-awareness
,
as
manifest
in
the
judgement
about
my
own
case
,
is
a
necessary
condition
of
knowledge
of
other
minds
.


In
this
respect
the
view
is
related
to
contemporary
simulation
theory
,
standard
versions
of
which
see
our
capacity
to
attribute
mental
states
to
others
as
dependent
on
our
capacity
to
attribute
them
to
ourselves
(Heal
1986
;
Goldman
2006
:
ch
.


9
;
for
a
simulationist
theory
that
differs
in
this
respect
,
see
Gordon
1996)
.


Associated
with
the
argument
from
analogy
is
a
view
according
to
which
our
grasp
of
mental
state
concepts
is
an
essentially
first-personal
affair
.


That
is
,
we
understand
what
,
for
example
,
pain
is
first
from
our
own
case
(Nagel
1986
:
§2
.

3
;
Peacocke
2008
:
ch
.


5–6
;
it
has
sometimes
been
claimed
that
this
view
gives
rise
to
the
conceptual
problem
of
other
minds
,
see
Wittgenstein
1958
:
§302
;
McGinn
1984
;
Avramides
2001
:
part
II)
.



In
opposition
to
this
package
stand
views
on
which
our
grasp
and
application
of
mental
state
concepts
is
neutral
between
the
first
and
third-person
cases
.


Theory
theorists
,
for
example
,
claim
that
we
attribute
mental
states
to
both
ourselves
and
others
by
means
of
a
(tacitly
held)
psychological
theory
.


They
may
also
hold
that
possession
of
such
a
theory
constitutes
our
grasp
of
mental
state
concepts
(Carruthers
1996
,
2011
:
ch
.


8
;
Gopnik
&
Meltzoff
1997
;
for
an
account
that
combines
elements
of
theory
with
elements
of
simulation
,
see
Nichols
&
Stich
2003)
.


While
such
views
accord
no
priority
to
the
first-person
case
,
they
may
see
a
tight
connection
between
self-consciousness
and
our
capacity
to
think
about
others
:
these
are
simply
two
aspects
of
the
more
general
capacity
to
think
about
the
mind
.


A
distinct
,
though
related
,
family
of
views
see
both
self-consciousness
and
awareness
of
others
as
emerging
from
a
primitive
“adualist”
state
in
which
self
and
other
are
not
distinguished
(Piaget
1937
;
Merleau-Ponty
1960
;
Barresi
&
Moore
1996
;
Hurley
2005
;
Gallese
2005
;
also
see
D
.


Stern
1985
:
part
II)
.


Against
such
“adualist”
views
,
it
is
often
claimed
the
phenomena
of
neonate
imitation
,
joint
attention
,
and
emotion
regulation
show
that
infants
display
an
awareness
of
others
as
others
from
the
very
beginning
of
life
(Meltzoff
&
Moore
1977
;
Trevarthen
1979
;
Hurley
&
Chater
2005
;
Eilan
et
al
.


2005
;
Legerstee
2005
;
Reddy
2008)
.


One
empirical
proposal
is
that
it
is
from
this
early
form
of
social
interaction
and
capacity
to
understand
others
that
self-consciousness
emerges
as
a
self-directed
form
of
mindreading
(Carruthers
2011
;
Carruthers
,
Fletcher
,
&
Ritchie
2012
;
for
an
early
such
account
,
see
Mead
1934)
.


On
such
a
view
the
first-person
case
is
treated
as
secondary
,
reversing
the
traditional
picture
associated
with
the
argument
from
analogy
.



A
more
ambitious
version
of
this
approach
to
the
relationship
between
self-consciousness
and
awareness
of
others
,
prioritizing
the
awareness
of
others
,
is
to
argue
that
knowledge
of
other
minds
is
a
necessary
condition
of
the
possibility
of
self-consciousness
.

known
examples
of
such
arguments

,
view
that
awareness
of
oneself
as
an
object
is
mediated

the
‘look’
of
the

.


Since
knowledge
of
other
minds
is
typically
considered
to
be
open
to
sceptical
doubt
,
and
self-consciousness
is
not
,
such
lines
of
reasoning
can
be
thought
of
as
transcendental
arguments
and
so
potentially
open
to
general
criticisms
of
that
form
of
argument
(Stroud
1968
;
R
.


Stern
1999
,
2000
;
see
the
entry
on
transcendental
arguments)
.


Strawson’s
argument
hinges
on
his
claim
that


the
idea
of
a
predicate
is
correlative
with
that
of
a
range
of

distinguishable
individuals
of
which
the
predicate
can
be

significantly
,
though
not
necessarily
truly
,
affirmed
.

Evans’

This
means
,
Strawson
claims
,
that
one
can
only
ascribe
mental
states
to
oneself
if
one
is
capable
of
ascribing
them
to
others
which
,
in
turn
,
means
that
I
cannot
have
gained
the
capacity
to
think
of
others’
mental
states
by
means
of
an
analogical
reasoning
from
my
own
case
.


This
,
Strawson
argues
,
shows
that
others’
observable
behaviour
is
not
a
“sign”
of
their
mentality
,
but
is
a
“criterion”
of
it
.


In
short
,
we
must
have
knowledge
of
others’
minds
if
we
are
self-conscious
(for
the
full
argument
,

P

.



Davidson’s
transcendental
argument—the
triangulation
argument—connects
self-consciousness
,
knowledge
of
other
minds
,
and
knowledge
of
the
external
world
.


At
its
heart
is
the
claim
that
for
my
thoughts
to
have
determinate
content
there
must
exist
another
subject
who
is
able
to
interpret
me
.


As
Davidson
puts
it
,


it
takes
two
points
of
view
to
give
a
location
to
the
cause
of
a

thought
,
and
thus
to
define
its
content
[…]
Until
a
base
line
has
been

established
by
communication
with
someone
else
,
there
is
no
point
in

saying
one’s
own
thoughts
or
words
have
a
propositional
content
.



(Davidson
1991
:
212–213)

Since
self-conscious
subjects
are
aware
of
the
contents
of
their
thoughts
,
they
must
know
that
there
are
other
minds
,
since
the
sort
of
intersubjective
externalism
that
Davidson
endorses
guarantees
it
.


Self-knowledge
,
on
this
view
,
entails
knowledge
of
others

Self-Consciousness
in
Infants
and
Non-Human
Animals

At
what
age
can
human
infants
be
credited
with
self-consciousness
?


Is
self-consciousness
present
beyond
homo
sapiens
?


Some
theorists
,
for
example
Bermúdez
(1998)
,
claim
that
various
forms
of
perceptual
experience
constitute
a
non-conceptual
form
of
self-consciousness
(see
§3)
.


Others
,
for
example
Rosenthal
(2005)
,
claim
that
phenomenal
consciousness
entails
self-consciousness
.


If
either
view
is
correct
then
self-consciousness
,
of
some
kind
,
can
plausibly
be
attributed
to
creatures
other
than
adult
humans
.


But
when
it
comes
to
more
sophisticated
forms
of
self-awareness
,
matters
are
less
clear
.


What
is
required
is
some
empirical
criterion
for
judging
a
creature
self-conscious
even
if
,
as
with
infants
and
non-human
animals
,
they
are
unable
to
provide
evidence
via
their
use
of
the
first-person
pronoun
.


Such
evidence
,
if
available
,
may
reasonably
be
thought
to
shed
light
on
both
the
phylogenetic
and
ontogenetic
development
of
self-consciousness
(Ferrari
&
Sternberg
1998
;
Terrace
&
Metcalfe
2005
;

the
entries
on
animal
consciousness
and
animal
cognition)

Mirror
Recognition

It
has
sometimes
been
claimed
,
most
forcefully
by
Gallup
and
colleagues
,
that
the
capacity
to
recognise
oneself
in
the
mirror
is
a
marker
of
self-consciousness
(Gallup
1970
;
Gallup
,
Anderson
,
&
Platek
2011
;
Gallup
,
Platek
,
&
Spaulding
2014
;
Gallup
&
Anderson
2020)
.


It
is
easy
to
see
why
this
might
seem
to
be
so
since
,
if
first-person
thought
involves
thinking
about
oneself
as
oneself
,
then
it
is
natural
to
suppose
that
a
capacity
to
recognise
that
a
subject
seen
in
a
mirror
is
oneself
involves
such
a
thought
.


In
Evans’s
(1982)
terminology
such
thoughts
involve
an
“identification
component”
.



Gallup
(1970)
devised
a
test
for
mirror
self-recognition
:
surreptitiously
placing
a
red
mark
on
a
subject’s
forehead
before
exposure
to
a
mirror
,
then
observing
whether
they
touch
the
relevant
spot
.


It
is
well
established
that
chimpanzees
pass
the
mirror
test
while
other
primate
species
fail
(Anderson
&
Gallup
2011)
.


It
has
also
been
claimed
that
dolphins
and
some
elephants
pass
the
test
(Reiss
&
Marino
2001
;
Plotnik
et
.


al
.


2006)
.


With
respect
to
human
infants
,
the
consensus
is
that
success
in
the
mirror
test
begins
at
around
15
to
18
months
of
age
,
and
that
by
24
months
most
children
pass
(Amsterdam
1972
;
M
.


Lewis
&
Brooks-Gunn
1979
;
Nielsen
,
Suddendorf
,
&
Slaughter
2006)
.



It
is
not
universally
accepted
,
however
,
that
success
in
the
mirror
test
is
an
indication
of
self-consciousness
.


For
example
,
Heyes
(1994)
presents
an
influential
critique
of
the
claim
that
it
is
a
marker
of
self-awareness
,
arguing
that
all
that
is
required
for
success
is
that
subjects
be
able
to
distinguish
between
novel
ways
of
receiving
bodily
feedback
in
order
to
guide
behaviour
,
on
the
one
hand
,
and
other
forms
of
incoming
sensory
data
,
on
the
other
.


Such
a
view
,
however
,
needs
to
explain
why
it
is
that
passing
the
mirror
test
seems
to
be
connected
with
the
phenomena
arguably
associated
with
self-consciousness
,
such
as
experiencing
shame
and
embarrassment
(M
.


Lewis
2011)
.


There
remains
,
then
,
significant
controversy
concerning
what
success
in
the
mirror
test
really
shows
,
and
so
whether
it
can
shed
light
on
the
development
of
self-awareness
(see
,
for
example
,

1993

Episodic
Memory

Another
potential
marker
of
self-consciousness
is
episodic
memory
,
the
capacity
that
we
have
to
recollect
particular
episodes
from
our
own
past
experience
(see
Tulving
1983
;
Michaelian
2016
;
entry
on
memory)
.


As
Tulving
describes
it
,
episodic
memory
involves
“autonoesis”
or
“mental
time-travel”
,
the
experience
of
transporting
oneself
in
time
(which
also
has
a
future
oriented
dimension
in
expectation
,
planning
,
and
so
on
;
see
Michaelian
,
Klein
,
&
Szpunar
2016)
.


The
connection
between
memory
and
self-consciousness
is
one
that
is
often
made
(see
§2
.

3
,
§3
,
and
§4
.

1)
.


If
it
is
correct
that
episodic
memory
essentially
involves
a
form
of
self-consciousness
,
and
we
are
able
to
test
for
the
presence
of
episodic
memory
in
non-linguistic
infants
and
animals
,
then
we
have
a
way
of
detecting
the
presence
of
self-conscious
abilities
.


Since
,
however
,
episodic
memory
is
not
the
only
form
of
self-consciousness
,
the
lack
of
it
does
not
indicate
that
a
creature
is
not
self-aware
.


Indeed
,
the
much
discussed
case
of
K
.

C
.


seems
to
be
one
in
which
,
due
to
an
accident
,
someone
has
lost
episodic
memory
but
appears
to
remain
otherwise
self-conscious
(see
Rosenbaum
et
.


al
.


2005)
.



Tulving
himself
argues
that
only
humans
possess
episodic
memory
,
and
only
when
they
reach
the
age
of
around
4
years
(2005
;
also
see
Suddendorf
&
Corballis
2007)
.


Whilst
human
infants
and
non-human
animals
possess
non-episodic
forms
of
memory
such
as
semantic
memory
(remembering
that
such
and
such
is
the
case)
,
they
lack
the
“autonoetic”
consciousness
of
themselves
projected
either
back
or
forwards
in
time
.


For
example
whilst
most
3
year
old
infants
can
remember
presented
information
,
most
are
unreliable
when
it
comes
to
the
question
of
how
they
know—did
they
see
it
,
hear
it
,
etc
.


(Gopnik
&
Graf
1988)
.


The
suggestion
here
is
that
the
development
of
the
reliable
capacity
to
report
how
they
know
some
fact
reflects
the
development
of
the
capacity
to
episodically
remember
the
learning
event
.



In
the
case
of
animals
perhaps
the
most
suggestive
evidence
of
episodic
memory
derives
from
work
on
scrub-jays
,
who
can
retain
information
about
what
food
has
been
stored
,
where
it
was
stored
,
and
when
(Clayton
,
Bussey
,
&
Dickinson
2003)
.


This
evidence
coheres
with
the
“what
,
where
,
when”
criterion
of
episodic
memory
originally
proposed
by
Tulving
(1972)
.


It
is
,
however
,
widely
accepted
that
this
content-based
account
of
episodic
memory—episodic
memory
is
memory
that
contains
information
about
what
happened
,
where
it
happened
,
and
when—is
inadequate
,
since
non-episodic
,
semantic
memory
often
involves
the
retention
of
“what
,
where
,
when”
information
.


Due
to
the
difficulties
in
finding
a
behavioural
test
for
“autonoetic”
consciousness
,
it
is
often
,
though
not
universally
,
claimed
that
there
is
no
compelling
evidence
for
episodic
memory
,
and
thus
this
particular
form
of
self-consciousness
,
in
non-human
animals
(Tulving
2005
;

&
Corballis
2007
;

2016
:

to
apes

perspective

episodic
memory
abilities
come

Metacognition

Another
body
of
research
pertaining
to
the
question
of
self-consciousness
in
infants
and
non-human
animals
is
the
work
on
metacognition
(and
metamemory)
.


The
term
“metacognition”
typically
refers
to
the
capacity
to
monitor
and
control
one’s
own
cognitive
states
,
and
is
manifest
in
one’s
judgements
(or
feelings)
concerning
one’s
own
learning
and
consequent
level
of
certainty
or
confidence
(J
.

D
.


Smith
2009
;
Beran
et
al
.


2012
;
Proust
2013
;
Fleming
&
Frith
2014)
.


The
suggestion
is
that
if
a
creature
is
able
to
monitor
their
own
level
of
confidence
,
they
are
to
that
extent
self-conscious
.


One
common
paradigm
for
testing
metacognitive
abilities
involves
presenting
subjects
with
a
stimulus
that
they
must
categorise
in
one
of
two
ways
.


Crucially
,
they
are
also
given
the
opportunity
to
opt
out
of
the
test
,
with
correct
categorisation
resulting
in
the
highest
reward
,
opting
out
resulting
in
a
lower
reward
,
and
incorrect
categorisation
resulting
in
no
reward
.


The
assumption
is
that
the
opt-out
response
reflects
a
meta-cognitive
judgement
of
uncertainty
.


Evidence
gathered
from
such
a
paradigm
has
been
taken
to
show
metacognitive
abilities
in
some
birds
(Fujita
et
.


al
.


2012)
,
dolphins
(J
.

D
.


Smith
et
.


al
.


1995)
,
primates
(Shields
et
.


al
.


1997)
,
and
children
from
the
age
of
around
4
years
(Sodian
et
.


al
.


2012)
.



The
view
that
success
on
metacognitive
opt-out
tests
is
indicative
of
self-consciousness
is
not
uncontroversial
,
however
.


For
example
,
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
uncertainty
response
is
indicative
not
of
metacognitive
uncertainty
monitoring
but
rather
of
first-order
,
environmental
judgements
concerning
a
third
category
between
the
intended
two
(Kornell
,
Son
,
&
Terrace
2007
;
Hampton
2009
;
also
see
Carruthers
2008
;
Kornell
2014
;
Musholt
2015
:
ch
.


7)
.


On
such
an
interpretation
,
the
research
on
metacognition
does
not
provide
compelling
evidence
regarding
self-consciousness
in
infants
and
non-human
animals
(but
for
critical
discussion
see
J
.

D
.


Smith
2005
;
J
.

D
.


Smith
,
Couchman
,
&
Beran
2014
;
also
relevant
is
the
distinction
between
“evaluativist”
and
“attributivist”
accounts
of
metacognition
outlined
by
Proust
(2013))
.


The
question
of
the
significance
of
opt-out
tests
for
attributions
of
self-consciousness
remains
controversial
.

Nietzsche
on
Bad
Conscience

5
June
2020

A
portrait
of
Friedrich
Nietzsche
,
drawn
in
1905
by
Edvard
Munch
.



Friedrich
Nietzsche
(5
October
1844
–
25
August
1900)
was
mostly
known
for
his
philosophy
.


From
reading
Nietzsche’s
philosophy
,
though
,
one
can
sense
a
breadth
of
interests
:
language
,
history
,
poetry
,
culture
.


Yet
something
consistent
connects
them
:
at
great
lengths
he
explores
the
psychology
of
existence
.


In
particular
,
he
was
interested
in
our
relationship
with
suffering
.


We
have
a
need
to
find
suffering
meaningful
,
Nietzsche
thought
,
creating
purpose
in
a
continuous
process
of
interpretation
and
reinterpretation
.


Thus
spoke
Nietzsche
(hehe)
in
On
the
Genealogy
of
Morality
,
we
tend
to
live
under
creditor-debtor
relationships
.


There
are
higher
creditors
(God
,
society
,
etc
.

)
and
we
,
the
debtors
,
favour
the
‘foretaste’
of
their
higher
status
.


In
these
relationships
we
feel
existential
guilt
(e
.

g
.


from
‘sins’
,
using
goods
and
services
,
etc
.

)
and
embrace—even
enjoy—the
suffering
(e
.

g
.


through
punishment
,
discipline
,
tradition
,
sacrifice
,
sexual
deprivation
…
)
.


However
,
this
psychological
instinct
has
a
way
of
turning
itself
inward
:
‘the
internalizing
of
man
…
what
he
later
calls
his
soul
.

’
Nietzsche
was
not
a
fan
:
such
‘maltreatment’
belongs
to
‘desperate
prisoners’
filled
with
‘longing’
and
without
bodily
instinct
!




'
I
take
bad
conscience
to
be
the
deep
sickness
into
which
man
had
to
fall
under
the
pressure
of
the
most
fundamental
of
all
changes
he
ever
experienced—the
change
of
finding
himself
enclosed
once
and
for
all
within
the
sway
of
society
and
peace
.


Just
as
water
animals
must
have
fared
when
they
were
forced
either
to
become
land
animals
or
to
perish
,
so
fared
these
half
animals
who
were
happily
adapted
to
wilderness
,
war
,
roaming
about
,
adventure—all
at
once
all
their
instincts
were
devalued
and
"disconnected"
.


'


In
Nietzsche’s
nihilism
there
are
no
absolute
values
;
we
inherit
values
from
social
institutions
who
enforce
adherence
for
their
own
power
.


But
when
these
values
stop
servicing
our
lives
we
should
learn
,
as
individuals
,
to
renounce
those
collective
values
and
create
new
ones
which
service
us
once
more
.


Nietzsche’s
worldview
continues
to
resonate
with
many
people
,
especially
the
angsty
.


Go
ahead
and
see
:
type
‘#nihilism’
into
a
social
media
platform’s
search
bar
and
see
what
comes
up
.


However
,
there
is
no
doubt
that
Nietzsche
constructed
a
life-affirming
philosophy
which
sought
to
elicit
individual
spirit
.

Editorial

Consciousness

by
Rick
Lewis

It
gives
me
particular
pleasure
to
introduce
an
issue
focussing
on
consciousness
,
as
I
myself
am
sometimes
conscious
.


I
know
the
same
goes
for
many
of
you
.


But
there
is
a
great
deal
of
debate
among
philosophers
about
what
this
actually
means
.



The
nature
of
consciousness
is
a
philosophical
problem
which
has
come
to
centre
stage
mainly
in
the
last
few
years
.


As
the
neuroscientists
have
gradually
found
out
more
and
more
about
the
workings
of
the
brain
,
philosophers
have
wondered
whether
any
part
of
the
mind
is
inaccessible
to
scientific
investigation
.


Many
have
argued
that
even
if
we
find
out
everything
about
the
way
the
brain
physically
functions
,
there
will
still
be
something
vital
missing
from
our

.


What
this
is
,
of
course
,
is
an
understanding
of
how
our
subjective
experiences
come
about
.


This
is
what
David
Chalmers
calls
the
‘hard
problem’
of
consciousness
.



In
this
issue
we
have
articles
looking
at
this
problem
from
a
wide
variety
of
viewpoints
.


In
the
first
of
them
,
Mary
Midgley
says
that
many
people
talk
about
consciousness
as
if
the
brain
was
in
isolation
.


She
says
we
need
to
step
back
and
see
consciousness
in
its
wider
context
,
which
is
the
context
of
organic
life
.



If
conscious
life
had
to
be
organic
,
this
would
rule
out
the
possibility
of
conscious
machines
.


Professor
Igor
Aleksander
,
(see
interview)
is
an
expert
on
artificial
intelligence
.


He
,
at
least
,
thinks
that
it
is
possible
to
build
robots
which
are
conscious
of
their
surroundings
in
a
sense
broadly
similar
to
the
sense
in
which
we
say
that
humans
are
aware
of
their
surroundings
.


He
aims
to
prove
this
by
actually
building
one
,
and
has
already
made
some
progress
in
that
direction
.



There
is
a
huge
contrast
between
Igor
Aleksander’s
view
and
that
of
the
French
philosopher
Henri
Bergson
(1859-1941)
.


Bergson
was
a
towering
figure
in
French
philosophy
in
the
early
20th
century
–
the
Jacques
Derrida
of
his
day
.


However
,
he
has
gone
into
a
profound
eclipse
.


Reading
John-Francis
Phipps’
article
about
him
,
it
isn’t
hard
to
see
why
–
there
can
be
few
philosophers
less
in
tune
with
the
intellectual
spirit
of
the
early
21st
century
than
our
Henri
.


Still
,
for
that
very
reason
his
ideas
on
consciousness
give
a
completely
different
perspective
on
the
subject
from
that
to
which
we’re
now
accustomed
.



Some
people
approach
the
problem
by
pointing
out
that
consciousness
is
always
consciousness
of
something
.


I
was
conscious
of
the
gathering
clouds
.


You
were
conscious
of
the
rain
falling
on
your
face
.


So
,
they
say
,
consciousness
is
always
directed
towards
something
.


It
has
‘aboutness’
or
in
philo-jargon
,
intentionality
.


This
isn’t
the
only
way
we
talk
about
consciousness
in
everyday
speech
,
however
.


As
Jeanne
Warren
points
out
in
her
article
on
John
Macmurray
,
we
also
use
it
to
mean
the
opposite
of
unconsciousness
–
of
being
asleep
,
or
in
a
coma
.


There
isn’t
necessarily
any
huge
divergence
of
meaning
here
,
as
when
we
say
“Has
Fred
regained
consciousness
?

”
we
might
be
asking
whether
he
has
become
aware
again
of
all
the
various
things
and
people
around
him
.



Though
the
theme
of
this
issue
is
consciousness
,
a
second
,
unanticipated
theme
seems
to
have
crept
in
as
well
.


With
articles
on
Henri
Bergson
,
John
Macmurray
and
John
Herschel
,
we
have
pieces
on
three
thinkers
who
are
regarded
by
some
as
being
unjustly
neglected
.


Bergson
and
Herschel
were
acclaimed
as
giants
in
their
own
day
.


Macmurray
wasn’t
,
but
has
gradually
gathered
admirers
in
the
years
since
his
demise
.



From
one
of
the
most
conceptually
difficult
problems
of
philosophy
,
we
turn
to
one
of
the
most
practically
worrying
ethical
issue
of
today
.


The
headlines
have
been
filled
recently
by
the
misdeeds
of
soldiers
stationed
in
Iraq
–
the
torture
of
prisoners
,
the
deaths
of
civilians
.


In
the
first
article
in
this
issue
,
philosophy
graduate
Douglas
Gearhart
,
who
served
as
a
PSYOPS
(psychological
operations)
specialist
in
Iraq
,
appeals
to
philosophers
to
develop
practical
moral
guidance
and
moral
training
for
soldiers
in
battlefield
situations
.


Scholastic
philosophers
like
Thomas
Aquinas
,
called
this
aspect
of
just
war
theory
jus
in
bello
.


If
Gearhart
is
right
,
it
should
cease
being
seen
as
a
quaint
relic
of
medieval
thought
and
instead
become
the
urgent
concern
of
ethicists
everywhere
.


In
a
way
this
is
also
about
consciousness
,
as
the
choices
soldiers
make
in
wars
are
conscious
choices
,
but
ones
made
under
enormous
stress
and
without
the
steadying
framework
of
everyday
civilian
life
.


How
can
they
recall
more
easily
in
such
situations
a
conscious
awareness
of
the
dignity
and
fragility
of
human
life
?

Article
Summary

Philosophers
have
used
the
term
‘consciousness’
for
four
main
topics
:
knowledge
in
general
,
intentionality
,
introspection
(and
the
knowledge
it
specifically
generates)
and
phenomenal
experience
.


This
entry
discusses
the
last
two
uses
.


Something
within
one’s
mind
is
‘introspectively
conscious’
just
in
case
one
introspects
it
(or
is
poised
to
do
so)
.


Introspection
is
often
thought
to
deliver
one’s
primary
knowledge
of
one’s
mental
life
.


An
experience
or
other
mental
entity
is
‘phenomenally
conscious’
just
in
case
there
is
‘something
it
is
like’
for
one
to
have
it
.


The
clearest
examples
are
:
perceptual
experiences
,
such
as
tastings
and
seeings
;
bodily-sensational
experiences
,
such
as
those
of
pains
,
tickles
and
itches
;
imaginative
experiences
,
such
as
those
of
one’s
own
actions
or
perceptions
;
and
streams
of
thought
,
as
in
the
experience
of
thinking
‘in
words’
or
‘in
images’
.


Introspection
and
phenomenality
seem
independent
,
or
dissociable
,
although
this
is
controversial
.



Phenomenally
conscious
experiences
have
been
argued
to
be
nonphysical
,
or
at
least
inexplicable
in
the
manner
of
other
physical
entities
.


Several
such
arguments
allege
that
phenomenal
experience
is
‘subjective’
;
that
understanding
some
experiences
requires
undergoing
them
(or
their
components)
.


The
claim
is
that
any
objective
physical
science
would
leave
an
‘explanatory
gap’
,
failing
to
describe
what
it
is
like
to
have
a
particular
experience
and
failing
to
explain
why
there
are
phenomenal
experiences
at
all
.


From
this
,
some
philosophers
infer
‘dualism’
rather
than
‘physicalism’
about
consciousness
,
concluding
that
some
facts
about
consciousness
are
not
wholly
constituted
by
physical
facts
.


This
dualist
conclusion
threatens
claims
that
phenomenal
consciousness
has
causal
power
,
and
that
it
is
knowable
in
others
and
in
oneself
.



In
reaction
,
surprisingly
much
can
be
said
in
favour
of
‘eliminativism’
about
phenomenal
consciousness
;
the
denial
of
any
realm
of
phenomenal
objects
and
properties
of
experience
.


Most
(but
not
all)
philosophers
deny
that
there
are
phenomenal
objects
–
mental
images
with
colour
and
shape
,
pain-objects
that
throb
or
burn
,
inner
speech
with
pitch
and
rhythm
,
and
so
on
.


Instead
,
experiences
may
simply
seem
to
involve
such
objects
.


The
central
disagreement
concerns
whether
these
experiences
have
phenomenal
properties
–
‘qualia’
;
particular
aspects
of
what
experiences
are
like
for
their
bearers
.


Some
philosophers
deny
that
there
are
phenomenal
properties
–
especially
if
these
are
thought
to
be
intrinsic
,
completely
and
immediately
introspectible
,
ineffable
,
subjective
or
otherwise
potentially
difficult
to
explain
on
physicalist
theories
.


More
commonly
,
philosophers
acknowledge
qualia
of
experiences
,
either
articulating
less
bold
conceptions
of
qualia
,
or
defending
dualism
about
boldly
conceived
qualia
.



Introspective
consciousness
has
seemed
less
puzzling
than
phenomenal
consciousness
.


Most
thinkers
agree
that
introspection
is
far
from
complete
about
the
mind
and
far
from
infallible
.


Perhaps
the
most
familiar
account
of
introspection
is
that
,
in
addition
to
‘outwardly
perceiving’
non-mental
entities
in
one’s
environment
and
body
,
one
‘inwardly
perceives’
one’s
mental
entities
,
as
when
one
seems
to
see
visual
images
with
one’s
‘mind’s
eye’
.


This
view
faces
several
serious
objections
.


Rival
views
of
introspective
consciousness
fall
into
three
categories
,
according
to
whether
they
treat
introspective
access
(1)
as
epistemically
looser
or
less
direct
than
inner
perception
,
(2)
as
tighter
or
more
direct
,
or
(3)
as
fundamentally
non-epistemic
or
nonrepresentational
.


Theories
in
category
(1)
explain
introspection
as
always
retrospective
,
or
as
typically
based
on
self-directed
theoretical
inferences
.


Rivals
from
category
(2)
maintain
that
an
introspectively
conscious
mental
state
reflexively
represents
itself
,
or
treat
introspection
as
involving
no
mechanism
of
access
at
all
.


Category
(3)
theories
treat
a
mental
state
as
introspectively
conscious
if
it
is
distinctively
available
for
linguistic
or
rational
processing
,
even
if
it
is
not
itself
perceived
or
otherwise
thought
about
.

Class
consciousness
and
false
consciousness
are
concepts
introduced
by
Karl
Marx
that
were
later
expanded
by
social
theorists
who
came
after
him
.


Marx
wrote
about
the
theory
in
his
book
"Capital
,
Volume
1
,"
and
again
with
his
frequent
collaborator
,
Friedrich
Engels
,
in
the
impassioned
treatise
,
"Manifesto
of
the
Communist
Party
.

"
Class
consciousness
refers
to
the
awareness
by
a
social
or
economic
class
of
their
position
and
interests
within
the
structure
of
the
economic
order
and
social
system
in
which
they
live
.


In
contrast
,
false
consciousness
is
a
perception
of
one
'
s
relationships
to
social
and
economic
systems
of
an
individual
nature
,
and
a
failure
to
see
oneself
as
a
part
of
a
class
with
particular
class
interests
relative
to
the
economic
order
and
social
system
.




Marx
'
s
Theory
of
Class
Consciousness


According
to
Marxist
theory
,
class
consciousness
is
an
awareness
of
one
'
s
social
and/or
economic
class
relative
to
others
,
as
well
as
an
understanding
of
the
economic
rank
of
the
class
to
which
you
belong
in
the
context
of
the
larger
society
.


In
addition
,
class
consciousness
involves
an
understanding
of
the
defining
social
and
economic
characteristics
and
collective
interests
of
your
own
class
within
the
constructs
of
the
given
socio-economic
and
political
order
.



Class
consciousness
is
a
core
facet
of
Marx
'
s
theory
of
class
conflict
,
which
focuses
on
the
social
,
economic
,
and
political
relationships
between
workers
and
owners
within
a
capitalist
economy
.


The
precept
was
developed
in
conjunction
with
his
theory
on
how
workers
might
overthrow
the
system
of
capitalism
and
then
go
on
to
create
a
new
economic
,
social
,
and
political
system
based
on
equality
rather
than
inequality
and
exploitation
.




The
Proletariat
vs
.


the
Bourgeoisie


Marx
believed
that
the
capitalist
system
was
rooted
in
class
conflict—specifically
,
the
economic
exploitation
of
the
proletariat
(workers)
by
the
bourgeoisie
(those
who
owned
and
controlled
production)
.


He
reasoned
that
the
system
only
functioned
as
long
as
the
workers
did
not
recognize
their
unity
as
a
class
of
laborers
,
their
shared
economic
and
political
interests
,
and
the
power
inherent
in
their
numbers
.


Marx
argued
that
when
workers
came
to
understand
the
totality
of
these
factors
,
they
would
achieve
class
consciousness
,
and
this
,
in
turn
,
would
lead
to
a
workers
'

revolution
that
would
overthrow
the
exploitative
system
of
capitalism
.



Hungarian
social
theorist
Georg
Lukács
,
who
followed
in
the
tradition
of
Marxist
theory
,
expanded
the
concept
by
saying
that
class
consciousness
is
an
achievement
that
opposes
individual
consciousness
and
results
from
the
group
struggle
to
see
the
"totality"
of
social
and
economic
systems
.




The
Problem
of
False
Consciousness


According
to
Marx
,
before
workers
developed
a
class
consciousness
they
were
actually
living
with
a
false
consciousness
.


(Though
Marx
never
used
the
actual
term
,
he
did
develop
the
ideas
that
it
encompasses
.

)
In
essence
,
false
consciousness
is
the
opposite
of
class
consciousness
.


Individualistic
rather
than
collective
in
nature
,
it
produces
a
view
of
oneself
as
a
single
entity
engaged
in
competition
with
others
of
one
'
s
social
and
economic
standing
,
rather
than
as
part
of
a
group
with
unified
experiences
,
struggles
,
and
interests
.


According
to
Marx
and
other
social
theorists
who
followed
,
false
consciousness
was
dangerous
because
it
encouraged
people
to
think
and
act
in
ways
that
were
counterintuitive
to
their
economic
,
social
,
and
political
self-interests
.



Marx
saw
false
consciousness
as
a
product
of
an
unequal
social
system
controlled
by
a
powerful
minority
of
elites
.


The
false
consciousness
among
workers
,
which
prevented
them
from
seeing
their
collective
interests
and
power
,
was
created
by
the
material
relations
and
conditions
of
the
capitalist
system
,
by
the
ideology
(the
dominant
worldview
and
values)
of
those
who
control
the
system
,
and
by
social
institutions
and
how
they
function
in
society
.



Marx
cited
the
phenomenon
of
commodity
fetishism—the
way
capitalist
production
frames
relationships
between
people
(workers
and
owners)
as
relationships
between
things
(money
and
products)—with
playing
a
key
role
in
producing
false
consciousness
among
workers
.


He
believed
that
commodity
fetishism
served
to
obscure
the
fact
that
relations
with
regard
to
production
within
a
capitalist
system
are
actually
relationships
between
people
,
and
that
as
such
,
they
are
changeable
.



Building
on
Marx
'
s
theory
,
Italian
scholar
,
writer
,
and
activist
Antonio
Gramsci
expanded
the
ideological
component
of
false
consciousness
by
arguing
that
a
process
of
cultural
hegemony
guided
by
those
holding
economic
,
social
,
and
cultural
power
in
society
produced
a
"common
sense"
way
of
thinking
that
embued
the
status
quo
with
legitimacy
.


Gramsci
noted
that
by
believing
in
the
common
sense
of
one
'
s
age
,
a
person
actually
consents
to
the
conditions
of
exploitation
and
domination
that
one
experiences
.


This
"common
sense"—the
ideology
that
produces
false
consciousness—is
actually
a
misrepresentation
and
misunderstanding
of
the
social
relationships
that
define
the
economic
,
social
,
and
political
systems
.




False
Consciousness
in
a
Stratified
Society


An
example
of
how
cultural
hegemony
works
to
produce
false
consciousness—that
is
true
both
historically
and
today—is
the
belief
that
upward
mobility
is
possible
for
all
people
,
regardless
of
the
circumstances
of
their
birth
,
as
long
as
they
choose
to
dedicate
themselves
to
education
,
training
,
and
hard
work
.


In
the
U
.

S
.


this
belief
is
encapsulated
in
the
ideal
of
"the
American
Dream
.

"
Viewing
society
and
one
'
s
place
within
it
based
on
the
set
of
assumptions
derived
from
"common
sense"
thinking
results
in
a
perception
of
being
an
individual
rather
than
part
of
a
collective
.


Economic
success
and
failure
rest
squarely
on
the
shoulders
of
the
individual
and
do
not
take
into
account
the
totality
of
the
social
,
economic
,
and
political
systems
that
shape
our
lives
.



At
the
time
Marx
was
writing
about
class
consciousness
,
he
perceived
class
as
the
relationship
of
people
to
the
means
of
production—the
owners
versus
the
workers
.


While
the
model
is
still
useful
,
we
can
also
think
about
the
economic
stratification
of
our
society
into
different
classes
based
on
income
,
occupation
,
and
social
status
.


Decades
'

worth
of
demographic
data
reveals
that
the
American
Dream
and
its
promise
of
upward
mobility
is
largely
a
myth
.


In
truth
,
the
economic
class
a
person
is
born
into
is
the
primary
determinant
of
how
he
or
she
will
fair
economically
as
an
adult
.


However
,
as
long
as
a
person
believes
the
myth
,
he
or
she
will
continue
to
live
and
operate
with
a
false
consciousness
.


Without
a
class
consciousness
,
they
will
fail
to
recognize
that
the
stratified
economic
system
in
which
they
'
re
operating
was
designed
to
afford
only
the
bare
minimum
of
money
to
workers
while
funneling
huge
profits
to
the
owners
,
executives
,
and
financiers
at
the
top
.

What
to
Know


Though
they
sound
similar
,
conscience
is
a
noun
referring
to
the

awareness
that
one
'
s
actions
are
right
or
wrong
,
as
in
one
'
s
"guilty

conscience
,"
while
conscious
is
an
adjective
meaning
"awake"
or

"alert
.

"
If
you
were
asleep
you
would
be
"unconscious
.

"
To
keep
them

straight
,
remember
to
stay
conscious
of
what
your
conscience
is

telling
you
to
do
.



As
conscientious
lexicographers
,
we
are
conscious
of
the
occasional
mix-up
of
the
words
conscience
and
conscious
.


Here
are
some
examples
that
caught
our
attention
:

,

If
you
stopped
to
double-check
if
conscience
or
conscious
was
actually
being
used
incorrectly
in
any
of
the
above
examples
,
this
article
will
help
you
to
readily
differentiate
the
words
and
use
them
with
confidence
in
the
future—since
,
honestly
,
there
were
no
trick
examples
.


And
if
wrongly
using
conscience
in
place
of
conscious
,
or
vice
versa
,
has
never
been
on
your
conscience
,
we
encourage
you
to
read
on
anyways
.

[statue-of-thinking-man]

It
'
s
our
moral
obligation
to
help
.



Conscience
and
conscious
derive
from
the
same
Latin
roots—the
prefix
com-
("with
,"
"together
,"
"jointly")
and
the
verb
scire
("to
know")
,
and
the
combination
,
conscire
,
means
"to
be
aware
of
guilt"—and
both
relate
to
a
state
of
awareness
,
the
first
of
a
moral
awareness
and
the
second
of
a
physical
or
mental
wakefulness
in
which
a
person
is
aware
of
their
surroundings
.


English
speakers
are
first
made
aware
of
conscience
in
the
13th
century
,
and
conscious
in
the
16th
.



Conscience
and
conscious
have
similar
pronunciations
,
which
,
for
some
,
causes
confusion
.


(Their
first
syllables
are
pronounced
the
same
,
and
they
both
contain
a
middle
\sh\
sound
.

)
For
those
who
hesitate
on
which
to
use
,
learning
the
words
'

suffixes
and
their
meanings
and
also
the
words
'

parts
of
speech
might
be
the
best
approach
in
differentiating
them
.


Conscience
,
having
the
noun
suffix
-ence
,
meaning
"quality
or
state
,"
is
,
well
,
a
noun
,
and
conscious
,
having
the
adjective
suffix
-ous
,
meaning
"having
,"
is
an
adjective
.



What
Does
Conscience
Mean
?



The
noun
conscience
refers
to
a
state
of
awareness
or
a
sense
that
one
'
s
actions
or
intentions
are
either
morally
right
or
wrong
,
along
with
a
feeling
of
obligation
to
do
the
right
thing
.


Cartoons
often
personify
the
conscience
as
a
proverbial
angel/devil
pair
who
talk
into
the
ear
of
an
indecisive
character
,
encouraging
him
or
her
to
follow
either
a
path
of
moral
virtue
or
of
moral
corruption
.


In
the
Walt
Disney
movie
Pinocchio
,
metaphorically
,
the
conscience
is
the
dapper
talking
cricket
,
named
Jiminy
Cricket
,
whose
maxim
"always
let
your
conscience
be
your
guide"
he
teaches
the
title
character
,
a
marionette
who
is
magically
brought
to
life
and
becomes
a
real
human
boy
after
proving
himself
brave
,
truthful
,
and
selfless
(after
listening
to
his
conscience)
.


Some
examples
of
the
noun
conscience
are
:


You
should
decide
what
to
do
according
to
your
own
conscience
.




Her
conscience
was
bothering
her
,
so
she
finally
told
the
truth
.




I
cannot
do
anything
that
is/goes
against
my
conscience
.




He
could
not
in
good
conscience
allow
this
situation
to
continue
.




I
have
to
tell
you
the
truth
because
I
don
'
t
want
this
on
my

conscience
any
longer
.



What
Does
Conscious
Mean

Conscious
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
an
adjective
that
indicates
that
a
person
is
awake
and
alert
and
able
to
understand
what
is
happening
around
them
,
such
as
a
patient
who
becomes
fully
conscious
after
being
administered
anesthesia
.


It
can
also
imply
that
a
person
is
aware
of
a
particular
fact
or
feeling
,
such
as
an
investor
who
is
conscious
of
risk
or
athletes
who
are
conscious
of
being
role
models
for
young
people
.


Another
common
meaning
of
conscious
describes
a
person
who
cares
about
something
specified
,
such
as
the
cost-conscious
shopper
and
the
environmentally
conscious
activist
.


Additionally
,
conscious
can
modify
an
act
or
decision
that
is
done
deliberately
(and
one
that
might
very
well
result
in
conscious
guilt
or
a
guilty
conscience)
.



Hopefully
,
you
are
now
fully
(or
at
least
semi-)
conscious
of
the
differences
in
using
conscience
and
conscious—the
most
essential
one
being
that
conscience
is
a
noun
and
conscious
is
an
adjective
,
which
describes
nouns
.


Keep
in
mind
that
whenever
you
are
in
a
difficult
situation
,
you
should
be
conscious
about
what
your
conscience
is
telling
you
.


Your
conscience
will
help
you
make
moral
,
just
,
and
fair
decisions
.


As
for
remembering
the
spelling
of
the
noun
:
conscience
contains
the
word
science
(also
a
noun)
,
and
as
science
tells
us
how
the
forces
of
nature
and
the
universe
behave—or
should—the
conscience
tells
us
how
we
should
behave—or
should
.

FALSE
consciousness
is
a
term
used
to
describe
the
way
in
which
exploited
,
oppressed
or
disadvantaged
groups
in
society
accept
,
assimilate
and
indeed
actively
defend
or
promote
ideas
which
ultimately
act
against
their
own
interests
.

 

It
can
apply
to
individuals
,
to
the
working
class
as
a
whole
,
or
to
sections
of
it
.

 It
is
closely
related
to
the
idea
of
hegemony
(see
Q&A
82)
and
to
Marxist
concepts
of
alienation
,
reification
and
fetishism
(see
Q&A
51)
.



“False
consciousness” often
manifests
itself
as
so-called
“common
sense”
.

 Examples
include
the
notion
that
capitalism
,
“private
enterprise”
,
profit
,
“the
market” is
simply
how
things
are
.

 That
those
who
have
power
or
earn
more
do
so
because
they
are
brighter
or
work
harder
than
the
rest
of
us
;
that
differences
in
opportunity
or
in
the
social
position
of
men
and
women
are
natural
,
determined
by
their
genes
;
that
the
status
quo
is
simply
just
“the
way
the
world
works” and
can’t
be
changed
.


 

False
consciousness
is
related
to
the
ever
changing
economic
and
social
base
of
capitalism
.


Marx
and
Engels
declared
:
“The
ideas
of
the
ruling
class
are
in
every
epoch
the
ruling
ideas
,
ie the
class
which
is
the
ruling
material
force
of
society
,
is
at
the
same
time
its
ruling
intellectual
force
.



“The
class
which
has
the
means
of
material
production
at
its
disposal
,
has
control
at
the
same
time
over
the
means
of
mental
production
,
so
that
thereby
,
generally
speaking
,
the
ideas
of
those
who
lack
the
means
of
mental
production
are
subject
to
it
.


The
ruling
ideas
are
nothing
more
than
the
ideal
expression
of
the
dominant
material
relationships
,
the
dominant
material
relationships
grasped
as
ideas
;
hence
of
the
relationships
which
make
the
one
class
the
ruling
one
,
therefore
,
the
ideas
of
its
dominance
.

”

Marx
and
Engels
argued
that
false
consciousness
applies
particularly
in
regard
to
abstract
ideas
,
such
as
property
rights
, “ie ideas
which
increasingly
take
on
the
form
of
universality
.


For
each
new
class
which
puts
itself
in
the
place
of
one
ruling
before
it
,
is
compelled
,
merely
in
order
to
carry
through
its
aim
,
to
represent
its
interest
as
the
common
interest
of
all
the
members
of
society
,
that
is
,
expressed
in
ideal
form
:
it
has
to
give
its
ideas
the
form
of
universality
,
and
represent
them
as
the
only
rational
,
universally
valid
ones”
.


 

The
term
“false
consciousness” was
first
used
by
Engels
who
emphasised
that
it
was
not
simply
a
passive
absorption
of
ruling-class
ideas
and
values
,
but
involves
an
active
acquiescence
in
adopting
and
developing
those
ideas
:
“a
process
accomplished
by
the
so-called
thinker
consciously
,
indeed
,
but
with
a
false
consciousness”
.

 
False
consciousness
was
an
aspect
of
ideology
but
,
Engels
declared
,
had
been
neglected
by
Marxists
because
of
“the
fatuous
notion
of
the
ideologists
that
because
we
deny
an
independent
historical
development
to
the
various
ideological
spheres
which
play
a
part
in
history
we
also
deny
them
any
effect
upon
history
.

”
 

Gramsci
in
the
1930s
further
developed
the
notion
of
false
consciousness
as
part
of
the
political
superstructure
,
as
a
vehicle
for
delivering
capitalist
hegemony
–
the
dominant
but
changing
set
of
cultural
and
ideological
norms
which
determine
the
boundaries
of
what
can
and
cannot
be
said
without
inviting
ridicule
or
antagonism
and
which
helps
the
existing
system
to
address
its
own
contradictions
,
adapt
and
survive
.


 

False
consciousness
is
in
part
a
consequence
of
the
hegemony
of
propaganda
,
of
the
institutions
of
the
capitalist
state
including
education
and
the
media
,
which
encourages
,
and
for
some
individuals
rewards
,
obedience
,
submission
and
conformity
.


 

But
it
manifests
itself
–
and
is
reinforced
– in
multiple
ways
in
everyday
life
.

 It
expresses
itself
(for
example)
in
commodity
fetishism
—
the
way
relationships
between
people
(workers
and
owners)
are
framed
as
relationships
between
things
(money
and
products)
.



Commodity
fetishism
obscures
the
fact
that
relations
between
people
and
products
reflect
relationships
between
people
and
that
they
can
therefore
be
changed
.

 

False
consciousness
reveals
itself
above
all
in
conformity
–
how
the
need
to
keep
a
job
to
pay
the
rent
or
mortgage
,
feed
the
kids
,
heat
the
home
,
enjoy
the
occasional
luxury
becomes
seen
as
normal
,
the
natural
state
of
affairs
whilst
those
who
reap
the
rewards
of
your
labour
are
simply
enjoying
the
rights
of
ownership
.



Ultimately
,
false
consciousness
legitimates
the
power
of
the
ruling
class
.

 

Marx
and
Engels
declared “in
the
last
analysis
,
the
dominant
ideas
of
a
society
are
the
ideas
of
its
ruling
class”
–
legitimating
a
situation
in
which
one
class
has
power
.

 As
Terry
Eagleton
puts
it
,
ideology
is
“an
element
in
that
complex
structure
of
social
perception
which
ensures
that
the
situation
in
which
one
social
class
has
power
over
the
others
is
either
seen
by
most
members
of
the
society
as
‘natural’
,
or
not
seen
at
all
.

” 
 

But
(especially
in
its
cultural
aspects)
“ideology
is
never
a
simple
reflection
of
a
ruling
class’s
ideas
:
on
the
contrary
,
it
is
always
a
complex
phenomenon
,
which
may
incorporate
conflicting
,
even
contradictory
,
views
of
the
world
.

”

Engels
for
example declared
that
art
is
far
richer
and
more
“opaque” than
political
and
economic
theory
because
it
is
less
explicit
,
less
purely
ideological
.

 So
challenging
false
consciousness
is
not
(just)
a
matter
of
political
education
and
social
argument
.

 As
the
excellent
culture
pages
in
this
paper
show
,
the
battle
is
also
important
in
the
cultural
sphere
.

 

The
literary
critic
Ernst
Fischer
declared
that
art
can
(and
that
good
art
always
does)
transcend
the
ideological
limits
of
its
time
“yielding
us
insights
into
the
realities”
.



False
consciousness
is
the
antithesis
of
class
consciousness
,
of
the
development
of
a
“class
for
itself”
.


Class
consciousness
involves
forging
a
counter-culture
which
sees
beyond
the
limitations
of
capitalism
.

 

That
task
is
vital
where
the
contradictions
of
capitalism
are
most
apparent
–
in
the
workplace
,
in
our
transport
or
energy
supply
systems
,
in
the
food
chain
,
in
the
climate
crisis
.

 

But
it
is
critical
also
in
neighbourhoods
,
in
communities
,
in
everyday
life
.


 

In
the
decades
following
the
collapse
of
“existing
socialism” in
the
Soviet
Union
and
subsequently
elsewhere
,
not
least
(for
example)
in
Yugoslavia
(which
had
a
very
different
model
of
social
organisation
and
political
engagement)
some
on
the
left
experienced
self-doubt
.

 

Some
even
conceived
that
capitalism
represented
“the
end
of
history” –
that
self-interest
and
exploitation
was
the
inevitable
state
of
humanity
.

 

But
socialism
survived
–
and
survives
– not
least
in
Cuba
,
in
perhaps
the
least propitious
of
circumstances
,
due
to
the
consciousness
and
engagement
of
workers
and
communities
in
protecting
the
gains
of
their
revolution
.


And
socialist
ideas
continue to
inspire
struggles
for
social
justice
and
progress
throughout
the
world
.

 

In
Britain
,
too
,
resistance
to
capitalism’s
escalating
economic
crisis
and
public
support
for
struggles
over
jobs
,
pay
,
conditions
,
and
the
social
wage
reflects
a
growing
understanding
that
things
can
and
must
change
.



Central
to
Marx’s
concept
of
historical
materialism
is
the
understanding
that
it
is
not
consciousness
that
determines
people’s
existence
,
but
their
social
existence
that
determines
their
consciousness
.

 

However
the
form
that
consciousness
takes
can
vary
.

 As
Gawain
Little
pointed
out
in
an
article
in
this
paper
,
the
hegemony
exercised
by
capital
is
in
a
constant
process
of
being
remade
and
reconfigured
.

 

As
he
argued
,
“It
is
not
enough
to
propose
alternatives
,
or
even
to
fight
to
win
people
to
them
.


We
must
change
the
very
‘common
sense’ of
society
,
enabling
people
to
envision
a
future
beyond
capitalism
.

”
 

That
is
probably
the
single
biggest
challenge
facing
all
socialists
today
.

This
post
is
Part
I
of
a
series
.



The
field
of
consciousness
studies
has
come
of
age
.


Prior
to
the
1990s
,
theories
of
consciousness
were
more
of
a
philosophical
pursuit
than
a
serious
scientific
one
.


This
was
largely
because
scientists
considered
the
domain
of
subjective
experience—which
is
what
consciousness
fundamentally
is—to
be
,
well
,
too
subjective
.


It
just
didn’t
seem
amenable
to
objective
empirical
study
using
the
scientific
method
.


And
the
whole
concept
of
consciousness
was
considered
too
slippery
and
vague
.



Quicksand
?



Even
now
,
in
my
own
very
practically-oriented
clinical
field
of
psychiatry—one
which
relies
heavily
on
subjective
self-report
by
patients—when
I
talk
with
colleagues
about
my
interest
in
the
science
of
consciousness
and
tell
them
about
the
scientific
conferences
focused
on
it
,
which
I
like
to
attend
,
I
am
met
with
comments
such
as
this
one
from
a
recent
email
exchange
:
“You
brave
,
brave
man
,
you—willing
to
wade
into
the
bottomless
pit
of
quicksand
that
is
consciousness
studies…
I
run
,
screaming
,
in
the
opposite
direction
.

”

My
response
to
this
quip
was
to
point
out
that
a
quick
glance
at
the
program
of
the
particular
conference
I
had
just
returned
from
would
attest
to
the
fact
that
this
field
has
matured
into
a
rigorous
and
rapidly
developing
sphere
of
neuroscience
,
with
considerably
less
quicksand
than
before
.


An
additional
criticism
could
legitimately
be
that
the
topic
of
consciousness
has
attracted
a
huge
number
of
mystical
woo
practitioners
,
but
even
if
99
percent
of
the
field
were
comprised
of
pseudoscience
,
this
conference
and
the
large
,
vibrant
scientific
community
it
represents
would
certainly
be
the
other
1
percent
.



The
hard
problem

Inevitably
,
attempts
to
scientifically
explain
consciousness
run
up
against
the
“explanatory
gap”
or
what
is
called
the
“hard
problem”
of
consciousness—the
problem
of
subjective
experience
:
Why
it
feels
like
something
to
be
conscious
.

¹
Or
,
as
the
philosopher
Thomas
Nagel
famously
formulated
it
:
“something
that
it
is
like
to
be
.

”²
The
so-called
“easy
problems”
concern
questions
like
how
the
brain
processes
information
,
how
different
sensory
inputs
are
integrated
,
how
memories
are
formed
,
and
how
we
can
selectively
focus
our
attention
.


They
are
“easy”
relative
to
the
hard
problem
in
that
they
are
more
scientifically
tractable
.



Correlates
vs
.


explanations

In
the
early
decades
of
the
revival
of
scientific
interest
in
studying
consciousness
,
research
focused
on
identifying
the
“neural
correlates
of
consciousness”
(NCCs)
,
which
are
the
essential
neural
events
needed
to
produce
conscious
states
.


That
search
concentrated
on
brain
states
closely
tied
to
consciousness
.


Over
time
,
more
attention
has
been
directed
toward
developing
theories
of
consciousness
(ToCs)
.


While
the
NCC
approach
looks
for
correlations
between
brain
activity
and
consciousness
,
ToCs
seek
explanatory
links
between
neural
mechanisms
and
aspects
of
consciousness
.



A
proliferation
of
theories

Presently
we
are
still
at
a
relatively
early
stage
in
the
scientific
study
of
consciousness
.


At
this
point
,
there
are
a
great
many
theories
of
consciousness
proliferating
and
competing
with
each
other
.


Those
theories
sometimes
seem
to
talk
past
each
other
as
they
explore
vastly
different
approaches
to
the
problem
.


Attempting
to
understand
the
various
ToCs
and
how
they
contrast
with
one
another
can
be
quite
overwhelming
,
even
for
those
with
a
good
deal
of
familiarity
with
the
field
.



In
recent
years
,
there
have
been
a
number
of
academic
papers
attempting
to
catalogue
and
compare
the
various
theories
.

³
Still
,
for
the
general
reader
,
it
can
all
be
quite
confusing
and
impenetrable
.


This
five-part
blog
series
will
attempt
to
make
some
of
the
major
theories
more
accessible
to
a
general
,
educated
readership
.


Only
a
few
major
theories
will
be
covered
here
.


Several
others
have
already
been
previously
covered
in
my
other
blog
posts
.

Four
leading
contenders

Among
the
most
helpful
recent
academic
journal
articles
comparing
different
theories
of
consciousness
is
a
2022
paper
by
Anil
Seth
and
Tim
Bayne
.

⁵

Seth
and
Bayne
focus
their
review
mainly
on
the
following
four
prominent
theoretical
approaches
to
consciousness
.


I
will
briefly
summarize
these
here
in
simple
terms
:

1
.


Higher-order
theories
(HOTs)
:
These
theories
propose
that
thoughts

become
conscious
when
basic
perceptions
(“lower-order”

representations)
become
re-represented
as
higher-order

representations
at
higher
levels
of
the
brain
,
specifically
in
the

prefrontal
cortex
.


2
.


Global
workspace
theories
(GWTs)
:
According
to
these
theories
,

perceptions
,
thoughts
,
emotions
,
etc
.


become
conscious
when
they

gain
access
to
a
“workspace
,”
or
to
apply
another
analogy
,
when
they

make
it
into
the
“spotlight”—as
if
the
mind
were
a
theater
where

conscious
thought
is
the
activity
in
the
spotlight
on
the
stage
at
a

given
moment
(except
that
,
unlike
in
the
analogy
,
the
actual

workspace
in
the
brain
is
not
localized
but
rather
is
distributed

across
the
frontal
and
parietal
regions
of
the
cortex
,
according
to

the
theory)
.


3
.


Integrated
information
theory
(IIT)
:
This
theory
is
about
how
parts

of
a
brain
interact
to
create
a
unified
experience
.


Consciousness
is

theorized
to
be
related
to
how
much
information
is
integrated
among

the
different
parts
of
the
brain
.


IIT
tries
to
mathematically

measure
this
.


The
more
information
that
is
connected
and
integrated
,

the
more
conscious
the
system
is
thought
to
be
.


The
theory
suggests

that
not
just
brains
but
any
complex
system
with
the
right
level
of

interconnectedness
and
integration
of
information
could
exhibit

consciousness
,
with
simpler
systems
manifesting
only
an

insignificant
modicum
of
consciousness
.


IIT
attempts
to
explain
the

quality
of
conscious
experience
,
suggesting
that
the
unique
pattern

of
relationships
between
the
elements
of
the
system
is
what
defines

a
particular
conscious
experience
.


4
.


Re-entry
and
predictive
processing
theories
:
The
core
claim
of

re-entry
theory
and
predictive
processing
is
that
conscious
mental

states
are
associated
with
top-down
signaling
.


Top-down
signaling

refers
to
the
process
by
which
higher-level
brain
regions
send

information
,
expectations
,
or
context
to
lower-level
brain
regions
.



This
communication
helps
shape
how
the
brain
perceives
and

interprets
bottom-up
information
received
via
its
sense
organs
from

the
world
around
it
.


(Predictive
processing
theories
are
not

specifically
theories
of
consciousness
but
are
more
general
accounts

of
brain
function
that
can
be
used
to
formulate
ideas
about
the

properties
of
consciousness
.

Other
strong
contenders

Besides
the
above
four
categories
of
theories
,
Seth
and
Bayne
also
acknowledge
other
well-developed
approaches
to
consciousness—ones
that
involve
attention
,
learning
,
and
affect
:

Theoretical
approaches
focused
on
attention
:

-
Attention
schema
theory
(AST)
:
This
is
discussed
in
my
post
“Is

Consciousness
an
Illusion
?

”

Theoretical
approaches
focused
on
learning
:

-
Unlimited
associative
learning
(UAL)
:
This
is
discussed
in
my
post

“Learning
May
Be
the
Key
to
the
Evolution
of
Consciousness
.

”
UAL

arguably
has
the
strongest
evolutionary
grounding
of
all
the

theories
.

⁶
-
Other
learning-based
theories
overlap
with
some
theories
described

under
the
four
main
sets
of
theories
listed
above
,
such
as
Axel

Cleeremans’
version
of
higher-order
theory
(HOT)
and
Victor
Lamme’s

local
recurrency
account
.

⁷
-
Learning-based
theories
are
also
closely
related
to
“selectionist”

approaches
,
which
ground
consciousness
in
evolutionary-like
dynamics

within
and
between
neuronal
populations
(referring
to
Gerald

Edelman’s
Neural
Darwinism
theory)
.

⁸

Affect-based
theories
:

-
Damasio’s
“self
comes
to
mind”
theory
:
According
to
this
theory
,

consciousness
depends
on
interactions
between
homeostatic
routines

and
multilevel
interoceptive
maps
,
with
affect
and
feeling
at
the

core
.

⁹
This
is
discussed
in
my
posts
“Are
We
All
Zombies
?

”
and
“The

Brain
as
a
Prediction
Machine
:
The
Key
to
the
Self
?

”
-
Some
proposals
mix
an
affect-based
emphasis
with
predictive

processing
to
ground
conscious
experiences
in
control-oriented

interoceptive
predictions
.


This
refers
to
the
way
the
brain
controls

the
body’s
internal
organs
and
physiological
parameters
by
making

predictions
about
what
they
should
be
.


For
example
,
the
brain

predicts
what
the
body’s
blood
glucose
level
should
be
and
then

sends
signals
to
adjust
that
state
if
it
deviates
from
predictions

(Anil
Seth’s
“beast
machine”
theory—discussed
in
my
posts
“The
Brain

as
a
Prediction
Machine
:
The
Key
to
Consciousness
?

”
and
“The
Key
to

the
Self
?

”
and
Lisa
Feldman
Barrett’s
theory¹⁰)
.


-
Some
affect-based
theories
consider
cortical
mechanisms
to
be

unnecessary
for
consciousness
,
suggesting
instead
that
the

mechanisms
of
consciousness
are
located
in
the
brainstem
(e
.

g
.


,
the

theories
of
Mark
Solms¹¹
and
Bjorn
Merker¹²)

In
future
parts
of
this
blog
series
,
we
will
discuss
HOTs
,
GWTs
,
IIT
,
re-entry
and
predictive
processing
theories
,
following
which
we
will
be
in
a
better
position
to
judge
whether
the
field
is
any
closer
to
solving
the
“hard
problem”
of
consciousness
,
or
whether
there
really
is
such
a
problem
at
all
.

The
subjective
quality
of
a
conscious
experience
is
also
referred
to
as
“qualia”
–
for
example
the
redness
of
red
.


Is
the
experience
of
seeing
redness
the
same
for
you
as
for
me
?


We
assume
it
is
,
but
there’s
no
really
objective
way
to
tell
.


And
why
and
how
should
the
visual
experience
even
have
this
“redness”
quality
at
all
,
as
the
product
of
electrical
and
chemical
signals
reverberating
in
our
physical
brains
?


The
answers
to
these
questions
are
not
self-evident

Another
theory
of
consciousness
with
a
strong
evolutionary
grounding
is
Feinberg
and
Mallatt
'
s
theory
,
which
was
previously
reviewed
by
me
but
was
not
mentioned
in
Seth

.


Feinberg
and
Mallatt
'
s
theory
is
broadly
in
agreement
with

According
to
this
theory
,
consciousness
depends
on
re-entrant
interactions
reflecting
a
history
of
value-dependent
learning
events
shaped
by
selectionist
principles
.

The
term
interoceptive
refers
to
perception
of
sensory
signals
that
originate
from
within
the
body
,
especially
in
the
gut
and
other
internal
organs
,
as
opposed
to
exteroceptive
,
which
refers
to
stimuli
from
the
external
environment

Abstract

Recent
years
have
seen
a
blossoming
of
theories
about
the
biological
and
physical
basis
of
consciousness
.


Good
theories
guide
empirical
research
,
allowing
us
to
interpret
data
,
develop
new
experimental
techniques
and
expand
our
capacity
to
manipulate
the
phenomenon
of
interest
.


Indeed
,
it
is
only
when
couched
in
terms
of
a
theory
that
empirical
discoveries
can
ultimately
deliver
a
satisfying
understanding
of
a
phenomenon
.


However
,
in
the
case
of
consciousness
,
it
is
unclear
how
current
theories
relate
to
each
other
,
or
whether
they
can
be
empirically
distinguished
.


To
clarify
this
complicated
landscape
,
we
review
four
prominent
theoretical
approaches
to
consciousness
:
higher-order
theories
,
global
workspace
theories
,
re-entry
and
predictive
processing
theories
and
integrated
information
theory
.


We
describe
the
key
characteristics
of
each
approach
by
identifying
which
aspects
of
consciousness
they
propose
to
explain
,
what
their
neurobiological
commitments
are
and
what
empirical
data
are
adduced
in
their
support
.


We
consider
how
some
prominent
empirical
debates
might
distinguish
among
these
theories
,
and
we
outline
three
ways
in
which
theories
need
to
be
developed
to
deliver
a
mature
regimen
of
theory-testing
in
the
neuroscience
of
consciousness
.


There
are
good
reasons
to
think
that
the
iterative
development
,
testing
and
comparison
of
theories
of
consciousness
will
lead
to
a
deeper
understanding
of
this
most
profound
of
mysteries
.

What

?

[What
are
the
four
main

of
consciousness
?

In
the
early
days
of
modern
consciousness
science
,
back
in
the
1990s
,
researchers
focused
on
identifying
empirical
correlations
between
aspects
of
conscious
experience
and
properties
of
brain
activity
.


This
search
for
the
“neural
correlates
of
consciousness”
was
motivated
in
part
as
a
response
to
concerns
,
pervasive
through
much
of
the
20th
century
,
that
consciousness
lay
beyond
the
remit
of
science
altogether
.


But
despite
its
many
successes
,
this
approach
is
limited
because
correlations
aren’t
explanations
,
no
matter
how
many
you
identify
.



In
recent
years
,
however
,
there
has
been
a
blossoming
of
neurobiological
theories
of
consciousness
.


This
is
a
sign
of
the
field’s
growing
maturity
,
because
it
is
only
when
couched
in
terms
of
a
theory
that
experimental
findings
can
deliver
a
satisfactory
understanding
of
consciousness
.



There
are
currently
four
main
theoretical
approaches
in
consciousness
science
.


According
to
higher-order
theories
,
a
mental
state
is
conscious
when
another
mental
state
–
higher
up
in
a
hierarchy
–
says
that
it
is
.


For
these
theories
,
the
devil
is
in
the
detail
about
what
kinds
of
“higher-order”
representations
count
for
consciousness
.



Global
workspace
theories
propose
that
mental
states
are
conscious
when
they
are
broadcast
widely
throughout
the
brain
,
so
that
they
can
be
used
to
flexibly
guide
behaviour
.


A
good
way
to
think
about
global
workspace
theory
is
that
consciousness
depends
on
“fame
in
the
brain”
–
conscious
mental
states
have
access
to
a
wide
range
of
cognitive
processes
in
ways
that
unconscious
mental
states
don’t
.

Take
our
online
consciousness
course
,
where
experts
Anil
Seth
,
Nicola
Clayton
and
Christof
Koch
reveal
neuroscience’s
deepest
mystery

These
two
theories
focus
on
functional
aspects
of
consciousness
and
emphasise
frontal
(at
the
front)
and
parietal
(towards
the
back
and
off
to
the
sides)
brain
regions
.


By
contrast
,
integrated
information
theory
focuses
on
phenomenological
aspects
of
consciousness
–
what
it
is
like
,
experientially
–
and
proposes
that
consciousness
is
associated
with
a
posterior
cortical
“hot
zone”
,
located
towards
the
back
of
the
brain
and
including
parts
of
the
parietal
,
temporal
and
occipital
lobes
.


According
to
this
theory
,
consciousness
depends
on
the
ability
of
a
system
to
generate
integrated
information
.



The
fourth
approach
,
known
as
predictive
processing
,
is
more
indirect
,
being
used
primarily
to
build
explanatory
bridges
between
aspects
of
consciousness
and
their
underlying
neural
mechanisms
.


There
are
several
examples
of
this
approach
,
ranging
from
those
which
associate
consciousness
with
top-down
signalling
in
the
brain
to
my
own
“beast
machine”
theory
.


For
these
theories
,
the
idea
is
that
by
progressively
accounting
for
diverse
aspects
of
consciousness
,
they
can
ultimately
shift
from
being
theories
for
consciousness
science
towards
being
theories
of
consciousness
itself
.

Equity
and
good
conscience means
fairness
as
applied
to
a
given
set
of
circumstances
.


(2)
It
will
be
against
equity
and
good
conscience
to
deny
waiver
when
repayment
of
the
overpayment
would
deprive
you
of
income
required
to
provide
for
basic
necessities
including
food
,
shelter
,
medicine
,
utilities
,
and
related
expenses
.


Unless
there
are
unusual
circumstances
which
would
argue
against
waiver
,
the
department
will
presume
repayment
would
leave
you
unable
to
provide
basic
necessities
if
your
total
household
resources
in
relation
to
household
size
do
not
exceed
seventy
percent
of
the
Lower
Living
Standard
Income
Level
(LLSIL)
and
circumstances
are
not
expected
to
change
within
the
next
ninety
days
.


(3)
The
department
may
also
consider
,
but
is
not
limited
to
,
the
following
factors
in
determining
whether
waiver
should
be
granted
for
reasons
of
equity
and
good
conscience
:
(a)
Your
general
health
,
including
disability
,
competency
,
and
mental
or
physical
impairment
;
(b)
Your
education
level
,
including
literacy
;
(c)
Whether
you
are
currently
employed
and
your
history
of
unemployment
;
(d)
Your
future
earnings
potential
based
on
your
occupation
,
skills
,
and
the
local
labor
market
;
(e)
Your
marital
status
and
number
of
dependents
,
including
whether
other
household
members
are
employed
;
(f)
Whether
an
error
by
department
staff
contributed
to
the
overpayment
;
(g)
Whether
you
refused
or
were
ineligible
for
other
government
benefits
because
you
received
unemployment
benefits
;
and
(h)
Other
factors
indicating
that
repayment
of
the
full
amount
would
cause
you
undue
economic
,
physical
,
or
mental
hardship
.


(4)
When
determining
whether
a
waiver
of
benefit
overpayments
may
be
granted
based
on
equity
and
good
conscience
,
the
department
must
consider
whether
the
employer
or
employer
'
s
agent
failed
to
respond
timely
or
adequately
without
good
cause
to
the
department
'
s
written
request
for
claim
information
.


This
subsection
does
not
apply
to
negotiated
settlements
.


(5)
The
decision
to
grant
or
deny
waiver
will
be
based
on
the
totality
of
circumstances
rather
than
the
presence
of
a
single
factor
listed
in
subsections
(2)
,
(3)
,
and

Eating
with
a
Conscience

[choose
a
crop]Choosing
organic
food
to
protect
health
and
the
environment

Our
food
choices
have
a
direct
effect
on
the
health
of
our
environment
and
those
who
grow
and
harvest
what
we
eat
.

 
That’s
why
food
labeled
"organic"
is
the
right
choice
.


In
addition
to
serious
health
questions
linked
to
actual
residues
of
toxic
pesticides
on
the
food
we
eat
,
our
food
buying
decisions
support
or
reject
hazardous
agricultural
practices
,
protection
of
farmworkers
and
farm
families
,
and
stewardship
of
the
earth
.



The
Organic
Choice
is
Clear

It
is
important
to
eat
organic
food—nurtured
in
a
system
of
food
production
,
handling
and
certification
that
rejects
hazardous
synthetic
chemicals
.


USDA
organic
certification
is
the
only
system
of
food
labeling
that
is
subject
to
independent
public
review
and
oversight
,
assuring
consumers
that
toxic
,
synthetic
pesticides
used
in
conventional
agriculture
are
replaced
by
management
practices
focused
on
soil
biology
,
biodiversity
,
and
plant
health
.


This
eliminates
commonly
used
toxic
chemicals
in
the
production
and
processing
of
food
that
is
not
labeled
organic--pesticides
that
contaminate
our
water
and
air
,
hurt
biodiversity
,
harm
farmworkers
,
and
kill
bees
,
birds
,
fish
and
other
wildlife
.



Food
Choices
Based
Only
on
Pesticide
Residues
Fall
Short

To
help
explain
the
urgent
need
for
a
major
shift
to
organic
food
consumption
,
Beyond
Pesticides
has
begun
the
Eating
with
a
Conscience
database
which
evaluates
the
impacts
on
the
environment
and
farmworkers
of
the
toxic
chemicals
allowed
for
use
on
major
food
crops
,
grown
domestically
and
internationally
.


We
have
started
with
those
foods
that
have
been
identified
widely
in
the
media
as
“clean
.

”
While
the
Clean
15
and
Dirty
Dozen
lists
generated
by
Environmental
Working
Group
is
helpful
in
alerting
consumers
to
hazardous
residues
on
food
,
food
residues
are
only
part
of
the
story
.

 It
turns
out
that
those
very
same
“clean”
food
commodities
may
be
grown
with
hazardous
pesticides
that
get
into
waterways
and
groundwater
,
contaminate
nearby
communities
,
poison
farmworkers
,
and
kill
wildlife
,
while
not
all
showing
up
at
detectable
levels
on
our
food
.



Choosing
Organic
:
For
you
,
the
environment
,
and
workers

Eating
with
a
Conscience
looks
at
the
toxic
chemicals
that
are
allowed
in
the
production
of
the
food
we
eat
and
the
environmental
and
public
health
effects
resulting
from
their
use
.



Choose
a
fruit
or
vegetable
.
