guilty
consciencebad
conscience
guilt
or
guilty
conscience
is
one
of
the
most
common
negative
or
sad
emotions
that
people
experience
almost
every
day
if
not
addressed
properly
a
guilty
conscience
can
destroy
your
relationship
steal
your
joy
your
happiness
and
even
your
future
yet
the
majority
of
us
don
t
know
how
to
deal
with
it
in
a
healthy
way
according
to
the
german
philosopher
friedrich
nietzsche
1844
1900
a
guilty
conscience
can
push
a
person
to
become
very
cruel
and
do
horrible
things
as
a
result
horrible
things
like
killing
committing
suicide
etc
yet
just
like
any
other
emotions
there
s
not
a
clear
definition
for
a
guilty
conscience
so
to
better
understand
what
it
is
one
has
to
explore
the
concept
of
right
and
wrong
within
society
in
psychology
for
sigmund
freud
guilt
resides
under
the
surface
veneer
of
a
person
s
behavior
1856
1939
with
that
says
guilt
is
a
selfconscious
emotion
that
signals
a
person
when
hisher
actions
or
behaviors
may
have
caused
or
will
cause
harm
to
others
either
physically
emotionally
or
both
so
to
feel
guilty
is
to
feel
painful
regret
for
something
wrong
one
thinks
heshe
might
have
done
why
feeling
guilty
is
important
last
week
i
wrote
about
psychological
deflection
and
the
major
role
our
ego
plays
in
it
in
that
article
i
said
that
our
ego
builds
a
selfdefense
system
designed
to
protect
us
from
feeling
guilty
or
remorseful
for
our
bad
behaviors
or
actions
in
order
to
keep
our
selfesteem
selfworth
etc
intact
i
further
said
that
over
time
that
same
selfdefense
system
will
start
having
negative
effects
on
our
selfimage
and
the
way
we
view
the
world
this
means
no
one
can
buy
himselfherself
a
getoutjailfree
card
in
this
universe
to
maintain
emotional
and
psychological
balance
it
is
necessary
to
experience
guilt
for
our
bad
behavior
or
actions
besides
a
guilty
conscience
is
like
having
a
snooze
alarm
in
your
head
that
won
t
shut
off
until
it
is
addressed
and
it
has
to
be
addressed
in
a
healthy
way
if
not
addressed
properly
a
guilty
conscience
will
make
it
very
hard
for
you
to
think
straight
and
make
the
right
decisions
when
necessary
a
guilty
conscience
can
also
trigger
shame
anger
emptiness
and
in
many
cases
sabotage
your
entire
life
and
your
relationship
with
others
a
guilty
conscience
that
is
not
addressed
properly
will
also
make
you
become
very
paranoid
and
delusional
for
example
a
guilty
conscience
may
make
you
feel
that
everything
people
say
or
write
in
their
social
media
pages
is
about
you
and
then
consider
it
as
a
personal
attack
against
therefore
you
feel
the
urgency
to
respond
to
them
defensively
such
behavior
will
eventually
throw
you
off
balance
emotionally
and
psychologically
and
make
you
a
good
candidate
for
anxiety
depression
or
much
worse
a
guilty
conscience
can
also
make
you
hate
and
punish
yourself
avoid
hearing
nor
seeing
the
person
that
you
ve
wronged
it
will
also
push
you
to
talk
negatively
about
that
person
in
order
to
justify
your
bad
behavior
or
actions
and
in
many
cases
it
can
even
make
you
feel
resentful
towards
himher
because
every
time
you
hear
or
see
himher
it
reminds
you
what
you
have
done
guilt
can
also
make
you
hate
that
person
you
ve
wronged
and
try
to
do
more
harm
to
himher
should
you
get
the
opportunity
how
to
effectively
deal
with
a
guilty
conscience
1
the
first
step
in
dealing
with
a
guilty
conscience
is
always
to
surrender
to
the
truth
repentance
this
means
to
stop
fighting
or
denying
your
guilt
because
the
more
you
deny
it
the
more
intense
the
pain
will
become
never
deny
your
guilt
nor
try
to
blame
it
on
someone
else
because
as
i
ve
said
before
no
one
can
buy
himselfherself
a
getoutjailfree
card
in
this
universe
this
means
denying
your
guilt
will
have
other
effects
2
the
second
step
is
to
stop
punishing
yourself
understand
that
no
one
is
perfect
including
you
which
leaves
the
avenue
of
life
wide
open
before
you
to
make
plenty
of
mistakes
so
own
your
mistakes
and
learn
from
them
if
you
re
in
an
environment
where
you
feel
like
you
re
constantly
being
judged
remove
yourself
from
that
environment
as
soon
as
you
can
3
the
third
step
in
dealing
with
a
guilty
conscience
is
to
keep
your
emotions
and
behavior
in
check
at
all
time
there
s
nothing
more
embarrassing
for
a
person
than
not
being
unable
to
control
hisher
emotions
or
behavior
such
a
person
can
easily
snap
at
others
for
no
justifiable
reason
s
and
it
does
not
look
good
at
all
4
the
fourth
step
is
forgiveness
and
this
is
very
very
important
through
my
personal
and
professional
experience
i
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
hardest
part
of
forgiveness
is
not
forgiving
someone
who
ve
wronged
you
it
is
forgiving
ourselves
in
other
words
selfforgiveness
but
here
s
the
thing
to
take
that
pressure
off
your
back
to
enjoy
life
once
again
to
build
high
selfesteem
and
confidence
in
oneself
selfforgiveness
is
vital
so
seek
forgiveness
from
the
person
you
ve
wronged
forgive
yourself
and
then
let
it
go
5
the
fifth
step
is
to
focus
on
the
now
rather
than
the
past
i
often
hear
people
said
to
others
that
they
can
t
live
in
the
past
or
repeat
the
past
whenever
i
hear
that
i
smile
because
it
s
easier
said
than
done
in
fact
the
majority
of
us
are
actually
living
in
the
past
emotionally
and
psychologically
and
the
sad
thing
is
they
re
not
even
aware
of
it
if
you
don
t
own
your
past
in
other
words
take
responsibility
and
be
mindful
about
it
i
can
tell
you
right
now
that
your
life
is
on
a
repeat
mode
and
there
s
not
much
difference
between
your
past
and
your
current
situation
this
means
your
past
keeps
repeating
itself
in
your
present
and
if
you
don
t
change
your
way
of
doing
things
it
will
repeat
itself
in
your
future
also
6
the
sixth
and
final
step
is
to
always
seek
professional
help
psychologist
if
feel
like
you
re
overwhelmed
by
a
guilty
conscience
because
it
can
lead
to
more
severe
emotional
or
psychological
situations
even
suicide

introduction
in
this
essay
i
explore
adam
smith
s
analysis
of
the
origins
of
conscience
and
general
moral
rules
in
the
theory
of
moral
sentiments
i
argue
that
adam
smith
offers
a
distinction
between
moral
conscience
and
general
moral
rules
that
sidesteps
the
traditional
distinction
between
universal
and
relative
moral
standards
leading
to
a
fundamental
rethinking
of
the
problem
of
the
variability
of
moral
opinion
and
the
demands
of
moral
conscience
and
duty
moral
conscience
like
the
thought
of
his
mentor
francis
hutcheson
and
of
his
friend
david
hume
smith
s
moral
theory
is
rooted
in
an
analysis
of
the
workings
of
our
moral
sentiments
in
its
barest
form
smith
s
argument
is
that
we
judge
others
when
we
use
our
imaginations
to
put
ourselves
into
their
situation
and
bring
their
case
home
to
us
1
either
we
do
or
do
not
sympathize
with
the
sentiments
and
motives
guiding
the
actions
of
the
person
we
are
observing
when
the
sentiments
sparked
in
the
spectator
are
congruent
with
those
found
in
the
agent
we
approve
of
another
s
actions
or
character
as
being
appropriate
2
when
they
do
not
we
condemn
them
as
inappropriate
moral
judgment
thus
arises
from
how
we
feel
about
a
particular
situation
that
we
as
spectators
are
observing
in
order
to
correct
for
any
biases
that
might
intrude
into
our
moral
judgment
from
either
our
interests
or
our
passions
smith
argues
that
we
must
assume
the
socalled
“
impartial
spectator
”
position
for
viewing
others
actions
and
motives
3
our
senses
of
propriety
and
impropriety
as
well
as
of
merit
and
demerit
follow
from
our
observations
and
judgments
as
spectators
of
ourselves
and
other
people
with
the
adoption
of
an
impartial
spectator
position
to
correct
for
any
bias
in
our
judgments
smith
s
notion
of
moral
conscience
follows
directly
from
this
general
approach
he
believes
we
cultivate
a
moral
conscience
by
learning
to
view
ourselves
our
intentions
and
our
actions
from
a
position
of
impartial
spectatorship
from
this
position
we
cultivate
a
concern
with
praiseworthiness
and
blameworthiness
not
praise
and
blame
being
virtuous
and
having
a
fully
developed
moral
conscience
for
smith
represents
the
highest
stage
in
the
moral
development
of
an
individual
general
rules
and
duty
early
in
the
theory
of
moral
sentiments
smith
appears
to
be
confident
in
our
ability
to
form
moral
judgments
a
more
cautious
attitude
emerges
at
the
beginning
of
chapter
four
of
part
iii
of
the
theory
of
moral
sentiments
the
impartial
spectator
it
seems
is
no
longer
enough
to
help
individuals
make
moral
judgments
in
the
real
world
4
smith
begins
the
chapter
by
noting
that
the
impartial
spectator
has
its
limitations
in
the
world
of
action
we
may
try
to
view
our
own
conduct
from
the
perspective
of
the
impartial
spectator
both
before
and
after
we
do
something
but
our
passions
and
emotions
can
affect
the
way
we
examine
ourselves
and
often
lead
us
to
mistaken
judgments
in
both
circumstances
in
general
it
is
easier
to
resist
this
partiality
after
the
fact
when
our
passions
and
emotions
have
subsided
and
no
longer
dominate
our
moral
perception
of
the
world
our
ability
to
resist
the
partiality
of
the
passions
before
an
action
is
more
problematic
we
may
want
something
so
badly
that
we
are
unable
to
make
a
good
decision
about
what
should
be
done
our
passions
want
what
they
want
and
there
may
be
nothing
that
we
can
do
about
it
5
smith
labels
this
partiality
brought
into
moral
judgment
by
the
passions
and
emotion
“
selfdeceit
”
and
claims
that
it
the
“
fatal
weakness
of
mankind
”
“
the
source
of
half
the
disorders
of
human
life
”
tms
158
the
solution
that
“
nature
”
appears
to
have
devised
to
the
problem
of
selfdeceit
comes
in
the
form
of
general
rules
concerning
what
is
fit
and
proper
to
do
and
what
must
be
avoided
the
psychological
source
of
these
general
rules
that
we
use
to
guide
our
judgments
about
ourselves
is
surprising
they
do
not
arise
from
our
observations
of
our
own
behavior
but
from
our
observations
of
the
behavior
of
others
as
smith
explains
“
our
continual
observations
upon
the
conduct
of
others
insensibly
lead
us
to
form
to
ourselves
certain
general
rules
concerning
what
is
fit
and
proper
either
to
be
done
or
to
be
avoided
”
tms
159
the
specific
mechanism
by
which
these
rules
are
formed
is
considerably
different
from
the
cultivation
of
conscience
take
the
emergence
of
negative
rules
or
commands
that
order
us
not
to
do
something
we
observe
another
s
behavior
and
disapprove
of
it
we
hear
others
express
similar
sentiments
and
this
confirms
and
reinforces
our
earlier
judgment
we
resolve
never
to
be
guilty
of
similar
actions
and
exposed
to
similar
disapprobation
“
we
thus
naturally
lay
down
to
ourselves
a
general
rule
that
all
such
actions
are
to
be
avoided
as
tending
to
render
us
odious
contemptible
or
punishable
the
objects
of
all
those
sentiments
for
which
we
have
the
greatest
dread
and
aversion
”
tms
159
in
other
words
general
moral
rules
are
formed
out
of
our
judgments
of
particular
experiences
that
we
observe
in
conjunction
with
the
judgments
of
others
a
desire
for
praise
or
an
aversion
to
blame
not
the
moral
conscience
s
concern
for
praiseworthiness
or
aversion
to
blameworthiness
compels
us
to
develop
them
after
these
general
rules
are
formed
and
“
universally
acknowledged
and
established
by
the
concurring
sentiments
of
mankind
”
they
are
seen
to
be
standards
of
judgment
for
evaluating
other
events
in
the
world
tms
160
this
view
of
the
origins
of
general
moral
rules
carries
four
important
consequences
first
it
explains
the
tools
available
to
individuals
for
escaping
the
limitations
of
the
moral
sentiments
when
judging
oneself
rather
than
trying
to
control
or
curtail
one
s
passions
and
emotions
an
individual
can
use
general
rules
through
“
habitual
reflection
”
as
a
way
to
escape
the
misrepresentations
of
selflove
and
other
passions
the
rules
are
standards
against
which
we
can
judge
our
actions
before
the
fact
and
decide
if
they
are
appropriate
behavior
or
not
second
this
view
helps
account
for
the
enormous
variability
in
moral
rules
across
different
cultures
and
historical
periods
there
is
no
guarantee
that
different
societies
will
adopt
the
same
general
rules
for
overcoming
the
limitations
of
moral
judgment
in
real
individuals
third
this
account
helps
explain
how
moral
rules
themselves
can
become
the
objects
of
moral
judgments
individuals
come
to
approve
of
general
rules
as
being
a
good
thing
for
society
to
the
point
that
they
may
believe
that
they
have
a
foundation
independent
of
our
moral
sentiments
history
is
replete
with
examples
of
peoples
claiming
their
rules
were
given
to
them
by
divine
authority
our
natural
sense
of
duty
may
be
reinforced
by
a
mistaken
notion
of
the
universality
of
the
moral
standards
that
have
emerged
in
the
society
in
which
we
live
finally
this
view
explains
how
tensions
arise
when
the
judgments
of
our
moral
conscience
might
be
displaced
or
at
least
come
into
conflict
with
the
general
rules
that
are
established
in
a
particular
society
and
to
which
we
feel
deep
sentimental
attachments
in
smith
s
world
there
is
no
guarantee
that
the
conclusions
of
our
sense
of
moral
conscience
will
dovetail
neatly
into
our
sense
of
duty
the
sense
of
duty
smith
s
conclusions
about
the
difference
between
the
dictates
of
moral
conscience
and
our
sense
of
duty
to
obey
general
rules
are
profound
virtuous
individuals
guided
by
moral
conscience
cultivate
the
feelings
that
are
appropriate
to
particular
situations
for
example
when
confronted
with
the
benevolent
behavior
of
another
they
feel
gratitude
towards
that
person
and
act
appropriately
a
person
educated
to
one
s
duty
may
never
feel
the
appropriate
sentiment
of
gratitude
but
they
may
learn
to
act
appropriately
based
on
their
regard
for
the
rules
of
gratitude
established
in
their
society
“
the
motive
of
his
actions
”
smith
explains
“
may
be
no
other
than
a
reverence
for
the
established
rule
of
duty
as
serious
and
earnest
desire
of
acting
in
every
respect
according
to
the
law
of
gratitude

a
regard
for
the
general
rules
of
society
may
be
a
secondbest
option
for
human
beings
trying
to
live
together
with
one
another
acting
from
a
sense
of
duty
may
not
point
one
to
the
most
complete
perfection
of
one
s
moral
character
but
it
does
give
rise
to
a
society
where
individuals
can
treat
one
another
with
a
“
tolerable
decency
”
and
for
most
of
one
s
life
be
able
“
to
avoid
any
considerable
degree
of
blame
”
tms
163
more
to
the
point
our
sense
of
duty
may
be
more
important
than
our
sentiments
for
virtue
“

general

the
tension
between
conscience
and
duty
for
smith
humans
are
subject
to
multiple
commands
in
ethics
some
stemming
from
the
dictates
of
conscience
and
others
from
duty
when
should
the
principle
of
duty
be
the
sole
principle
regulating
our
conduct
in
the
world
and
when
should
it
concur
with
other
motives
such
as
those
provided
by
moral
conscience
conscience
and
duty
introduce
tension
into
smith
s
understanding
of
moral
judgement
and
action
in
the
theory
of
moral
sentiments
understanding
that
tension
between
the
demands
of
conscience
and
duty
lies
at
the
heart
of
the
final
chapter
of
part
vi
some
moral
judgements
are
guided
primarily
by
moral
conscience
others
are
guided
by
general
rules
and
our
sense
of
duty
given
the
characteristics
of
a
particular
passion
individuals
may
face
a
difficult
task
of
balancing
between
the
demands
of
conscience
and
of
duty
for
example
regarding
benevolent
and
social
sentiments
like
love
our
moral
judgements
and
actions
flow
naturally
from
our
benevolent
sentiments
our
sense
of
duty
can
be
employed
to
watch
over
and
moderate
excessive
benevolence
on
the
whole
the
benevolent
side
of
our
moral
character
can
be
trusted
to
work
appropriately
with
regard
to
malevolent
and
unsocial
passions
such
as
resentment
and
anger
however
moral
judgement
and
action
should
proceed
entirely
from
a
sense
of
duty
the
passions
themselves
being
too
dangerous
to
allow
unlimited
play
as
a
motive
to
our
actions
selfish
passions
are
even
more
complicated
our
ordinary
private
interest
ought
to
flow
from
a
regard
to
the
general
rules
not
from
the
objects
themselves
but
another
quite
different
conclusion
is
reached
regarding
the
“
extraordinary
and
important
objects
of
selfinterest
”
involving
advancement
and
social
recognition
tms
173
humans
recognize
that
the
actions
of
a
prince
in
war
a
member
of
parliament
seeking
reelection
or
a
tradesman
seeking
a
special
job
must
be
grounded
at
least
in
part
by
the
passion
of
ambition
and
not
just
duty
or
conscience
for
successful
advancement
and
social
recognition
a
second
issue
that
follows
from
the
distinction
between
conscience
and
duty
involves
the
precision
and
exactness
of
the
general
moral
rules
themselves
some
rules
are
clearer
and
more
important
to
society
than
others
for
example
smith
argues
that
the
rules
of
such
virtues
as
prudence
charity
generosity
gratitude
and
friendship
“
are
in
many
respects
loose
and
inaccurate
admit
of
many
exceptions
and
require
so
many
modifications
that
it
is
scarce
possible
to
regulate
our
conduct
entirely
by
a
regard
for
them
”
tms
174
in
contrast
the
rules
of
justice
are
accurate
to
the
highest
degree
and
admit
of
no
exceptions
6
when
we
practice
the
former
virtue
sentiment
should
be
allowed
to
predominate
rather
than
a
specific
regard
for
any
particular
rule
“
but
it
is
otherwise
with
regard
to
justice
the
man
who
in
that
refines
the
least
and
adheres
with
the
most
obstinate
stedfastness
to
the
general
rules
themselves
is
the
most
commendable
and
the
most
to
be
depended
on
”
tms
175
given
its
importance
to
human
society
it
is
not
surprising
that
smith
sees
other
sentiments
in
our
nature
bolstering
our
sense
of
duty
particularly
the
religious
sentiment
even
in
its
crudest
form
“
during
the
ignorance
and
darkness
of
pagan
superstition
”
religion
gave
support
to
the
rules
of
morality
people
believed
that
the
gods
could
be
appealed
to
in
order
to
reward
the
good
and
punish
the
bad
similarly
our
natural
sense
of
religion
supports
our
natural
sense
of
duty
by
convincing
us
that
the
general
rules
of
morality
“
are
to
be
regarded
as
the
commands
and
laws
of
the
deity
promulgated
by
those
vicegerents
which
he
has
thus
set
up
within
us
”
tms
165
there
is
a
darker
side
to
religion
s
place
in
our
moral
life
religion
may
complement
the
teaching
of
our
natural
sentiments
and
reinforce
the
importance
of
our
sense
of
duty
false
religion
may
pervert
our
natural
sentiments
and
distort
our
notions
of
duty
beyond
recognition
tms
176
the
linkage
drawn
by
smith
between
the
general
rules
of
morality
and
“
the
commands
and
laws
of
the
deity
”
is
one
of
the
most
confusing
in
the
theory
of
moral
sentiments
and
remains
prone
to
misinterpretation
one
might
easily
argue
that
what
smith
means
to
say
is
that
the
conclusions
of
conscience
are
the
general
laws
of
morality
backed
by
our
religious
sentiment
from
this
interpretation
conscience
can
easily
be
identified
as
“
vicegerents
of
god
”
that
reward
us
for
following
the
law
and
punish
us
for
breaking
it
if
my
reading
of
the
sharp
distinction
between
duty
and
conscience
is
correct
this
reading
is
seriously
mistaken
as
i
argue
above
our
general
rules
of
morality
are
generalizations
based
upon
our
observations
of
our
moral
judgments
in
conjunction
with
those
of
others
they
are
not
conclusions
of
our
moral
conscience
conscience
deals
with
the
problem
of
praiseworthiness
duty
centers
upon
the
problem
of
praise
all
people
have
the
capacity
for
moral
generalization
all
people
do
not
have
a
highly
functioning
moral
sense
of
conscience
the
“
vicegerents
of
god
”
that
smith
is
referring
to
are
not
just
the
sentiments
involved
with
conscience
they
encompass
all
our
moral
faculties
including
our
sense
of
propriety
and
impropriety
our
sense
of
merit
and
demerit
and
our
sense
of
duty
the
significance
of
the
distinction
between
conscience
and
duty
in
smith
s
thought
is
revealed
most
clearly
at
the
end
of
chapter
v
in
part
iii
smith
emphasizes
that
while
he
wants
to
distinguish
between
duty
and
conscience
he
does
not
want
to
say
they
are
necessarily
antithetical
to
one
another
on
the
contrary
for
the
most
part
they
complement
one
another
he
comments
that
“
the
general
rules
by
which
external
prosperity
and
adversity
are
commonly
distributed
in
this
life
”
tend
to
encourage
and
promote
virtue
prudence
is
rewarded
with
success
in
business
humanity
is
rewarded
in
our
private
lives
with
love
but
there
are
times
when
some
of
our
natural
sentiments
fly
in
the
face
of
general
rules
by
which
society
is
governed
smith
explains
the
industrious
knave
cultivates
the
soil
the
indolent
good
man
leaves
it
uncultivated
who
ought
to
reap
the
harvest
who
starve
and
who
live
in
plenty
the
natural
course
of
things
decides
in
favour
of
the
knave
the
natural
sentiments
of
mankind
in
favour
of
the
man
of
virtue
tms
168
from
the
perspective
of
duty
the
rules
governing
marketplace
activity
that
is
property
rights
and
the
like
generally
result
in
socially
beneficial
outcomes
the
fact
that
wealth
goes
to
the
industrious
knave
rather
than
the
lazy
or
indolent
good
man
is
acceptable
to
our
sense
of
justice
but
from
the
perspective
of
our
other
sentiments
that
tell
us
that
goodness
should
be
rewarded
another
conclusion
is
sometimes
reached
the
efforts
made
by
societies
to
redirect
the
natural
distribution
of
wealth
often
reflect
the
conflicting
demands
that
our
sentiments
make
up
the
world
sometimes
these
demands
are
misconceived
as
smith
notes
the
natural
course
of
things
cannot
be
entirely
controlled
by
the
impotent
endeavors
of
man
the
current
is
too
rapid
and
too
strong
for
him
to
stop
it
and
though
the
rules
of
which
direct
it
appear
to
have
been
established
for
the
wisest
and
best
purpose
they
sometimes
produce
effects
which
shock
all
his
natural
sentiments
tms
168
there
are
natural
limits
to
what
we
can
do
to
impose
the
teaching
of
our
consciences
upon
the
world
but
that
does
not
mean
that
we
must
deny
our
consciences
out
of

indignation
in
the
face
of
perceived
unfairness
is
a
natural
response

our
conscience

sparked
considerable
controversy

secondary
literature

at
the
heart
of
smith
s
rejection
of
francis
hutcheson
s
theory
of
moral
sense
essentially
smith
s
argument
is
that
if
we

we
would
be
able
to
judge
our
own
actions

better
than
we

it
bears

conscience
is
a
judgment
of
reason
whereby
the
human
person
recognizes
the
moral
quality
of
a
concrete
act
that
he
is
going
to
perform
is
in
the
process
of
performing
or
has
already
completed
in
all
he
says
and
does
man
is
obliged
to
follow
faithfully
what
he
knows
to
be
just
and
right
it
is
by
the
judgment
of
his
conscience
that
man
perceives
and
recognizes
the
prescriptions
of
the
divine
law
conscience
is
a
law
of
the
mind
yet
christians
would
not
grant
that
it
is
nothing
more
i
mean
that
it
was
not
a
dictate
nor
conveyed
the
notion
of
responsibility
of
duty
of
a
threat
and
a
promise
conscience
is
a
messenger
of
him
who
both
in
nature
and
in
grace
speaks
to
us
behind
a
veil
and
teaches
and
rules
us

his
representatives

it
is
important
for
every
person
to
be
sufficiently
present
to
himself
in
order
to
hear
and
follow
the
voice
of
his
conscience
this
requirement
of
interiority
is
all
the
more
necessary
as
life
often
distracts
us
from
any
reflection
selfexamination
or
introspection
return

your
conscience

the
dignity
of
the
human
person
implies
and
requires
uprightness
of
moral
conscience
conscience
includes
the
perception
of
the
principles
of
morality
synderesis
their
application
in
the
given
circumstances
by
practical
discernment
of
reasons
and
goods
and
finally
judgment
about
concrete
acts
yet
to
be
performed
or
already
performed
the
truth
about
the
moral
good
stated
in
the
law
of
reason
is
recognized
practically
and
concretely
by
the
prudent
judgment
of
conscience
we
call
that
man
prudent
who
chooses
in
conformity
with
this
judgment
1781
conscience
enables
one
to
assume
responsibility
for
the
acts
performed
if
man
commits
evil
the
just
judgment
of
conscience
can
remain
within
him
as
the
witness
to
the
universal
truth
of
the
good
at
the
same
time
as
the
evil
of
his
particular
choice
the
verdict
of
the
judgment
of
conscience
remains
a
pledge
of
hope
and
mercy
in
attesting
to
the
fault
committed
it
calls
to
mind
the
forgiveness
that
must
be
asked
the
good
that
must
still
be
practiced
and
the
virtue
that
must
be
constantly
cultivated
with
the
grace
of
god
we
shall
reassure
our
hearts

has
the
right
to
act

in

he

how
to

a
moral

what
is
a
moral
conscience
 
 
according
to
the
catechism
of
the
catholic
church
a
human
person
“
has
in
his
heart
a
law
inscribed
by
god
”
“
calling
him
to
love
”
 
this
is
a
person
s
moral
conscience
1776
 
 
in
their
document
forming
consciences
for
faithful
citizenship
the
u
s
bishops
said
conscience
is
not
something
that
allows
us
to
justify
doing
whatever
we
want
nor
is
it
a
mere
feeling
about
what
we
should
or
should
not
do
rather
conscience
is
the
voice
of
god
resounding
in
the
human
heart
revealing
the
truth
to
us
and
calling
us
to
do
what
is
good
while
shunning
what
is
evil
”
 
 
the
moral
conscience
urges
a
person
 
“
to
do
good
and
avoid
evil
”
it
also
judges
particular
choices
approving
those
which
are
good
and
disapproving
those
which
are
evil
catechism
of
the
catholic
church
1777
 
our
conscience
enables
us
to
understand
the
principles
of
morality
decide
how
to
apply
those
principles
in
specific
circumstances
and
judge
the
moral
status
of
concrete
acts
1780
 
 
the
human
person
has
the
right
to
act
in
conscience
and
in
freedom
and
“
must
always
obey
the
certain
judgment
of
his
conscience
”
1782
1790
 
 
the
catechism
says
a
person
s
moral
conscience
 
must
be
informed
and
enlightened
so
that
it
“
formulates
its
judgments
according
to
reason
and
in
conformity
with
the
true
good
willed
by
god
1783
 
shaping
a
wellformed
conscience
is
a
lifelong
task
which
is
rooted
in
the
word
of
god
assisted
by
the
gifts
of
the
holy
spirit
aided
by
the
witness
or
advice
of
others
and
guided
by
the
authoritative
teaching
of
the
church
17841785
 
 
ignorance
of
christ
and
his
gospel
bad
example
by
others
enslavement
to
one
s
passions
a
mistaken
notion
of
autonomy
rejection
of
the
church
s
authority
or
teaching
lack
of
conversion
or
charity
may
all
be
a
source
of
errors
in
moral
judgment
 
one
must
therefore
work
to
correct
the
errors
of
moral
conscience
1792
1793
 
 
the
catechism
says
that
individuals
are
 
“
sometimes
confronted
by
situations
that
make
moral
judgments
less
assured
and
decision
difficult
”
 
in
such
situations
a
person
“
must
always
seriously
seek
what
is
right
and
good
and
discern
the
will
of
god
expressed
in
divine
law
”
1787
 
in
this
effort
a
person
“
strives
to
interpret
the
data
of
experience
and
the
signs
of
the
times
”
with
the
assistance
of
“
the
virtue
of
prudence
the
advice
of
competent
people
and
the
help
of
the
holy
spirit
”

how
to
form
a
moral
conscience
here
are
some
guidelines
for
how
to
form
a
moral
conscience
particularly
in
a
situation
where
you
may
misunderstand
or
disagree
with
a
specific
truth
or
teaching
of
the
church
•
consult
 
with
a
pastor
pastoral
staff
member
or
spiritual
guide
who
understands
and
can
explain
the
church
s
teaching
clearly
and
correctly
 
identify
the
fundamental
truths
or
values
on
which
this
teaching
is
based
and
determine
how
essential
this
teaching
is
to
the
core
of
catholic
faith
beware
of
making
decisions
based
on
information
you
read
in
books
or
online
which
may
not
accurately
explain
the
church
s
teaching
•
assume
that
the
church
s
understanding
of
god
s
revelation
and
human
nature
is
fuller
deeper
and
more
reliable
than
any
individual
s
even
though
the
church
s
teaching
may
seem
ideal
unrealistic
or
wrong
to
you
start
from
the
assumption
that
it
is
correct
and
applies
to
your
personal
circumstances
 
 
•
evaluate
your
personal
opinions
feelings
and
circumstances
carefully
 
honestly
assess
the
reasons
why
you
are
unable
or
unwilling
to
agree
or
comply
with
the
church
s
teaching
 
this
is
best
done
with
the
assistance
of
an
trusted
companion
such
as
a
pastor
confessor
or
spiritual
guide
who
understands
the
church
s
teaching
as
well
as
your
personal
circumstances
•
pray
for
the
grace
to
understand
and
appreciate
the
underlying
truth
or
values
which
are
reflected
in
the
church
s
teaching
and
for
the
grace
to
discern
what
is
possible
for
you
in
your
particular
circumstances
be
patient
and
allow
time
for
god
s
inspiration
to
guide
you
directly
or
through
others
who
know
and
love
you
•
consult
with
your
pastor
a
confessor
or
reliable
spiritual
guide
before
making
a
final
decision
 
the
goal
here
is
to
determine
to
what
extent
you
can
or
cannot
understand
or
follow
the
church
s
teaching
 
to
what
extent
is
it
possible
to
honor
the
teaching
in
part
 
to
what
extent
is
it
possible
to
honor
the
underlying
truth
or
value
which
is
reflected
in
the
teaching
•
continue
to
pray
for
the
grace
to
understand
or
comply
with
the
church
s
teaching
more
fully
in
spite
of
your
personal
circumstances
 
pray
for
the
grace
to
appreciate
and
honor
the
underlying
truth
or
value
reflected
in
a
particular
teaching
be
open
to
changing
your
decision
as
your
understanding
or
circumstances
change
•
consult
with
your
pastor
a
confessor
or
reliable
spiritual
guide
if
you
are
troubled
by
your
decision
•
remember
that
god
knows
you
are
an
imperfect
and
sinful
person
and
loves
you
nonetheless
 
trust
in
god
s
mercy
and
love
even
if
after
careful
discernment
your
decision
does
not
agree
with
the
church
s
teaching
if
we
decide
that
we
cannot
understand
or
comply
 
completely
with
the
church
s
teaching
we
should
avoid
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
the
church
must
be
wrong
 
although
at
times
prophetic
individuals
and
groups
within
the
church
come
to
different
conclusions
which
the
church
officially
accepts
at
a
later
date
most
of
us
are
not
prophets
if
we
are
led
by
a
morally
responsible
conscience
to
believe
or
act
in
a
way
which
is
contrary
to
what
the
church
teaches
at
the
present
time
we
should
continue
to
assume
that
the
church
is
correct
and
that
for
more
or
less
legitimate
reasons
i
am
unable
or
unwilling
to
agree
or
comply
 
we
should
continue
to
participate
as
fully
as
possible
in
the
sacramental
and
spiritual
life
of
the
catholic
church
being
careful
not
to
give
scandal
to
others
who
may
be
confused
by
our
belief
or
behavior
if
we
are
led
by
a
morally
responsible
conscience
to
believe
or
act
in
a
way
which
is
contrary
to
what
the
church
teaches
at
the
present
time
we
should
do
so
with
a
spirit
of
humility
and
respect
a
desire
to
remain
in
communion
with
the
catholic
faith
community
and
the
intention
to
believe
and
obey
as
fully
as
possible
in
what
the
church
believes
and
teaches
we
should
proceed
cautiously
and
with
patience
aware
of
our
own
limitations
and
sinfulness

what
does
a
leader
of
conscience
mean
it
begins
with
character
to
avoid
distorted
values
with
a
centered
focus
on
virtues
of
humanity
a
leader
of
conscience
engages
in
community
conversations
and
identifies
what
virtues
to
act
upon
in
the
choices
being
made
sparked
by
professor
richard
shell
s
new
book
the
conscience
code
i
explored
what
being
conscience
means
it
led
me
to
the
ethics
centre
a
nonprofit
in
sydney
australia
the
ethics
centre
defines
conscience
as
1
what
a
person
believes
is
right
and
2
how
a
person
decides
what
is
right
while
conscience
sounds
simple
it
quickly
gets
complicated
as
we
encounter
situations
in
which
variables
challenge
us
in
what
we
believe
and
what
we
decide
is
right
in
some
cases
our
conscientious
voice
gets
it
right
immediately
other
times
confusion
reigns
our
conscience
and
character
are
intimately
linked
our
character
builds
specific
values
and
those
values
become
engraved
in
our
souls
while
values
are
essential
they
have
become
distorted
resulting
in
dogmatic
views
without
any
clear
perspective
of
what
is
right
professor
shell
highlights
three
elements
of
character
they
are
1
must
have
moral
impulses
–
prompts
us
to
behave
well
and
resist
temptations
and
pressures
2
must
have
the
awareness
to
know
what
values
are
relevant
in
the
situation
you
face
3
must
bring
selfdiscipline
to
own
a
situation
and
act
on
your
values
–
even
when
costly
or
inconvenient
these
character
elements
resonate
however
they
still
rest
on
values
which
may
be
a
problem
today
rather
than
focus
on
values
we
need
to
raise
our
character
to
embrace
virtues
in
pulling
the
thread
on
virtues
another
center
came
to
the
forefront
the
markkula
center
for
applied
ethics
at
santa
clara
university
discusses
virtues
as
a
focus
on
the
full
development
of
humanity
virtues
are
attitudes
dispositions
or
character
traits
that
enable
us
to
be
and
to
act
in
ways
that
develop
this
potential
humanity
the
development
of
humanity
is
crucial
when
considering
our
conscience
and
how
we
decide
what
to
do
in
challenging
situations
another
significant
point
on
virtues
is
that
they
are
developed
through
learning
and
practice
a
community
component
is
embedded
for
me
this
means
that
we
should
and
must
have
conversations
about
what
virtues
are
essential
in
our
civic
and
business
discourse
it
is
a
higherlevel
conversation
which
leads
to
a
focus
beyond
our
selfinterests
connecting
conscience
to
character
and
virtues
is
imperative
too
often
lately
values
are
being
distorted
to
protect
a
power
base
rather
than
engaging
the
value
in
how
it
helps
humanity
making
a
switch
to
virtues
can
raise
the
leadership
standard
a
new
conscience
accountability
checklist
after
our
conscience
determines
an
approach
ask
what
virtue
supports
the
decision
with
the
selected
decision
ask
what
the
impact
on
humanity
will
be
if
you
have
not
explored
the
impacted
virtue
with
others
then
put
the
decision
aside
until
you
do
we
all
need
to
engage
in
conversations
about
virtues
and
begin
to
raise
the
standard
of
being
a
leader
of
conscience

good
monday
morning
and
thank
you
for
listening
today
we
begin
the
week
with
a
really
sharp
and
robust
question
from
a
listener
named
arnaldo
here
it
is
“
hello
tony
and
pastor
john
thank
you
for
your
labors
on
this
podcast
my
question
is
one
that
i
have
struggled
with
for
over
two
decades
now
it
s
this
how
can
i
live
with
a
good
conscience
the
apostle
paul
often
talks
about
the
conscience
and
how
specifically
a
good
conscience
is
something
he
always
lived
with
apparently
even
before
he
became
a
christian
acts
231
2416
we
also
see
that
a
good
conscience
is
a
qualification
for
christian
leaders
1
timothy
39
and
having
a
good
conscience
is
an
important
goal
of
the
christian
life
for
all
believers
1
timothy
15
19
“
when
i
read
the
way
paul
uses
the
word
conscience
in
these
contexts
it
seems
like
he
s
saying
it
means
to
be
presently
walking
in
obedience
to
everything
god
has
revealed
to
him
he
does
not
seem
to
mean
that
he
s
trusting
in
christ
s
blood
to
cover
over
his
indwelling
sin
i
believe
in
both
the
doctrine
of
indwelling
sin
and
of
progressive
sanctification
according
to
texts
like
proverbs
418
and
romans
721
–
23
god
is
always
revealing
to
me
new
areas
and
sometimes
old
areas
where
i
need
to
grow
in
holiness
these
are
very
real
sin
issues
that
i
can
t
simply
stop
doing
like
turning
off
a
light
switch
these
are
ones
in
which
i
am
engaged
in
a
longterm
ongoing
struggle
and
fight
so
i
pray
daily
for
forgiveness
according
to
1
john
18
–
10
and
matthew
612
“
all
this
means
that
i
literally
never
have
a
good
conscience
—
i
am
always
aware
of
important
ways
in
which
i
presently
need
to
repent
and
become
more
holy
so
if
a
good
conscience
is
a
basic
christian
issue
and
paul
always
had
one
yet
i
will
always
know
of
sin
areas
in
my
life
—
and
if
i
have
to
pray
daily
for
forgiveness
—
how
could
i
or
any
christian
for
that
matter
ever
attain
to
a
good
conscience
”
well
arnaldo
has
done
his
homework
he
laid
out
texts
in
that
question
as
i
hear
it
that
contain
all
the
pieces
i
ve
got
a
few
to
add
that
might
take
a
little
turn
wow
he
s
not
winging
it
here
in
asking
that
question
if
there
s
a
solution
and
i
do
believe
there
is
it
s
probably
found
inside
those
texts
that
he
was
just
commenting
on
but
maybe
drawing
some
inferences
from
them
that
were
not
necessarily
accurate
sin
that
dwells
within
i
feel
the
force
of
the
question
experientially
walking
in
a
good
conscience
is
not
easy
for
me
since
i
share
arnaldo
s
deep
awareness
of
my
ongoing
indwelling
sin
that
s
paul
s
term
in
romans
717
20
23
we
all
have
remaining
corruption
and
indwelling
sin
the
more
keenly
you
are
aware
of
that
the
more
you
will
feel
embattled
at
the
level
of
needing
a
good
conscience
“
the
whole
new
testament
does
assume
that
in
this
life
nobody
attains
sinless
perfection
”
i
get
it
i
mean
i
think
that
s
a
serious
question
the
whole
new
testament
does
assume
that
in
this
life
nobody
attains
sinless
perfection
we
need
to
just
settle
that
that
s
one
of
the
premises
nobody
attains
sinless
perfection
in
this
life
jesus
said
that
we
would
pray
“
forgive
us
our
debts
”
right
after
“
give
us
this
day
our
daily
bread
”
matthew
611
–
12
they
go
together
every
day
say
both
of
those
paul
said
“
not
that
i
have
already
attained
perfection
but
i
press
on
to
make
it
my
own
”
philippians
312
he
referred
to
the
sin
that
dwells
in
him
and
cried
out
in
dismay
“
who
will
deliver
me
from
this
body
of
death
”
romans
724
jesus
pointed
to
the
publican
who
said
“
god
be
merciful
to
me
a
sinner
”
over
against
the
pharisee
who
was
thanking
god
that
he
had
such
a
clear
conscience
—
and
he
said
that
the
one
who
cried
out
for
mercy
about
his
sin
went
down
to
his
house
justified
luke
1810
–
14
it
was
good
for
him
to
own
his
sinfulness
not
to
say
“
oh
it
doesn
t
exist
i
ve
got
a
clear
conscience
i
don
t
have
any
sin
to
repent
of
”
we
feel
the
force
now
i
think
1
john
1
is
not
only
especially
illuminating
but
gives
us
a
category
alongside
good
conscience
that
may
provide
the
solution
walking
in
the
light
here
s
my
reading
of
1
john
1
starting
with
verses
6
and
7
if
we
say
we
have
fellowship
with
god
while
we
walk
in
darkness
we
lie
and
do
not
practice
the
truth
but
if
we
walk
in
the
light
as
he
is
in
the
light
we
have
fellowship
with
one
another
and
the
blood
of
jesus
his
son
cleanses
us
from
all
sin
now
that
is
staggeringly
amazing
“
if
we
walk
in
the
light
the
blood
of
jesus
cleanses
us
”
wow
here
s
1
john
18
“
if
we
say
we
have
no
sin
we
deceive
ourselves
and
the
truth
is
not
in
us
”
now
he
s
reeling
it
back
in
and
saying
“
don
t
assume
that
when
i
say
walk
in
the
light
i
mean
sinlessness
”
first
john
19
–
10
says
“
if
we
confess
our
sins
he
is
faithful
and
just
to
forgive
us
our
sins
and
to
cleanse
us
from
all
unrighteousness
if
we
say
we
have
not
sinned
we
make
him
a
liar
and
his
word
is
not
in
us
”
now
what
s
amazing
about
this
passage
is
that
it
says
we
must
be
walking
in
the
light
for
the
blood
of
jesus
to
cleanse
us
from
our
sins
then
he
says
that
this
walking
in
the
light
doesn
t
mean
sinlessness
we
are
liars
if
we
say
it
does
then
he
explains
that
when
we
walk
in
the
light
we
see
clearly
enough
—
we
have
light
—
to
know
sin
to
see
sin
as
what
it
is
and
hate
it
and
confess
it
then
we
enjoy
ongoing
cleansing
and
forgiveness
“
a
good
conscience
is
virtually
the
same
as
walking
in
the
light
”
here
s
what
i
would
draw
from
this
if
i
use
the
category
of
conscience
to
explain
this
passage
a
good
conscience
is
virtually
the
same
as
walking
in
the
light
christians
should
be
able
to
say
“
i
m
walking
in
the
light
”
and
mean
it
and
mean
by
that
“
i
m
walking
in
a
good
conscience
”
which
means
i
don
t
think
we
should
equate
having
a
bad
conscience
with
having
indwelling
sin
now
that
may
be
the
most
important
thing
i
say
tony
let
me
say
it
again
i
m
inferring
from
what
i
ve
said
from
1
john
1
that
having
a
bad
conscience
is
not
the
same
as
having
indwelling
sin
they
re
not
the
same
our
clear
conscience
that
s
my
basic
answer
to
arnaldo
s
question
he
feels
that
as
long
as
he
is
aware
of
the
reality
of
indwelling
sin
as
in
romans
7
he
cannot
have
a
good
conscience
now
if
that
were
true
i
don
t
think
paul
could
ever
have
a
good
conscience
but
he
clearly
says
he
does
have
a
good
conscience
“
i
thank
god
whom
i
serve
as
did
my
ancestors
with
a
clear
conscience
”
2
timothy
13
he
expects
the
elders
of
the
church
to
do
the
same
“
they
must
hold
the
mystery
of
the
faith
with
a
clear
conscience
”
1
timothy
39
that
s
the
goal
for
all
christians
according
to
1
timothy
15
“
the
aim
of
our
charge
is
love
that
issues
from
a
pure
heart
and
a
good
conscience
and
a
sincere
faith
”
i
don
t
think
we
should
equate
a
good
conscience
with
sinless
perfection
in
this
life
nor
equate
a
bad
conscience
with
the
presence
of
indwelling
sin
or
remaining
corruption
rather
a
clear
or
a
good
conscience
is
like
walking
in
the
light
if
we
walk
in
the
light
as
he
is
in
the
light
we
have
fellowship
with
one
another
and
the
blood
of
jesus
his
son
cleanses
us
from
all
sin
if
we
say
we
have
no
sin
in
other
words
if
we
interpret
“
walking
in
the
light
”
as
“
sinless
perfection
”
we
deceive
ourselves
and
the
truth
is
not
in
us
if
we
confess
our
sins
he
is
faithful
and
just
to
forgive
us
our
sins
and
to
cleanse
us
from
all
unrighteousness
1

david
s
example
i
think
both
paul
and
john
inherited
this
concept
of
ongoing
indwelling
sin
that
nevertheless
coexists
with
a
good
conscience
from
the
psalms
in
the
old
testament
for
example
in
psalm
25
david
confesses
three
times
that
he
s
a
sinner
“
god
instructs
sinners

the

comes
to
an

in
verse
21
like
this
“
may
integrity

preserve
me
for
i
wait
for
you
”
in
david
s
mind
—
now
he
s
writing
under
god
s
inspiration
and
this
is
not
the
only
place
in
the
psalms
there
are
a
lot
of
psalms
that
distinguish
the
righteous
and
the
wicked
the
righteous
are
really
righteous
they
re
walking
in
the
light
they
have
a
good
conscience
in
david
s
mind
there
is
an
integrity
and
an
uprightness
that
is
aware
of
indwelling
corruption
that
breaks
out
at
times
in
sins
it
does
and
that
ongoing
reality
of
indwelling
sin
does
not
nullify
what
david
calls
his
integrity
and
his
uprightness
i
think
paul
and
john
saw
that
they
were
immersed
in
the
old
testament
and
used
language
that
way
john
used
the
language
of
walking
in
the
light
though
we
are
imperfect
paul
used
the
language
of
walking
in
a
good
conscience
though
we
are
imperfect
i
think
for
all
of
them
david
paul
john
the
key
that
enabled
them
to
think
this
way
is
that
they
all
knew
god
had
made
a
way
for
all
their
sins
to
be
passed
over
—
namely
the
blood
of
the
lamb
jesus
christ
david
knew
this
was
coming
and
paul
and
john
knew
it
had
come
i
do
think
arnaldo
is
right
to
say
that
justification
by
faith
is
not
the
same
as
walking
in
a
good
conscience
or
walking
in
the
light
or
having
integrity
those
are
real
character
traits
not
imputed
righteousness
nevertheless
it
s
the
covering
of
all
their
sins
by
the
blood
of
jesus
that
enables
them
to
look
upon
their
conscience
and
walking
and
integrity
with
thankfulness
and
confidence
that
it
really
will
be
accepted
by
god
as
good
though
imperfect
people
of
integrity
here
s
one
last
implication
people
might
think
“
well
how
does
this
matter
”
here
s
a
concrete
illustration
of
how
it
matters
suppose
a
pastor
is
accused
falsely
of
being
unfaithful
to
his
wife
the
reason
he
s
accused
is
because
someone
in
the
congregation
hates
him
and
wants
him
to
be
dismissed
when
he
comes
before
the
church
or
the
elders
to
state
the
truth
with
his
children
present
and
his
wife
looking
on
that
is
not
the
time
for
him
to
say
to
the
church
“
well
yes
i
am
a
sinner
like
everybody
else
i
m
no
better
than
adulterers
everyone
has
indwelling
sin
that
crops
out
from
time
to
time
i
shouldn
t
be
put
on
a
pedestal
i
m
no
better
than
anyone
else
”
no
no
no
that
is
not
the
time
to
say
that
with
your
kids
listening
and
your
wife
listening
and
the
whole
church
wondering
what
you
need
to
say
at
that
moment
is
this
“
my
conscience
is
clear
i
am
a
man
of
integrity
i
have
walked
in
the
light
i
have
never
touched
that
woman
or
any
woman
sexually
besides
my
wife
this
accusation
is
not
true
”
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
implications
of
what
paul
is
saying
when
he
says
to
the
elders
and
to
the
rest
of
us
that
we
should
walk
in
a
good
conscience
—
or
as
john
would
say
walk
in
the
light

if
you
stopped
to
doublecheck
if
conscience
or
conscious
was
actually
being
used
incorrectly
in
any
of
the
above
examples
this
article
will
help
you
to
readily
differentiate
the
words
and
use
them
with
confidence
in
the
future
—
since
honestly
there
were
no
trick
examples
and
if
wrongly
using
conscience
in
place
of
conscious
or
vice
versa
has
never
been
on
your
conscience

it
s
our
moral
obligation
to
help
conscience
and
conscious
derive
from
the
same
latin
roots
—
the
prefix
com
with
together
jointly
and
the
verb
scire
to
know
and
the
combination
conscire
means
to
be
aware
of
guilt
—
and
both
relate
to
a
state
of
awareness
the
first
of
a
moral
awareness
and
the
second
of
a
physical
or
mental
wakefulness
in
which
a
person
is
aware
of
their
surroundings
english
speakers

aware
of
conscience
in

in

conscience
and
conscious
have
similar
pronunciations
which
for
some
causes
confusion
their
first
syllables
are
pronounced
the
same
and
they
both
contain
a
middle

sound
for
those
who
hesitate
on
which
to
use
learning
the
words
suffixes
and
their
meanings
and
also
the
words
parts
of
speech
might
be
the
best
approach
in
differentiating
them
conscience
having
the

a
noun
and

the

conscience
refers
to
a
state

actions

intentions
are
either
morally
right
or

along
with

feeling

personify
the

as

is
an
adjective

and
able
to
understand
what
is
happening
around
them
such
as
a
patient

fully
conscious

anesthesia

or
feeling

conscience
hopefully
you
are
now
fully
or

semi
conscious
of
the
differences
in
using
conscience

conscious
—
the
most
essential
one
being
that
conscience
is
a
noun
and
conscious
is
an
adjective
which
describes
nouns
keep
in
mind
that
whenever

are
in

you
should
be
conscious
about
what
your
conscience

reading
the
philosophical
and
historical
literature
on
conscience
the
first
thing
one
would
notice
is
the
variety
of
meanings
and
psychological
and
ethical
assessments
of
the
concept
different
philosophical
religious
and
common
sense
approaches
to
conscience
have
emphasized
different
aspects
of
the
following
broad
characterization
through
our
individual
conscience
we
become
aware
of
our
deeply
held
moral
principles
we
are
motivated
to
act
upon
them
and
we
assess
our
character
our
behavior
and
ultimately
our
self
against
those
principles
the
resulting
more
specific
understandings
of
conscience
will
be
presented
in
the
sections
below
on
any
of
these
accounts
conscience
is
defined
by
its
inward
looking
and
subjective
character
in
the
following
sense
conscience
is
always
knowledge
of
ourselves
or
awareness
of
moral
principles
we
have
committed
to
or
assessment
of
ourselves
or
motivation
to
act
that
comes
from
within
us
as
opposed
to
external
impositions
this
inward
looking
and
subjective
character
of
conscience
is
also
reflected
in
the
etymological
relation
between
the
notion
of
“
conscience
”
and
that
of
consciousness
only
after
the
17th
century
did
“
consciousness
”
start
to
be
used
with
a
distinct
meaning
referring
to
the
psychological
and
phenomenal
dimension
of
the
mind
rather
than
to
its
moral
dimension
for
an
account
of
the
terminological
shift
see
jorgensen
2014
the
term
“
conscience
”
translates
the
latin
“
conscientia
”
which
refers
to
sharing
“
knowledge
”
scientia
“
with
”
con
and
which
in
turns
translates
the
equivalent
greek
term
suneidenai
see
pierce
1955
and
sorabji
2014
for
an
etymological
analysis
of
the
term
the
literal
meaning
of
the
term
does
not
specify
the
type
of
knowledge
involved
and
whom
that
knowledge
is
shared
with
however
the
concept
has
traditionally
been
used
to
refer
to
moral
knowledge
we
talk
indifferently
of
conscience
and
moral
conscience
that
is
shared
with
oneself
this
reference
to
the
self
does
not
rule
out
that
the
source
of
the
morality
in
question
be
external
to
the
self
for
example
it
might
be
god
as
in
the
christian
tradition
or
the
influence
of
one
s
culture
or
of
one
s
upbringing
as
in
the
freudian
theory
of
the
superego
reference
to
the
self
indicates
that
from
a
psychological
point
of
view
conscience
involves
introspection
awareness
of
one
s
behavior
and
selfassessment
as
we
shall
see
although
these
aspects
often
overlap
they
are
psychologically
and
conceptually
distinct
functions
“
sharing
moral
knowledge
with
oneself
”
might
mean
and
imply
different
things
as
for
the
object
of
knowledge
for
example
it
might
refer
to
knowledge
of
one
s
own
conduct
in
view
of
an
assessment
of
it
against
a
certain
moral
standard
or
it
might
refer
to
knowledge
of
moral
standards
or
principles
themselves
as
for
the
“
self
”
with
whom
knowledge
is
shared
it
might
mean
sharing
knowledge
with
a
part
of
the
self
as
if
we
were
split
into
two
persons
sorabji
2014
12
but
it
might
also
mean
sharing
knowledge
with
an
imaginary
witness
such
as
an
ideal
observer
for
instance
a
god
an
imagined
moral
model
an
impartial
spectator
unfortunately
debates
in
which
appeals
to
conscience
are
often
made
—
for
example
the
debate
about
conscientious
objection
in
health
care
—
are
often
characterized
by
a
lack
of
clarity
as
to
what
it
exactly
is
that
we
are
talking
about
when
we
talk
about
conscience
and
therefore
about
what
exactly
people
are
claiming
when
they
put
forward
a
“
conscientious
objection
”
to
for
example
abortion
in
what
sense
does
abortion
violate
the
conscience
of
a
committed
catholic
doctor
and
is
conscience
amenable
to
reason
and
public
discussion
or
are
appeals
to
conscience
ultimately
based
on
intuitions
and
private
morality
in
what
sense
is
a
conscientious
choice
different
from
a
mere
moral
preference
the
notion
of
conscience
is
in
need
of
conceptual
clarification
this
entry
will
expound
the
main
features
of
the
notion
of
conscience
as
it
is
used
in
philosophical
discussion
religious
teaching
and
in
common
language
alike
the
perspective
adopted
here
will
be
theoretical
rather
than
historical
the
entry
focuses
on
the
western
tradition
and
some
examples
are
drawn
from
christian
source
the
entry
is
structured
around
four
possible
but
not
mutually
exclusive
ways
of
conceptualizing
conscience
these
will
be
preceded
by
an
introductory
section
outlining
the
pluralistic
morally
neutral
and
subjective
nature
of
the
concept
of
conscience
the
four
main
aspects
of
conscience
that
will
be
described
are
the
following
section
2
discusses
conscience
as
a
faculty
for
selfknowledge
and
selfassessment
section
3
presents
the
epistemic
aspect
of
conscience
that
allows
the
formation
of
moral
beliefs
distinguishing
the
different
possible
sources
of
moral
principles
that
inform
such
beliefs
in
section
4
conscience
will
be
described
as
a
motivational
force
or
as
the
source
of
our
sense
of
duty
which
already
presupposes
a
body
of
moral
knowledge
or
of
moral
beliefs
finally
section
5
will
focus
on
conscience
understood
as
the
body
of
personal
core
and
selfidentifying
moral
beliefs
which
is
often
taken
to
be
the
basis
of
moral
integrity

and
of
our
sense
of
personal
identity

as
discussed
in
section
6
this
last
approach
to
conscience
is
often
used
with
a
political
function
to
advocate
freedom
of
thought
and
action
in
liberal
democratic
societies
for
example
as
explained

conscience
as
pluralistic
neutral
and
subjective
the
concept
of
conscience
does
not
bear
any
connection
with
any
particular
substantial
moral
view
broad
1940
the
voice
of
conscience
might
suggest
different
principles
and
different
behaviors
to
different
people
in
other
words
there
is
no
psychological
or
conceptual
relation
between
conscience
and
any
particular
moral
belief
however
as
will
be
explained
below
in
the
catholic
tradition
the
idea
of
an
erroneous
conscience
is
sometimes
used
to
refer
to
conscience
that
fails
to
recognize
the
true
moral
laws
which
it
is
naturally
predisposed
to
“
witness
”
within
our
heart
as
for
secular
accounts
of
conscience
the
independence
of
the
notion
of
conscience
from
any
substantial
moral
content
can
be
understood
in
three
senses
first
conscience
is
a
pluralistic
notion
to
say
that
a
person
acted
with
conscience
or
that
something
violates
someone
s
conscience
does
not
entail
anything
about
what
this
act
consists
of
or
what
this
person
s
moral
values
are
although
it
might
tell
us
that
conscience
is
itself
a
value
this
person
holds
dear
to
use
a
metaphor
conscience
is
like
an
empty
box
that
can
be
filled
with
any
type
of
moral
content
as
put
by
strohm
conscience
has
what
might
be
called
an
“
identity
problem
”
—
that
it
possesses
no
fixed
or
inherited
content
of
its
own
and
that
it
can
be
hailed
and
mobilized
in
defence
of
one
position
or
equally
in
defence
of
its
rival
strohm
2011

for
example
while
some
health
practitioners
raise
“
conscientious
”
objection
to
abortion
and
refuse
to
provide
the
service
someone
s
conscience
might
demand
the
exact
opposite
i
e
to
perform
abortions
in
order
to
respect
what
is
conscientiously
believed
to
be
a
woman
s
right
joffe
1995
second
conscience
is
typically
a
morally
neutral
concept
appealing
to
conscience
does
not
usually
add
anything
to
the
moral
justification
of
any
particular
conduct
or
principle
unless
one
is
committed
to
the
relativistic
idea
that
your
belief
or
your
conscience
about
x
being
right
or
wrong
is
what
makes
it
right
or
wrong
for
you
to
do
x
foot
1979
something
is
not
made
morally
better
or
worse
acceptable
or
unacceptable
simply
by
being
a
matter
of
conscience
for
example
the
morality
of
abortion
has
nothing
to
do
with
abortion
being
conscientiously
opposed
by
some
health
practitioners
or
conscientiously
supported
by
others
this
neutrality
does
not
exclude
however
that
an
appeal
to
conscience
can
represent
itself
as
a
reason
for
respecting
someone
s
moral
views
for
example
a
reason
for
granting
someone
a
right
to
object
to
carrying
out
certain
activities
while
appeals
to
conscience
do
not
typically
provide
any
moral
reason
in
defense
of
a
certain
moral
stance
unless
one
is
a
relativist
they
might
ground
political
reasons
for
respecting
individuals
moral
beliefs
such
as
for
example
tolerance
or
pluralism
finally
conscience
only
concerns
the
subjective
dimension
of
morality
even
assuming
that
there
are
ethical
values
that
in
some
sense
can
be
considered
objective
conscience
only
refers
to
what
individuals
believe
independently
of
any
external
objective
proof
or
justification
and
when
people
state
what
they
subjectively
and
conscientiously
believe
they
acknowledge
that
other
people
might
and
probably
will
subjectively
and
conscientiously
hold
different
moral
views
thus
when
i
say
that
abortion
violates
my
conscience
i
am
not
saying
although
i
might
be
thinking
that
abortion
is
morally
wrong
by
some
objective
standard
and
i
m
not
necessarily

these

conscience
as
selfknowledge
and
selfassessment
when
we
talk
about
conscience
we
often
refer
to
reflection
about
ourselves
as
moral
persons
and
about
our
moral
conduct
through
conscience
we
examine
ourselves
as
if
we
were
our
own
inner
judge
the
image
of
an
individual
split
into
two
persons
one
who
acts
and
the
other
who
observes
the
former
s
conduct
reflects
the
original
conception
of
“
conscience
”
in
the
greek
world
at
least
from
the
5th
century

but
such
self
knowledge
may
also
be
thought
of
as
shared
with
others
inside
of
us
such
as
gods
or
other
imaginary
witnesses
for
example
an
admired
philosopher
according
to
epicurus
sorabji
2014

or
an
impartial
spectator
according
to
adam
smith
1759
the
gods
in
question
might
be
the
gods
of
a
particular
religion
such
as
the
god
of
christianity
or
a
postulate
of
the
practical
reason
such
as
in
kant
according
to
whom
reason
in
order
to
be
“
practical
”
in
the
sense
of
informing
moral
conduct
needs
the
idea
of
a
higher
authority
who
sanctions
individuals
for
their
actions
kant
1797
the
role
of
conscience
in
this
sense
is
not
that
of
merely
gaining
knowledge
about
our
behavior
or
character
the
knowledge
in
question
is
typically
though
as
explained
below
not
always
the
ground
for
a
moral
assessment
by
conscience
when
observing
one
s
behavior
conscience
is
more
like
a
judge
or
sometimes
it
is
identified
with
the
judgment
itself
than
like
a
disinterested
observer
thus
for
instance
the
impartial
spectator
with
which
adam
smith
identified
conscience
inspired
by
the
stoic
s
notion
of
conscience
as
an
imagined
admired
philosopher
judging
one
s
conduct
is
not
a
morally
and
emotionally
neutral
observer
but
generates
a
sentiment
of
approval
or
disapproval
of
oneself

even
in

view
where
the

is
that
of
a

hearts

described
in

conscience
is
also
presented
as
“

analogously
in
the
kantian
view
conscience
is
conceived
of
as
an
inner

it
is
moral
selfawareness
that
allows
one
to
apply
the
moral
law
suggested
by
practical
reason
to
our
moral
conduct
and
to
judge
whether
we
have
complied
with
the
moral
law
as
kant
defines
it
in
the
metaphysics
of
morals
conscience
is
practical
reason

the
human
being

duty
before

this
understanding
of
conscience
as
an
inner
court
is
well
illustrated
by
the
story
of
huckleberry
finn
in
mark
twain
s
famous
novel
twain
1884
bennett
1974
in
a
wellknown
episode
of
the
novel
huck
feels
guilty
and
blameworthy
for
having
helped
his
slave
friend
jim
to
escape
from
his
owner
miss
watson
blame
does
not
come
from
some
external
moral
authority
but
it
is
a
verdict
issued
by
conscience
according
to
its
moral
laws
the
bites
of
conscience
in
huck
s
case
were
caused
by
a
tension
between
his
feelings
supporting
what
he
did
and
the
principles
he
had
inherited
from
his
social
environment
at
the
time
when
the
novel
is
set
slaveowning
was
considered
a
natural
type
of
possession
and
helping
slaves
run
away
meant
depriving
someone
of
her
private
property
this
was
the
“
law
”
metaphorically
speaking
against
which
huck
s
conscience
assessed
his
behavior
this
story
illustrates
another
interesting
feature
of
conscience
as
a
faculty
for
selfassessment
i
e
the
asymmetry
between
our
confidence
in
the
validity
of
the
moral
standards
provided
by
our
own
conscience
and
our
confidence
in
the
validity
of
the
standards
provided
other
people
s
conscience
huck
thinks
that
what
he
did
was
wrong
and
that
it
rendered
him
blameworthy
in
spite
of
his
feelings
because
he
thinks
that
his
own
conscience
provides
a
correct
moral
standard
i
e
a
standard
that
he
endorses
even
if
some
of
his
feelings
or
beliefs
indicate
otherwise
this
seems
to
reflect
our
common
way
of
relating
to
our
own
conscience
we
try
to
adjust
our
feelings
and
judgments
to
our
conscience
s
standard
rather
than
vice
versa
however
the
same
does
not
hold
when
we
talk
of
other
people
s
conscience
which
is
usually
taken
to
indicate
their
subjective
moral
standard
and
does
not
imply
that
we
are
endorsing
it
this
asymmetry
suggests
that
there
is
no
conceptual
relation
between
the
notion
of
conscience
per
se
and
the
notion
of
an
objective
or
correct
moral
standard
rather
it
stresses
once
more
the
fact
that
conscience
has
merely
to
do
with
one
s
private
morality
and
one
s
commitment
to
her
own
morality
consistently
with
this
understanding
of
conscience
as
selfknowledge
and
selfassessment
it
has
been
suggested
by
some
that
psychopaths
—
i
e
pathological
subjects
who
display
antisocial
behavior
and
systematically
act
without
regard
to
what
they
consider
to
be
right
or
wrong
—
can
be
said
to
lack
conscience
hare
1999
for
instance
according
to
vujošević
2015
in
psychopaths
the
link
between
moral
knowledge
or
beliefs
and
selfdirected
feelings
of
condemnation
e
g
guilt
is
broken
psychopaths
cannot
feel
the
remorse
that
normal
functioning
agents
feel
when
they
perceive
the
discrepancy
between
their
moral
beliefs
and
their
behavior
and
as
a
consequence
psychopaths
do
not
consider
themselves
accountable
for
their
actions

2013
as
mentioned
above
in
this
section
when
expressing
itself
through
selfevaluative
feelings
conscience
might
be
conceived
of
as
either
constituted
by
such
feelings

or
as

broad
1940
in
the
former
sense
conscience
as
constituted
by

feelings
the
feeling
is
an
essential
part
of
conscience
conscience
in
this
case
is
better
conceived
not
as
a
judge
who
issues
sentences
but
as
a
feeling
with
cognitive
content
—
where
the
cognitive
content
concerns
the
adherence
of
one
s
behavior
to
a
certain
moral
standard
in
such
cases
the
negative
feeling
informs
me
that
what
i
am
doing
or
am
contemplating
doing
is
wrong
according
to
my
own
moral
parameters
in
the
latter
sense

as
occasioning

the
inner
judge
when
in

with

the
“

”
—
the

of

to

and
moral
constraints
—
takes
“
the
form

”
to
exercise
its
control
over

as

in

these
selfdirected
negative
feelings
play
an
essential
role
in
fulfilling
the
motivational
function
of
conscience
as
the
characterization
of
conscience
as
selfassessment
here
presented
suggests
conscience
has
most
often
been
associated
with
negative
feelings
arendt
1971
such
as
shame
guilt
fear
contrition
for
most
of
us
even
in
our
common
language
conscience
is
something
that
yields
negative
feelings
more
often
than
not
—
for
example
we
often
talk
of
the
“
bites
of
conscience
”
or
of
conscience
as
causing
us
“
remorse
”
which
derives
from
the
latin
“
remordere
”
i
e
“
to
bite
again
”
however
a
joyful
conscience
that
praises
and
takes
pride
of
one
s
own
moral
merit
can
be
conceived
as
well
examples
of
joyful
conscience
can
be
found
for
instance
in
cicero
and
some
latin
stoics
most
prominently

–

also
in
the
protestant
tradition
started
by
luther
we
find
the
idea
of
a
joyful
conscience
where
joy
springs
not
from
pride
or
selfpraise
but
from
awareness
of
god
s
future
remission
of

the
contrast
between
the
protestant
joyful
conscience
and
the
catholic
conscience
burdened
by
negative
feelings
of
guilt
and
fear
was
emphasized
by
luther
when
he
denounced
the
“
terrorization
of
conscience
”
by
the
roman
catholic
church
according
to
luther
with
this
terrorization
the
roman
catholic
church
aimed
to
reinforce
its
authority
and
control
over
people
conscience
in
fact
conscience
in
the
catholic
tradition
can
only
be
relieved
from
its
burden
of
negative
feelings
through
the
confession
of
one
s
sins
to
a
priest
and
the
penitence
decided
by
that
priest
3
the
epistemic
function
of
conscience
along
with
the
previous
nonepistemic
conception
of
conscience
we
can
also
understand
conscience
as
having
an
epistemic
function
in
this
sense
conscience
brings
us
some
form
of
moral
knowledge
or
moral
beliefs
—
either
in
an
absolute
sense
e
g
knowledge
of
divine
laws
or
in
a
relative
sense
e
g
knowledge
of
social
norms
in
one
s
culture
the
epistemic
role
of
conscience
does
not
necessarily
coincide
with
the
role
of
epistemic
faculties
or
functions
such
as
reason
intuitions
or
senses
in
particular
that
conscience
“
brings
”
us
moral
knowledge
or
beliefs
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
it
gives
us
direct
access
to
the
source
of
this
knowledge
or
of
these
beliefs
as
might
be
the
case
with
reason
intuitions
or
senses
the
knowledge
we
get
from
conscience
understood
as
possessing
an
epistemic
function
is
often
conceived
as
mediated
knowledge
this
is
not
surprising
since
as
we
have
seen
conscience
is
mostly
understood
as
inward
looking
which
presupposes
that
the
knowledge
to
which
it
gives
us
access
is
already
within
us
and
that
we
acquired
it
through
some
other
process
not
involving
conscience
in
fact
on
many
accounts
conscience
does
not
generate
its
own
moral
principles
for
example
the
moral
contents
we
discover
within
us
can
be
acquired
through
divine
intervention
as
is
the
case
with
the
laws
of
nature
which
according
to
christians
god
infuses
in
our
heart
as
we
are
going
to
see
in
subsection

the
understanding
of
conscience
as
having
an
epistemic
function
and
as
the
recipient
of
mediated
knowledge
is
not
exclusive
to
religious
views
on
other
accounts
of
conscience
however
conscience
does
give
us
direct
access
to
moral
knowledge
for
example
as
an
intuition
about
what
is
good
and
what
is
bad
let
us
examine
the
two
accounts
of
the
epistemic
role
of
conscience
in
more
detail

conscience
as
a
faculty
for
indirect
moral
knowledge
in
the
christian
tradition
starting
from
paul
the
inward
looking
character
of
conscience
is
emphasized
by
the
metaphor
of
the

conscience
does
not
allow
us
to
acquire
the
knowledge
of
the
moral
law
directly
from
an
external
source
god
in
this
case
but
only
to
witness
the
presence
of
god
s
laws
within
us
conscience
cannot
directly
contemplate
god
the
idea
of
a
faculty
that
gives
us
indirect
and
therefore
imperfect
knowledge
of
some
external
moral
authority
suits
religious
traditions
very
well
for
example
the
idea
that
through
conscience
we
discover
the
true
divine
laws
can
also
be
found
in

it
is
important
to
note
that
also
in
this
case
as
in
the
previous
understanding
of
conscience
as
selfawareness
and
selfassessment
conscience
can
be
conceived
as
fulfilling
an
introspective
function
i
e
as
being
directed
towards
the
self
and
towards
one
s
own
mental
states
introspection
allows
one
to
gain
selfknowledge
schwitzgebel
2014
but
since
the
self
which
is
observed
contains
the
moral
law
it
is
possible
to
say
that
the
law
itself
as
part
of
our
self
becomes
the
object
of
introspection
thus
for
instance
in
his
theological
writings
before
his
papacy
joseph
ratzinger
said
that
“
something
like
an
original
memory
of
the
good
and
the
true
the
two
are
identical
has
been
implanted
in
us
”
and
conscience
is
so
to
speak
an
inner
sense
a
capacity
to
recall
so
that
the
one
whom
it
addresses
if
he
is
not
turned
in
on
himself
hears
its
echo
from
within
ratzinger
1991
2010

the
catholic
church
also
makes
reference
to
“
the
voice
of
the
lord
echoing
in
the
conscience
of
every
individual

for

saw
conscience
as
the
moral
sense
that
can

to
the
moral
truth
as
such
conscience
is
in
his
view
both
epistemic
and
action
guiding
but
the
two
aspects
are
not
distinguishable
to
the
extent
that
the
moral
truth
is
what
guides
our
actions
as
he
wrote
“
the
feeling
of
conscience
is
twofold
it
is
a
moral
sense
and
a
sense
of
duty
a
judgment
of
the
reason
and
a
magisterial
dictate
of
course
its
act
is
indivisible
still
it

two
aspects

and

on
a
secular
account
the
external
source
of
moral
knowledge
that
instills
moral
principles
in
us
is
not
god
but
one
s
own
culture
or
upbringing
in
this
case
the
moral
knowledge
in
question
is
typically
understood
in
a
relativistic
sense
our
conscience
is
the
faculty
through
which
the
social
norms
of
our
culture
or
the
norms
of
our
upbringing
are
evoked
and
exert
their
influence
on
our
moral
psychology
these
norms
explain
our
moral
feelings
and
our
moral
choices
but
what
conscience
tells
us
in
this
case
is
the
product
of
social
and
cultural
dynamics
over
which
we
have
little
control
as
the
case
of
huckleberry
finn
s
conscience
demonstrates
hardly
can
conscience
so
understood
be
credited
any
moral
authority
since
our
educators
or
our
culture
might
be
highly
immoral
for
example
our
conscience
might
end
up
drawing
on
racist
or
discriminatory
principles
such
as
the
ones
which
supported
slavery
in
huck
s
social
environment
and
in
fact
unsurprisingly
many
are
rather
skeptical
or
dismissive
of
the
moral
authority
of
conscience
since
they
see
it
as
mere
opinion
about
moral
principles
influenced
or
even
determined
by
one

conscience
as
a
faculty
for

moral
knowledge
contrary
to
what
montaigne
and

had
claimed
rousseau
argued
in
emile
or
education
that
good
education
can
free
conscience
from
the
corrupting
influences
of
societies
actually
one
of
the
aims
of
education
is
to
render
the
young
autonomous
moral
thinkers
and
agents
by
teaching
them
how
to
critically
examine
and
if
necessary
replace
received
norms
rousseau
1762
see
sorabji
2014
for
a
discussion
the
idea
here
is
that
conscience
is
what
remains
of
our
innate
moral
sense
once
we
free
it
from
“
childish
errors
”
and
“
prejudices
of
our
upbringing
”
rousseau
1921

as
rousseau
presents
it
there
is
therefore
at
the
bottom
of
our
hearts
an
innate
principle
of
justice
and
virtue
by
which
in
spite
of
our
maxims
we
judge
our
own
actions
or
those
of
others
to
be
good
or
evil
and
it
is
this
principle
that
i
call
conscience
rousseau
1921
1762
253
according
to
rousseau
then
conscience
has
a
natural
tendency
to
perceive
and
follow
the
right
order
of
nature
and
a
good
teacher
should
help
the
young
s
conscience
to
do
what
it
is
naturally
predisposed
to
do
in
rousseau
s
words
too
often
does
reason
deceive
us
we
have
only
too
good
a
right
to
doubt
her
but
conscience
never
deceives
us
she
is
the
true
guide
of
man
it
is
to
the
soul
what
instinct
is
to
the
body
he
who
obeys
his
conscience
is
following
nature
and
he
need
not
fear
that
he
will
go
astray
let
us
obey
the
call
of
nature
we
shall
see
that
her
yoke
is
easy
and
that
when
we
give
heed
to
her
voice
we
find
a
joy
in
the
answer
of
a
good
conscience
rousseau

this
understanding
of
conscience
as
a
deeper
form
of
moral
knowledge
brings
us
to
the
second
sense
in
which
conscience
can
be
said
to
have
an
epistemic
role
as
well
as
merely
witnessing
received
opinions
or
divine
laws
conscience
can
also
be
conceived
as
a
moral
sense
giving
us
direct
access
to
moral
principles
understood
in
this
way
conscience
is
typically
seen
as
intuitive
and

by
emotions

than

the

implies
that

a
powerful

is

by
the

that
arises

conscience
for

is
therefore
not
only
an
inner

but
also

conscience
s
selfassessment
often
produces
remorse
or
other
negative
feelings
guilt
shame
fear
and
so
on
our
desire
or
tendency
to
avoid
this
form
of
selfpunishment
can
have
motivational
force
towards
acting
morally
thus
for
instance
according
to
childress
the
motive
for
acting
morally
that
defines
conscience
is
“
in

avoidance
of
a
sanction
imposed
by
the
self
on

”

328
consistent
with
this
philosophical
view
are
studies
in
developmental
psychology
suggesting
that
the
emotion
of
guilt
which
is
typically
seen
as
one
of
the
products
of
conscience
as
selfassessment
is
“
the
motivational
engine
that
infuses

as

however
at
the
same
time
the
negative
selfdirected
feelings
must
themselves
be
generated
by
previous
experience
of
tension
between
our
action
and
a
preexisting
sense
of
duty
although
it
might
seem
that
we
are
stuck
in
an
infinite
regress
where
sense
of
duty
and
negative
selfdirected
feelings
presuppose
one
another
this
need
not
be
the
case
it
is
possible
to
conceive
of
an
external
or
independent
source
of
that
most
fundamental
sense
of
duty
that
constitutes
our
conscience
such
as
for
example
our

but
the
sense
of
duty
that
identifies
a
conscientious
person
can
also
be
conceived
as
a
primitive
function
an
innate
disposition
which
is
not
explained
by
any
other
more
fundamental
mechanism
in
kant
for
instance
“
every
human
being

being

a
conscience

him

”

negative
feelings
and
sense
of
duty
are
not
always
successful
in
prompting
agents
to
do
what
their
moral
principles
require
but
the
“
bites
of
conscience
”
or
just
the
prospect
of
bites
of
conscience
act
as
motivational
force
towards
aligning
our
future
behavior
to
those
norms
of
course
positive
feelings
associated
with
conscience
might
also
have
a
motivational
force
for
example
as
seen
above
kant
associated
conscience
also
with
positive
feelings
about
oneself
when
the
agent
recognizes
he
has
acted
according
to
his
sense
of

rousseau
alongside
the
epistemic
account
of
conscience
presented
above
also
provides
in
emile
a
motivational
account
of
conscience
based
on
positive
feelings
while
reason
gives
us
knowledge
of
the
good
it
is

through

sentiment

of

space
in

the

finds

often
grounds
the
political
use

the
notion

thus
many
people
claim
the

—
particularly
by
advancing
so
called
“

—
when

demand
otherwise
these
political
appeals
to
conscience
are
usually
made
on
the
basis
of
two
principles
the
first
is
the
principle
of
respect
for
moral
integrity
which
finds
its
justification
in
the
close
relationship
between
the
notions
of
conscience
and
of
moral
integrity
on
one
side

the

other
the

”
is
the
principle
of

sense

sense
—
is

conscience
as

two
ways
it

moral

we

a
sense
in
which

to

conscience

psychopaths
are
not
capable
of
connecting
their
moral
knowledge
to
their
conduct
through
the
feelings
of
guilt
and
disapproval
which
conscience
on
some
accounts
produces
interestingly
according
to
some
psychologists
psychopaths
are
also
less
likely
to
base
their

of
personal

on
moral

normal

more
recent
psychological
studies
have
suggested
that
people
tend
to
link
the
identity
of
others
not
so
much
to
their
memories
as
traditionally
believed
but
to
their
morals
it
is
the
loss
of
one
s
moral
character
and
moral
beliefs
rather
than
of
one
s

that
leads
us
to
say
that

anymore

these

provide

freedom
of
conscience
some
people
have
suggested
that
appeals
to
freedom
of
conscience
tend
to
be
more
vigorously
put
forward
and
more
effective
in
contexts
where
political
or
religious
structures
lose
power
or
moral
authority

there
are
three
main
arguments
that
can
be
used
to
defend
a
principle
of
freedom
of
conscience
two
of
them
are
frequently
found
in
the
16th
and
17th
century
philosophical
literature
they
are
the
“
argument
from
ineffectiveness
or
hypocrisy
”
and
the
“
argument
from
ignorance
”

a
third
argument
which
might
be
called
“
argument
from
legitimization
”
was
put
forward
by
john
stuart
mill
let
us
examine
them
in
order
a
the
argument
from
ineffectiveness
or
hypocrisy
is
based
on
the
relevance
of
the
distinction
between
beliefs
and
acts
for
the
definition
of
conscience
according
to
this
argument
it
is
not
possible
to
compel
someone
to
believe
or
to
not
believe
something
i
e
to
change
one
s
conscientious
beliefs
all
we
can
do
is
compel
people
to
act
as
if
they
believed
something
which
would
be
a
hypocritical
behavior
therefore
if
some
authority
aims
to
convert
people
or
to
change
people
s
moral
views
prohibiting
the
free
expression
through
actions
of
one
s
conscience
would
not
serve
this
purpose
this
line
of
argument
was
often
put
forward
by
early
christians
most
notably
christian
apologist
tertullian
to
defend
their
freedom
to
practice
their
cult
in
a
time
where
they
were
persecuted
by
roman
governors
their
claim
was
that
forcing
them
to
abandon
the
christian
cults
would
have
no
effect
on
their
conscience
the
same
line
of
argument
can
also
be
found
in
locke
s
works
on
toleration
the
essay
concerning
toleration
of
1667
and
a
letter
concerning
toleration
of
1689
however
christians
did
not
seem
to
believe
in
the
force
of
this
argument
and
more
generally
in
the
principle
of
freedom
of
conscience
when
later
on
they
attempted
to
justify
the
violent
persecution
of
heretics
those
who
revise
their
religious
dogmas
and
apostates
those
who
abandon
their
religion
and
their
forced
conversion

two
main
justifications
have
been
given
by
christian
theologians
for
the
forced
conversion
of
heretics
and
apostates
one
can
be
found
among
others
in
aquinas
and
calvin
who
thought
that
violent
persecution
is
justified
because
heretics
mistaken
views
would
exert
great
influence
on
many
ordinary
people
by
departing
from
the
christian
doctrine
these
people
would
be
condemned
to
eternal
damnation
in
the
afterlife
and
christians
have
a
duty
to
save
as
many
people
as
possible
from
eternal
damnation
clarke

a
second
type
of
argument
in
defense
of
violent
persecution
is
the
one
offered
by
augustine
5th
century
he
argued
that
compelling
people
to
follow
the
true
religion
—
by
which
he
meant
persecuting
heretics
—
could
open
their
eyes
to
the
truth
sorabji

this
thesis
implies
that
sometimes
conscience
even
if
we
confine
it
to
matters
of
inward
conviction
and
not
to
behavior
can
be
influenced
by
some
external
imposition
this
latter
approach
based
on
the
idea
of
bringing
the
truth
to
conscience
by
“
freeing
”
conscience
from
error
is
consistent
with
the
catholic
peculiar
understanding
of
the
notion
of
freedom
of
conscience
philosophically
speaking
“
freedom
of
conscience
”
is
typically
understood
as
an
individualistic
concept
that
allows
for
a
plurality
of
moral
and
religious
views
strohm
2011
90
for
the
catholic
church
however
authentic
freedom
is
inseparable
from
the
notion
of
truth
inspired
by
the
works
of
the
english
theologian
and
cardinal
john
henry
newman
joseph
ratzinger
writes
that
in
the
catholic
view
“
truth
”
is
the
middle
term
that
reconciles
authority
of
god
and
subjectivity
of
conscience
the
latter
when
authentically
free
cannot
but
reveal
the
truth
established
by
the
former
ratzinger
1991
2010
since
as
we
have
seen
above
in
the
catholic
view
reason
alone
can
t
create
its
own
values
which
are
instilled
by
god
into
humans
hearts
“
human
freedom
finds
its
authentic
and
complete
fulfillment
precisely
in
the
acceptance
of
that
law
”
of
god
john
paul
ii
1993
par
35
so
when
practical
reason
is
free
to
exercise
its
“
participation
”
john
paul
ii
1993
sec
40
in
the
divine
law
then
“
in
the
depths
of
his
conscience
man
detects
a
law
which
he
does
not
impose
upon
himself
but
which
holds
him
to
obedience
”
paul
vi
1965
par
16
in
any
case
it
is
not
necessary
to
dismiss
the
argument
from
ineffectiveness
in
order
to
justify
imposing
norms
and
practices
that
might
violate
individuals
conscience
actually
the
same
argument
from
ineffectiveness
can
be
used
to
support
the
imposition
of
policies
that
might
conflict
with
individuals
consciences
on
the
basis
of
the
idea
that
conscience
is
merely
a
matter
of
private
beliefs
not
of
action
some
authors
have
argued
that
compelling
people
to
follow
certain
rules
even
against
their
conscience
would
not
constitute
a
violation
of
their
freedom
of
conscience
and
is
therefore
justifiable
this
was
the
line
of
argument
pursued
for
example
by
thomas
hobbes
1651
chapter
40
baruch
spinoza
1670
chapter
20
and
john
locke
1660
who
argued
that
the
state
has
the
power
to
enforce
certain
practices
even
when
citizens
claim
that
it
would
violate
their
conscience
in
order
to
protect
social
order
b
the
“
argument
from
ignorance
”
which
might
be
better
labeled
“
argument
from
humility
”
is
based
on
a
skeptical
approach
to
the
content
of
conscience
the
possibility
exists
that
what
we
conscientiously
believe
is
wrong
and
that
those
holding
conscientious
beliefs
opposite
to
ours
are
right
therefore
there
is
a
reason
for
not
forcing
anyone
to
believe
in
something
or
to
engage
in
behaviors
that
might
turn
out
to
be
morally
wrong
the
argument
from
ignorance
or
humility
started
to
be
put
forward
quite
frequently
and
most
prominently
by
pierre
bayle
1686
–
1688
after
the
catholic
church
lost
a
significant
proportion
of
its
religious
and
moral
authority
following
the
protestant
reform
in
16th
and
17th
century
—
which
was
defined
by
keith
thomas
1993
as
“
the
age
of
conscience
”
it
was
at
that
time
that
we
assisted
to
the
“
secularization
of
conscience
”
in
the
modern
era
strohm
2011
although
the
phenomenon
would
be
better
conceived
of
as
a
“
resecularization
”
since
conscience
was
not
related
to
the
voice
or
the
authority
of
god
in
the
greek
world
the
same
argument
from
ignorance
or
from
humility
is
also
put
forward
by
john
locke
in
his
second
letter
concerning
toleration
locke
had
to
rely
on
this
argument
as
an
alternative
strategy
to
defend
freedom
of
conscience
after
the
anglican
priest
jonas
proast
pointed
out
that
compulsion
can
actually
change
personal
beliefs
as
augustine
had
argued
and
that
therefore
the
argument
from
ineffectiveness
that
locke
had
used
in
his
first
letter
fails
sorabji
2014
151
a
version
of
the
argument
from
ignorance
can
also
be
found
in
contemporary
defenses
of
conscientious
objection
in
an
age
where
pluralism
of
worldviews
is
acknowledged
and
actually
supported
for
example
sulmasy
appeals
to
epistemic
humility
as
“
true
basis
of
tolerance
”
sulmasy
2008

in
his
arguments
in
support
of
a
right
to
conscientious
objection
in
health
care
c
finally
the
third
argument
in
defense
of
freedom
of
conscience
is
what
i
have
called
above
the
“
argument
from
legitimization
”
john
stuart
mill
1859
defended
freedom
of
conscience
by
appealing
to
the
idea
that
allowing
the
free
expression
of
any
opinion
and
particularly
mistaken
opinions
would
allow
truth
to
emerge
more
clearly
and
would
provide
us
with
a
justification
for
acting
upon
our
own
beliefs
once
they
have
been
assessed
against
others
opinions
as
put
by
mill
complete
liberty
of
contradicting
and
disproving
our
opinion
is
the
very
condition
which
justifies
us
in
assuming
its
truth
for
purposes
of
action
and
on
no
other
terms
can
a
being
with
human
faculties
have
any
rational
assurance
of
being
right

freedom
of
conscience
and
conscientious
objection
today
freedom
of
conscience
is
today
protected
by
the
united
nations
universal
declaration
of
human
rights
which
reads
“
everyone
has
the
right
to
freedom
of
thought
conscience
and
religion
”
art
18
according
to
strohm
this
article
should
not
be
taken
to
imply
freedom
to
act
according
to
one
s
conscience
but
it
only
refers
to
“
matters
of
inward
conviction
”
strohm
2011

if
this
interpretation
is
correct
article
18
does
not
seem
to
raise
any
interesting
philosophical
or
practical
problem
today
as
very
few
people
today
would
deny
freedom
in
matters
of
inward
conviction
more
problematic
is
the
moral
and
political
debate
about
the
freedom
to
act
or
to
refrain
from
acting
according
to
one
s
conscience
especially
where
there
are
professional
roles
or
legal
obligations
that
would
demand
otherwise
in
fact
appeals
to
conscience
and
freedom
of
conscience
are
often
deployed
to
claim
and
justify
“
conscientious
objection
”
to
certain
activities
that
someone
would
otherwise
be
required
to
perform
one
example
is
conscientious
objection
to
the
military
service
where
conscription
is
in
place
although
originally
conscientious
objection
to
war
was
mainly
a
religious
issue
the
quakers
were
the
most
famous
group
of
conscientious
objectors
to
war
in
more
recent
times
the
objection
to
war
has
been
put
forward
and
granted
without
explicit
reference
to
any
religious
justification
moskos
and
chamber
1993
as
most
states
have
now
abolished
conscription
appeals
to
freedom
of
conscience
and
to
conscientious
objection
today
can
be
found
mainly
in
debates
in
medical
ethics
with
regard
to
health
practitioners
who
conscientiously
object
to
performing
medical
procedures
they
morally
oppose
such
as
abortions

overviews
of
the
debate

medical

according

who
are
against

right
to

professional

value

it
is
the
validity

soundness
of

no

at

conclusion
there
is
no
such
a
thing
as
the
notion
of
conscience
both
in
a
philosophical
and
in
a
psychological
sense
as
we
have
seen
the
concept
of
conscience
has
been
given
different
interpretations
throughout
history
sometimes
on
the
basis
of
underlying
systematic
philosophical
theories
of
the
mind
and
of
morality
and
sometimes
serving
religious
or
political
purposes
this
lack
of
uniformity
is
not
only
a
problem
for
historians
and
theoretical
philosophers
because
it
cannot
be
immediately
clear
what
we
are
talking
about
when
we
talk
of
conscience
of
freedom
of
conscience
or
of
conscientious
objection
it
is
important
that
clarity
is
made
every
time
conscience
is
appealed
to
in
different
branches
of
applied
philosophy
particularly
medical
ethics
and
in
public
debates
alike
this
entry
has
presented
a
conceptual
map
rather
than
a
historical
account
of
conscience
which
can
provide
some
guidance
for
those
engaged
in
this
clarificatory
task
one
of
the
benefits
of
clarifying
concepts
and
clarifying
them
in
the
different
circumstances
in
which
they
are
used
is
their
subsequent
demystification
conscience
needs
to
be
demystified
since
it
is
one
of
those
concepts
that
tend
to
elicit
reverence
rather
than
questions
or
an
interest
in
further
inquiry
as
seen
above
appeals
to
conscience
often
replace
reason
giving
and
are
made
with
the
expectation
that
no
further
reason
for
one
s
decisions
and
positions
is
requested
this
attitude
is
also
displayed
in
many
legislative
approaches
dealing
with
the
notion
of
conscience
in
particular
legislations
about
conscientious
objection
in
health
care
typically
grant
doctors
a
right
to
object
to
performing
certain
professional
activities
e
g
conscientious
objection
to
abortion
without
requiring
them
to
provide
reasons
for
their
objection
let
alone
submitting
reasons
to
some
form
of
assessment
this
entry
has
distinguished
four
main
understandings
of
conscience
drawing
on
the
philosophical
tradition
of
the
concept
whether
the
concept
is
to
be
understood
as
a
faculty
for
selfknowledge
and
selfassessment
or
as
having
an
epistemic
function
in
the
sphere
of
morality
or
as
a
motivational
force
or
again
as
a
set
of
selfidentifying
moral
beliefs
or
a
combination
of
any
of
these
characterizations
it
is
important
to
have
clear
in
mind
what
exactly
we
are
talking
about
when
we
talk
of
conscience
and
of
freedom
of
conscience
in
each
circumstance
far
from
being
a
conversationstopper
conscience
can
only
find
its
proper
place
in
philosophical
and
in
public
discussion
if
its
philosophical
and
psychological
aspects
are
teased
out
defined
and
assessed
appeals
to
conscience
can
only
be
part
of
philosophical
political
and
legal
discussion
if
they
are
seen
as
the
start
not
the
end

discussions

cognitive
process
that
elicits
emotion
and
rational
associations
based
on
an
individual
s
moral
philosophy
or
value
system
conscience
stands
in

thought
due
to
associations
based
on
immediate
sensory
perceptions
and
reflexive
responses
as
in
sympathetic

nervous
system
responses
in
common
terms
conscience
is
often
described
as
leading
to
feelings
of
remorse
when
a
person
commits
an
act
that
conflicts
with
their
moral
values
the
extent
to
which
conscience
informs
moral
judgment
before
an
action
and
whether
such
moral
judgments
are
or
should
be
based
on
reason
has
occasioned
debate
through
much
of
modern

between
theories
of
basics
in
ethic
of

life

to
the
theories
of
romanticism
and
other
reactionary
movements
after
the
end
of
the
middle

religious
views

it
as

inherent
in

a

andor
to

diverse
ritualistic

features
of

of

thus
manifests
in

as
unselfish
love
for
all
living

gradually
intensifies

to

in

that
conscience
was
the
human
capacity

that
were
congruent

true
tranquil

26
many
christians
regard
following
one
s

as
important
as
or
even
more
important
than
obeying
human
authority
27
according
to
the
bible
written
in
romans
215
conscience
is
the
one
bearing
witness
accusing
or
excusing
one
another
so
we
would
know
when
we
break
the
law
written
in
our
hearts
the
guilt
we
feel
when
we
do
something
wrong
tells
us
that
we
need
to
repent

catholic
theology
sees
conscience
as
the
last
practical
judgment
of
reason
which
at
the
appropriate
moment
enjoins
a
person
to
do
good
and
to
avoid
evil
33
the
second
vatican
council
1962
–
65
describes
deep
within
his
conscience
man
discovers
a
law
which
he
has
not
laid
upon
himself
but
which
he
must
obey
its
voice
ever
calling
him
to
love
and
to
do
what
is
good
and
to
avoid
evil
tells
him
inwardly
at
the
right
movement
do
this
shun
that
for
man
has
in
his
heart
a
law
inscribed
by
god
his
dignity
lies
in
observing
this
law
and
by
it
he
will
be
judged
his
conscience
is
man
s
most
secret
core
and
his
sanctuary
there
he
is
alone
with
god
whose
voice
echoes
in
his
depths
34
thus
conscience
is
not
like
the
will
nor
a
habit
like
prudence
but
the
interior
space
in
which
we
can
listen
to
and
hear
the
truth
the
good
the
voice
of
god
it
is
the
inner
place
of
our
relationship
with
him
who
speaks
to
our
heart
and
helps
us
to
discern
to
understand
the
path
we
ought
to
take
and
once
the
decision
is
made
to
move
forward
to
remain
faithful35
in
terms
of
logic
conscience
can
be
viewed
as
the
practical
conclusion
of
a
moral
syllogism
whose
major
premise
is
an
objective
norm
and
whose
minor
premise
is
a
particular
case
or
situation
to
which
the
norm
is
applied
thus
catholics
are
taught
to
carefully
educate
themselves
as
to
revealed
norms
and
norms
derived
therefrom
so
as
to
form
a
correct
conscience
catholics
are
also
to
examine
their
conscience
daily
and
with
special
care
before
confession
catholic
teaching
holds
that
man
has
the
right
to
act
according
to
his
conscience
and
in
freedom
so
as
personally
to
make
moral
decisions
he
must
not
be
forced
to
act
contrary
to
his
conscience
nor
must
he
be
prevented
from
acting
according
to
his
conscience
especially
in
religious
matters
36
this
right
of
conscience
does
not
allow
one
to
arbitrarily
disagree
with
church
teaching
and
claim
that
one
is
acting
in
accordance
with
conscience
a
sincere
conscience
presumes
one
is
diligently
seeking
moral
truth
from
authentic
sources
that
is
seeking
to
conform
oneself
to
that
moral
truth
by
listening
to
the
authority
established
by
christ
to
teach
it
nevertheless
despite
one
s
best
effort
it
can
happen
that
moral
conscience
remains
in
ignorance
and
makes
erroneous
judgments
about
acts
to
be
performed
or
already
committed
 
this
ignorance
can
often
be
imputed
to
personal
responsibility
 
in
such
cases
the
person
is
culpable
for
the
wrong
he
commits
37
thus
if
one
realizes
one
may
have
made
a
mistaken
judgment
one
s
conscience
is
said
to
be
vincibly
erroneous
and
it
is
not
a
valid
norm
for
action
one
must
first
remove
the
source
of
error
and
do
one
s
best
to
achieve
a
correct
judgment
if
however
one
is
not
aware
of
one
s
error
or
if
despite
an
honest
and
diligent
effort
one
cannot
remove
the
error
by
study
or
seeking
advice
then
one
s
conscience
may
be
said
to
be
invincibly
erroneous
it
binds
since
one
has
subjective
certainty
that
one
is
correct
the
act
resulting
from
acting
on
the
invincibly
erroneous
conscience
is
not
good
in
itself
yet
this
deformed
act
or
material
sin
against
god
s
right
order
and
the
objective
norm
is
not
imputed
to
the
person
the
formal
obedience
given
to
such
a
judgment
of
conscience
is
good
some
catholics
appeal
to
conscience
in
order
to
justify
dissent
not
on
the
level
of
conscience
properly
understood
but
on
the
level
of
the
principles
and
norms
which
are
supposed
to
inform
conscience
for
example
some
priests
make
on
the
use
of
the
socalled
internal
forum
solution
which
is
not
sanctioned
by
the
magisterium
to
justify
actions
or
lifestyles
incompatible
with
church
teaching
such
as
christ
s
prohibition
of
remarriage
after
divorce
or
sexual
activity
outside
marriage
citation
needed
the
catholic
church
has
warned
that
rejection
of
the
church
s
authority
and
her
teaching
 
can
be
at
the
source
of
errors
in
judgment
in
moral
conduct
38
an
example
of
someone
following
his
conscience
to
the
point
of
accepting
the
consequence
of
being
condemned
to
death
is
sir
thomas

39
a
theologian
who
wrote
on
the
distinction
between
the
sense
of
duty
and
the
moral
sense
as
two
aspects
of
conscience
and
who
saw
the
former
as
some
feeling
that
can
only
be
explained
by
a
divine
lawgiver
was
john

40
a
well
known
saying
of
him
is
that
he
would
first
toast
on
his
conscience
and
only
then
on
the
pope
since
his
conscience
brought
him
to
acknowledge
the
authority
of
the
pope
41
judaism
arguably
does
not
require
uncompromising
obedience
to
religious
authority
the
case
has
been
made
that
throughout
jewish
history
rabbis
have
circumvented
laws
they
found
unconscionable
such
as
capital
punishment
42
similarly
although
an
occupation
with
national
destiny
has
been
central
to
the
jewish
faith
see
zionism
many
scholars
including
moses
mendelssohn
stated
that
conscience
as
a
personal
revelation
of
scriptural
truth
was
an
important
adjunct
to
the
talmudic
tradition

the
concept
of
inner
light
in
the
religious
society
of
friends
or
quakers
is
associated
with
conscience

freemasonry
describes
itself
as
providing
an
adjunct
to
religion
and
key
symbols
found
in

and
compasses
explained
as
providing
lessons
that
masons
should

actions
by
the
square
of

learn
to
circumscribe
their
desires
and
keep
their

45
the
historian
manning
clark
viewed
conscience
as
one
of
the
comforters
that
religion
placed
between
man
and
death
but
also
a
crucial
part
of
the
quest
for
grace
encouraged
by
the
book
of
job
and
the
book
of
ecclesiastes
leading
us
to
be
paradoxically
closest
to
the
truth
when
we
suspect
that
what
matters
most
in
life
being
there
when
everyone
suddenly
understands
what
it
has
all
been
for
can
never
happen
46

an

thus
a

is
associated
with

sigmund
freud
regarded
conscience
as
originating
psychologically
from
the
growth
of
civilisation
which
periodically
frustrated
the
external
expression
of
aggression
this
destructive
impulse
being
forced
to
seek
an
alternative
healthy
outlet
directed
its
energy
as
a
superego
against
the
person
s
own
ego
or
selfishness
often
taking
its
cue
in
this
regard
from
parents
during
childhood
58
according
to
freud
the
consequence
of
not
obeying
our
conscience
is
guilt
which
can
be
a
factor
in
the
development
of
neurosis
freud
claimed
that
both
the
cultural
and
individual
superego
set
up
strict
ideal
demands
with
regard
to
the
moral
aspects
of
certain
decisions
disobedience
to
which
provokes
a
fear
of

others

of

the
claim
of

to
moral

emerged
from
the

of

in
the

for

in

behavior
destructive

a

either
to

to

bad
or
evil
63
thus
conscience
can
be
viewed
as
an
outcome
of
those
biological
drives
that
prompt
humans
to
avoid
provoking
fear
or
contempt
in

being
experienced
as
guilt

shame
in

64
a

of

in

the

66
fundamental
in
this
view
of
conscience
is
that
humans
consider
some
other
as
being
in
a
social
relationship
thus
nationalism
is
invoked
in
conscience
to
quell
tribal
conflict

the

evolutionary

contemporary
scientists
in

seek
to
explain

evolved
to
facilitate
altruism
within
societies
74

can

s

minds
that
our

can
be
derived
from
our
darwinian
past
he
subsequently
reinforced
this
idea
through
the
lens
of
the
genecentered
view
of
evolution
since
the
unit
of
natural
selection
is
neither
an
individual
organism
nor
a
group
but
rather
the
selfish
gene
and
these
genes
could
ensure
their

survival

inter

pushing

to

altruistically

is

early
modern
theologians
such
as
william
perkins
and
william

developed

syllogistic
understanding

where
god
s

made

79
a
13
thus
conscience
was
considered
an
act
or
judgment
of
practical
reason
that
began
with
synderesis
the
structured
development
of
our
innate
remnant
awareness
of
absolute
good
which
he
categorised
as
involving
the
five
primary
precepts
proposed
in
his
theory
of
natural
law
into
an
acquired
habit
of
applying
moral
principles
50
according
to
singer
aquinas
held
that
conscience
or
conscientia
was
an
imperfect
process
of
judgment
applied
to
activity
because
knowledge
of
the
natural
law
and
all
acts
of

virtue
implicit
therein
was
obscured

aquinas
also
discussed
conscience
in
relation
to
the
virtue
of
prudence
to
explain
why
some
people
appear
to
be
less
morally
enlightened
than
others
their
weak
will
being
incapable
of
adequately
balancing
their
own
needs
with
those
of
others
95
aquinas
reasoned
that
acting
contrary
to
conscience
is
an
evil
action
but
an
errant
conscience
is
only
blameworthy
if
it
is
the
result
of
culpable
or
vincible
ignorance
of
factors
that
one
has
a
duty
to
have
knowledge
of
94
aquinas
also
argued
that
conscience
should
be
educated
to
act
towards
real
goods
from
god
which
encouraged
human
flourishing
rather
than
the
apparent
goods
of
sensory
pleasures
94
in
his
commentary
on
aristotle
s
nicomachean
ethics
aquinas
claimed
it
was
weak
will
that
allowed
a
nonvirtuous
man
to
choose
a
principle
allowing
pleasure
ahead
of
one
requiring
moral
constraint
96
thomas
a
kempis
in
the
medieval
contemplative
classic
the
imitation
of
christ
ca
1418
stated
that
the
glory
of
a
good
man
is
the
witness
of
a
good
conscience
preserve
a
quiet
conscience
and
you
will
always
have
joy
a
quiet
conscience
can
endure
much
and
remains
joyful
in
all
trouble
but
an
evil
conscience
is
always
fearful
and
uneasy
97
the
anonymous
medieval
author
of
the
christian
mystical
work
the
cloud
of
unknowing
similarly
expressed
the
view
that
in
profound
and
prolonged
contemplation
a
soul
dries
up
the
root
and
ground
of
the
sin
that
is
always
there
even
after
one
s
confession
and
however
busy
one
is
in
holy
things
therefore
whoever
would
work
at
becoming
a
contemplative
must
first
cleanse
his
or
her
conscience
98
the
medieval
flemish
mystic
john
of
ruysbroeck
likewise
held
that
true
conscience
has
four
aspects
that
are
necessary
to
render
a
man
just
in
the
active
and
contemplative
life
a
free
spirit
attracting
itself
through
love
an
intellect
enlightened
by
grace
a
delight
yielding
propension
or
inclination
and
an
outflowing
losing
of
oneself
in
the
abyss
of
 
that
eternal
object
which
is
the
highest
and
chief
blessedness
 
those
lofty
amongst
men
are
absorbed
in
it
and
immersed
in
a
certain
boundless
thing
99
modern
edit
schopenhauer
considered
that
the
good
conscience
we
experience
after
an
unselfish
act
verifies
that
our
true
self
exists
outside
our
physical
person

moral
problems
and
our
emotional
responses
to
them
should
be
reasoned
from
the
perspective
of

kant
the
moral
law
within
us
has
true
infinity
benedict
de
spinoza
in
his
ethics
published
after
his
death
in
1677
argued
that
most
people
even
those
that
consider
themselves
to
exercise
free
will
make
moral
decisions
on
the
basis
of
imperfect
sensory
information
inadequate
understanding
of
their
mind
and
will
as
well
as
emotions
which
are
both
outcomes
of
their
contingent
physical
existence
and
forms
of
thought
defective
from
being
chiefly
impelled
by
selfpreservation
100
the
solution
according
to
spinoza
was
to
gradually
increase
the
capacity
of
our
reason
to
change
the
forms
of
thought
produced
by
emotions
and
to
fall
in
love
with
viewing
problems
requiring
moral
decision
from
the
perspective
of
eternity
101
thus
living
a
life
of
peaceful
conscience
means
to
spinoza
that
reason
is
used
to
generate
adequate
ideas
where
the
mind
increasingly
sees
the
world
and
its
conflicts
our
desires
and
passions
sub
specie
aeternitatis
that
is
without
reference
to
time
102
hegel
s
obscure
and
mystical
philosophy
of
mind
held
that
the
absolute
right
of
freedom
of
conscience
facilitates
human
understanding
of
an
allembracing
unity
an
absolute
which
was
rational
real
and
true
103
nevertheless
hegel
thought
that
a
functioning
state
would
always
be
tempted
not
to
recognize
conscience
in
its
form
of
subjective
knowledge
just
as
similar
nonobjective
opinions
are
generally
rejected
in
science
104
a
similar
idealist
notion
was
expressed
in
the
writings
of
joseph
butler
who
argued
that
conscience
is
godgiven
should
always
be
obeyed
is
intuitive
and
should
be
considered
the
constitutional
monarch
and
the
universal
moral
faculty
conscience
does
not
only
offer
itself
to
show
us
the
way
we
should
walk
in
but
it
likewise
carries
its
own
authority
with
it
105
butler
advanced
ethical
speculation
by
referring
to
a
duality
of
regulative
principles
in
human
nature
first
selflove
seeking
individual
happiness
and
second
benevolence
compassion
and
seeking
good
for
another
in
conscience
also
linked
to
the
agape
of
situational
ethics
51
conscience
tended
to
be
more
authoritative
in
questions
of
moral
judgment
thought
butler
because
it
was
more
likely
to
be
clear
and
certain
whereas
calculations
of
selfinterest
tended
to
probable
and
changing
conclusions
106
john
selden
in
his
table
talk
expressed
the
view
that
an
awake
but
excessively
scrupulous
or
illtrained
conscience
could
hinder
resolve
and
practical
action
it
being
like
a
horse
that
is
not
well
wayed
he
starts
at
every
bird
that
flies
out
of
the
hedge
107
as
the
sacred
texts
of
ancient
hindu
and
buddhist
philosophy
became
available
in
german
translations
in
the
18th
and
19th
centuries
they
influenced
philosophers
such
as
schopenhauer
to
hold
that
in
a
healthy
mind
only
deeds
oppress
our
conscience
not
wishes
and
thoughts
for
it
is
only
our
deeds
that
hold
us
up
to
the
mirror
of
our
will
the
good
conscience
thought
schopenhauer
we
experience
after
every
disinterested
deed
arises
from
direct
recognition
of
our
own
inner
being
in
the
phenomenon
of
another
it
affords
us
the
verification
that
our
true
self
exists
not
only
in
our
own
person
this
particular
manifestation
but
in
everything
that
lives
by
this
the
heart
feels
itself
enlarged
as
by
egotism
it
is
contracted
108
immanuel
kant
a
central
figure
of
the
age
of
enlightenment
likewise
claimed
that
two
things
filled
his
mind
with
ever
new
and
increasing
admiration
and
awe
the
oftener
and
more
steadily
they
were
reflected
on
the
starry
heavens
above
me
and
the
moral
law
within
me
 
the
latter
begins
from
my
invisible
self
my
personality
and
exhibits
me
in
a
world
which
has
true
infinity
but
which
i
recognise
myself
as
existing
in
a
universal
and
necessary
and
not
only
as
in
the
first
case
contingent
connection
109
the
universal
connection
referred
to
here
is
kant
s
categorical
imperative
act
only
according
to
that
maxim
by
which
you
can
at
the
same
time
will
that
it
should
become
a
universal
law
110
kant
considered
critical
conscience
to
be
an
internal
court
in
which
our
thoughts
accuse
or
excuse
one
another
he
acknowledged
that
morally
mature
people
do
often
describe
contentment
or
peace
in
the
soul
after
following
conscience
to
perform
a
duty
but
argued
that
for
such
acts
to
produce
virtue
their
primary
motivation
should
simply
be
duty
not
expectation
of
any
such
bliss
111
rousseau
expressed
a
similar
view
that
conscience
somehow
connected
man
to
a
greater
metaphysical
unity
john
plamenatz
in
his
critical
examination
of
rousseau
s
work
considered
that
conscience
was
there
defined
as
the
feeling
that
urges
us
in
spite
of
contrary
passions
towards
two
harmonies
the
one
within
our
minds
and
between
our
passions
and
the
other
within
society
and
between
its
members
the
weakest
can
appeal
to
it
in
the
strongest
and
the
appeal
though
often
unsuccessful
is
always
disturbing
however
corrupted
by
power
or
wealth
we
may
be
either
as
possessors
of
them
or
as
victims
there
is
something
in
us
serving
to
remind
us
that
this
corruption
is
against
nature
112
john
locke
viewed
the
widespread
social
fact
of
conscience
as
a
justification
for
natural
rights
adam
smith
conscience
shows
what
relates
to
ourselves
in
its
proper
shape
and
dimensions
samuel
johnson
1775
stated
that
no
man
s
conscience
can
tell
him
the
right
of
another
man
other
philosophers
expressed
a
more
sceptical
and
pragmatic
view
of
the
operation
of
conscience
in
society
113
john
locke
in
his
essays
on
the
law
of
nature
argued
that
the
widespread
fact
of
human
conscience
allowed
a
philosopher
to
infer
the
necessary
existence
of
objective
moral
laws
that
occasionally
might
contradict
those
of
the
state
114
locke
highlighted
the
metaethics
problem
of
whether
accepting
a
statement
like
follow
your
conscience
supports
subjectivist
or
objectivist
conceptions
of
conscience
as
a
guide
in
concrete
morality
or
as
a
spontaneous
revelation
of
eternal
and
immutable
principles
to
the
individual
if
conscience
be
a
proof
of
innate
principles
contraries
may
be
innate
principles
since
some
men
with
the
same
bent
of
conscience
prosecute
what
others
avoid
115
thomas
hobbes
likewise
pragmatically
noted
that
opinions
formed
on
the
basis
of
conscience
with
full
and
honest
conviction
nevertheless
should
always
be
accepted
with
humility
as
potentially
erroneous
and
not
necessarily
indicating
absolute
knowledge
or
truth
116
william
godwin
expressed
the
view
that
conscience
was
a
memorable
consequence
of
the
perception
by
men
of
every
creed
when
the
descend
into
the
scene
of
busy
life
that
they
possess
free
will
117
adam
smith
considered
that
it
was
only
by
developing
a
critical
conscience
that
we
can
ever
see
what
relates
to
ourselves
in
its
proper
shape
and
dimensions
or
that
we
can
ever
make
any
proper
comparison
between
our
own
interests
and
those
of
other
people
118
john
stuart
mill
believed
that
idealism
about
the
role
of
conscience
in
government
should
be
tempered
with
a
practical
realisation
that
few
men
in
society
are
capable
of
directing
their
minds
or
purposes
towards
distant
or
unobvious
interests
of
disinterested
regard
for
others
and
especially
for
what
comes
after
them
for
the
idea
of
posterity
of
their
country
or
of
humanity
whether
grounded
on
sympathy
or
on
a
conscientious
feeling
119
mill
held
that
certain
amount
of
conscience
and
of
disinterested
public
spirit
may
fairly
be
calculated
on
in
the
citizens
of
any
community
ripe
for
representative
government
but
that
it
would
be
ridiculous
to
expect
such
a
degree
of
it
combined
with
such
intellectual
discernment
as
would
be
proof
against
any
plausible
fallacy
tending
to
make
that
which
was
for
their
class
interest
appear
the
dictate
of
justice
and
of
the
general
good
119
josiah
royce
1855
–
1916
built
on
the
transcendental
idealism
view
of
conscience
viewing
it
as
the
ideal
of
life
which
constitutes
our
moral
personality
our
plan
of
being
ourself
of
making
common
sense
ethical
decisions
but
he
thought
this
was
only
true
insofar
as
our
conscience
also
required
loyalty
to
a
mysterious
higher
or
deeper
self
120
in
the
modern
christian
tradition
this
approach
achieved
expression
with
dietrich
bonhoeffer
who
stated
during
his
imprisonment
by
the
nazis
in
world
war
ii
that
conscience
for
him
was
more
than
practical
reason
indeed
it
came
from
a
depth
which
lies
beyond
a
man
s
own
will
and
his
own
reason
and
it
makes
itself
heard
as
the
call
of
human
existence
to
unity
with
itself
121
for
bonhoeffer
a
guilty
conscience
arose
as
an
indictment
of
the
loss
of
this
unity
and
as
a
warning
against
the
loss
of
one
s
self
primarily
he
thought
it
is
directed
not
towards
a
particular
kind
of
doing
but
towards
a
particular
mode
of
being
it
protests
against
a
doing
which
imperils
the
unity
of
this
being
with
itself
52
conscience
for
bonhoeffer
did
not
like
shame
embrace
or
pass
judgment
on
the
morality
of
the
whole
of
its
owner
s
life
it
reacted
only
to
certain
definite
actions
it
recalls
what
is
long
past
and
represents
this
disunion
as
something
which
is
already
accomplished
and
irreparable
122
the
man
with
a
conscience
he
believed
fights
a
lonely
battle
against
the
overwhelming
forces
of
inescapable
situations
which
demand
moral
decisions
despite
the
likelihood
of
adverse
consequences
122
simon
soloveychik
has
similarly
claimed
that
the
truth
distributed
in
the
world
as
the
statement
about
human
dignity
as
the
affirmation
of
the
line
between
good
and
evil
lives
in
people
as
conscience
123
dietrich
bonhoeffer
1932
as
hannah
arendt
pointed
out
however
following
the
utilitarian
john
stuart
mill
on
this
point
a
bad
conscience
does
not
necessarily
signify
a
bad
character
in
fact
only
those
who
affirm
a
commitment
to
applying
moral
standards
will
be
troubled
with
remorse
guilt
or
shame
by
a
bad
conscience
and
their
need
to
regain
integrity
and
wholeness
of
the
self
124125
representing
our
soul
or
true
self
by
analogy
as
our
house
arendt
wrote
that
conscience
is
the
anticipation
of
the
fellow
who
awaits
you
if
and
when
you
come
home
126
arendt
believed
that
people
who
are
unfamiliar
with
the
process
of
silent
critical
reflection
about
what
they
say
and
do
will
not
mind
contradicting
themselves
by
an
immoral
act
or
crime
since
they
can
count
on
its
being
forgotten
the
next
moment
bad
people
are
not
full
of
regrets
126
arendt
also
wrote
eloquently
on
the
problem
of
languages
distinguishing
the
word
consciousness
from
conscience
one
reason
she
held
was
that
conscience
as
we
understand
it
in
moral
or
legal
matters
is
supposedly
always
present
within
us
just
like
consciousness
and
this
conscience
is
also
supposed
to
tell
us
what
to
do
and
what
to
repent
before
it
became
the
lumen
naturale
or
kant
s
practical
reason
it
was
the
voice
of
god
127
albert
einstein
associated
conscience
with
suprapersonal
thoughts
feelings
and
aspirations
albert
einstein
as
a
selfprofessed
adherent
of
humanism
and
rationalism
likewise
viewed
an
enlightened
religious
person
as
one
whose
conscience
reflects
that
he
has
to
the
best
of
his
ability
liberated
himself
from
the
fetters
of
his
selfish
desires
and
is
preoccupied
with
thoughts
feelings
and
aspirations
to
which
he
clings
because
of
their
superpersonal
value
128
einstein
often
referred
to
the
inner
voice
as
a
source
of
both
moral
and
physical
knowledge
quantum
mechanics
is
very
impressive
but
an
inner
voice
tells
me
that
it
is
not
the
real
thing
the
theory
produces
a
good
deal
but
hardly
brings
one
closer
to
the
secrets
of
the
old
one

am
at
all
events
convinced

129
simone
weil
who
fought
for
the
french
resistance
the
maquis
argued
in
her
final
book
the
need
for
roots
prelude
to
a
declaration
of
duties
towards
mankind
that
for
society
to
become
more
just
and
protective
of
liberty
obligations
should
take
precedence
over
rights
in
moral
and
political
philosophy
and
a
spiritual
awakening
should
occur
in
the
conscience
of
most
citizens
so
that
social
obligations
are
viewed
as
fundamentally
having
a
transcendent
origin
and
a
beneficent
impact
on
human
character
when
fulfilled
130131
simone
weil
also
in
that
work
provided
a
psychological
explanation
for
the
mental
peace
associated
with
a
good
conscience
the
liberty
of
men
of
goodwill
though
limited
in
the
sphere
of
action
is
complete
in
that
of
conscience
for
having
incorporated
the
rules
into
their
own
being
the
prohibited
possibilities
no
longer
present
themselves
to
the
mind
and
have
not
to
be
rejected
132
alternatives
to
such
metaphysical
and
idealist
opinions
about
conscience
arose
from
realist
and
materialist
perspectives
such
as
those
of
charles
darwin
darwin
suggested
that
any
animal
whatever
endowed
with
wellmarked
social
instincts
the
parental
and
filial
affections
being
here
included
would
inevitably
acquire
a
moral
sense
or
conscience
as
soon
as
its
intellectual
powers
had
become
as
well
or
as
nearly
as
well
developed
as
in
man
133
émile
durkheim
held
that
the
soul
and
conscience
were
particular
forms
of
an
impersonal
principle
diffused
in
the
relevant
group
and
communicated
by
totemic
ceremonies
134
a
j
ayer
was
a
more
recent
realist
who
held
that
the
existence
of
conscience
was
an
empirical
question
to
be
answered
by
sociological
research
into
the
moral
habits
of
a
given
person
or
group
of
people
and
what
causes
them
to
have
precisely
those
habits
and
feelings
such
an
inquiry
he
believed
fell
wholly
within
the
scope
of
the
existing
social
sciences
135
george
edward
moore
bridged
the
idealistic
and
sociological
views
of
critical
and
traditional
conscience
in
stating
that
the
idea
of
abstract
rightness
and
the
various
degrees
of
the
specific
emotion
excited
by
it
are
what
constitute
for
many
persons
the
specifically
moral
sentiment
or
conscience
for
others
however
an
action
seems
to
be
properly
termed
internally
right
merely
because
they
have
previously
regarded
it
as
right
the
idea
of
rightness
being
present
in
some
way
to
his
or
her
mind
but
not
necessarily
among
his
or
her
deliberately
constructed
motives

the

philosopher
simone

in

reflects
within
her
own
conscience
about
her
mother
s
attempts
to
develop
such
a
moral
sympathy
and
understanding
of
others
137
the
sight
of
her
tears
grieved
me
but
i
soon
realised
that
she
was
weeping
over
her
failure
without
caring
about
what
was
happening
inside
me
 
we
might
still
have
come
to
an
understanding
if
instead
of
asking
everybody
to
pray
for
my
soul
she
had
given
me
a
little
confidence
and

i
know
now
what
prevented
her
from

much
to

made
every
sacrifice

her

did
not
take
her
out
of
herself
besides
how
could
she
have
tried
to
understand
me
since
she
avoided
looking
into
her

as
for
discovering
an
attitude
that
would
not
have
set
us
apart
nothing
in

life
had
ever
prepared
her
for
such
a
thing
the

sent
her
into

in
a
readymade
framework

michael
walzer
claimed
that
the
growth
of
religious
toleration
in
western
nations
arose
amongst
other
things
from
the
general
recognition
that
private
conscience
signified
some
inner
divine
presence
regardless
of
the
religious
faith
professed
and
from
the
general
respectability
piety
selflimitation
and
sectarian
discipline
which
marked
most
of
the
men
who
claimed
the
rights
of
conscience
138
walzer
also
argued
that
attempts
by
courts
to
define
conscience
as
a
merely
personal
moral
code
or
as
sincere
belief
risked
encouraging
an
anarchy
of
moral
egotisms
unless
such
a
code
and
motive
was
necessarily
tempered
with
shared
moral
knowledge
derived
either
from
the
connection
of
the
individual
to
a
universal
spiritual
order
or
from
the
common
principles
and
mutual
engagements
of
unselfish
people
139
ronald
dworkin
maintains
that
constitutional
protection
of
freedom
of
conscience
is
central
to
democracy
but
creates
personal
duties
to
live
up
to
it
freedom
of
conscience
presupposes
a
personal
responsibility
of
reflection
and
it
loses
much
of
its
meaning
when
that
responsibility
is
ignored
a
good
life
need
not
be
an
especially
reflective
one
most
of
the
best
lives
are
just
lived
rather
than
studied
but
there
are
moments
that
cry
out
for
selfassertion
when
a
passive
bowing
to
fate
or
a
mechanical
decision
out
of
deference
or
convenience
is
treachery
because
it
forfeits
dignity
for
ease
140
edward
conze
stated
it
is
important
for
individual
and
collective
moral
growth
that
we
recognise
the
illusion
of
our
conscience
being
wholly
located
in
our
body
indeed
both
our
conscience
and
wisdom
expand
when
we
act
in
an
unselfish
way
and
conversely
repressed
compassion
results
in
an
unconscious
sense
of
guilt
141
peter
singer
distinguished
between
immature
traditional
and
highly
reasoned
critical
conscience
the
philosopher
peter
singer
considers
that
usually
when
we
describe
an
action
as
conscientious
in
the
critical
sense
we
do
so
in
order
to
deny
either
that
the
relevant
agent
was
motivated
by
selfish
desires
like
greed
or
ambition
or
that
he
acted
on
whim
or
impulse
142
moral
antirealists
debate
whether
the
moral
facts
necessary
to
activate
conscience
supervene
on
natural
facts
with
a
posteriori
necessity
or
arise
a
priori
because

roger
scruton
has
claimed
that
true
understanding
of

its

with

has
been
hampered
by
an
impetuous
belief
that
philosophical
questions
are
solved
through
the
analysis
of
language
in
an
area
where
clarity
threatens
vested
interests
145
susan
sontag
similarly
argued
that
it
was
a
symptom
of
psychological
immaturity
not
to
recognise
that
many
morally
immature
people
willingly
experience
a
form
of
delight
in
some
an
erotic
breaking
of

when
witnessing

emmanuel
levinas
viewed
conscience
as
a
revelatory
encountering
of
resistance
to
our
selfish
powers

morality
by
calling
into

our
naive
sense
of
freedom
of
will
to
use
such
powers
arbitrarily

with
violence
this
process
being
more
severe
the
more
rigorously
the
goal
of
our
self
was
to
obtain
control
153
in
other
words
the
welcoming
of
the
other
to
levinas
was
the
very
essence
of
conscience
properly
conceived
it
encouraged
our
ego
to
accept
the
fallibility
of
assuming
things
about
other
people
that
selfish
freedom
of
will
does
not
have
the
last
word
and
that
realising
this
has

john
rawls
in
his
a
theory
of
justice
defines
a
conscientious
objector
as
an
individual
prepared
to
undertake
in
public
and
often
despite
widespread
condemnation
an
action
of
civil
disobedience
to
a
legal
rule
justifying
it
also
in
public
by
reference
to
contrary
foundational
social
virtues
such
as
justice
as
liberty
or
fairness
and
the
principles
of
morality
and
law
derived
from
them
160
rawls
considered
civil
disobedience
should
be
viewed
as
an
appeal
warning
or
admonishment
showing
general
respect
and
fidelity
to
the
rule
of
law
by
the
nonviolence
and
transparency
of
methods
adopted
that
a
law
breaches
a
community
s
fundamental
virtue
of
justice
160
objections
to
rawls
theory
include
first
its
inability
to
accommodate
conscientious
objections
to
the
society
s
basic
appreciation
of
justice
or
to
emerging
moral
or
ethical
principles
such
as
respect
for
the
rights
of
the
natural
environment
which
are
not
yet
part
of
it
and
second
the
difficulty
of
predictably
and
consistently
determining
that
a
majority
decision
is
just
or
unjust
161
conscientious
objection
also
called
conscientious
refusal
or
evasion
to
obeying
a
law
should
not
arise
from
unreasoning
naive
traditional
conscience
for
to
do
so
merely
encourages
infantile
abdication
of
responsibility
to
calibrate
the
law
against
moral
or
human
rights
norms
and
disrespect
for
democratic
institutions
162
instead
it
should
be
based
on
critical
conscience
–
seriously
thought
out
conceptually
mature
personal
moral
or
religious
beliefs
held
to
be
fundamentally
incompatible
that
is
not
merely
inconsistent
on
the
basis
of
selfish
desires
whim
or
impulse
for
example
either
with
all
laws
requiring
conscription
for
military
service
or
legal
compulsion
to
fight
for
or
financially
support
the
state
in

particular

163

when
henry
david
thoreau
the
author

was
willingly
jailed
for
refusing
to
pay

profoundly
disagreed

conscientious

so
for
religious

—

by
doctrine
other
objections
can
stem
from
a
deep
sense

as

or
from
the
conviction
that

condemned

160
john
dewey
considered
that
conscientious

were
often
the
victims
of
moral
innocency
and
inexpertness
in
moral
training
the
moving
force
of
events
is
always
too
much
for
conscience
170
the
remedy
was
not
to
deplore
the
wickedness
of
those
who
manipulate
world
power
but
to
connect
conscience
with
forces
moving
in
another
direction
to
build
institutions
and
social
environments
predicated
on
the
rule
of
law
for
example
then
will
conscience
itself
have
compulsive
power
instead
of
being
forever
the
martyred
and
the
coerced
170
as
an
example
albert
einstein
who
had
advocated
conscientious
objection
during
the
first
world
war
and
had
been
a
longterm
supporter
of
war
resisters
international
reasoned
that
radical
pacifism
could
not
be
justified
in
the
face
of

advocated

171
samuel
johnson
pointed
out
that
an
appeal
to
conscience
should
not
allow
the
law
to
bring
unjust
suffering
upon
another
conscience
according
to
johnson
was
nothing
more
than
a
conviction
felt
by
ourselves
of
something
to
be
done
or
something
to
be
avoided
in
questions
of
simple
unperplexed
morality
conscience
is
very
often
a
guide
that
may
be
trusted
172
but
before
conscience
can
conclusively
determine
what
morally
should
be
done
he
thought
that
the
state
of
the
question
should
be
thoroughly
known
172
no
man
s
conscience
said
johnson
can
tell
him
the
right
of
another
man
 
it
is
a

very
ill
informed
that
violates
the
rights
of
one

conscience
is
the
universalist
idea
that
with

all
people
on
earth
will
no
longer
be
morally
estranged
from
one
another
whether
it
be
culturally

instead
they
will
conceive

from

of

rather
than
have
their

often
this
derives
from
a
spiritual
or
natural

perspective
that
for

peace
to
be
achieved
conscience
properly
understood
should
be
generally
considered
as
not
necessarily

as

form

deters

264
bradley
develops
a
theory
about
hamlet
s
moral
agony
relating
to
a
conflict
between
traditional
and
critical
conscience
the
conventional
moral
ideas
of
his
time
which
he
shared
with
the
ghost
told
him
plainly
that
he
ought
to
avenge
his
father
but
a
deeper
conscience
in
him
which
was
in
advance
of
his
time
contended
with
these
explicit
conventional
ideas
it
is
because
this
deeper
conscience
remains
below
the
surface
that
he
fails
to
recognise
it
and
fancies
he
is
hindered
by
cowardice
or
sloth
or
passion
or
what
not
but
it
emerges
into
light
in
that
speech
to
horatio
and
it
is
just
because
he
has
this
nobler
moral
nature
in
him
that
we
admire

point

have
turned
their
back

268

abandoning

he
travelled
to
the
distant
island

sakhalin
the
most
feared
place
of
exile
and
forced
labour
in
russia
at
that
time
one
cannot
help
but
wonder
why
simply
because
the
lot
of
the
people
there
was
a
bitter
one
because
nobody
really
knew
about
the
lives
and
deaths
of
the
exiles
because
he
felt
that
they
stood
in
greater
need
of
help
that
anyone
else
a
strange
reason
maybe
but
not
for
a
writer
who
was
the
epitome
of
all
the
best
traditions
of
a
russian
man
of
letters
russian

has
always
focused

questions

text

timothy
15
one
of
the
goals
of
preachingteaching
the
word
of
god
is
a
“
good
conscience
”
our
conscience
is
designed
to
help
guide
us
to
do
what
is
right
“
right
”
depends
on
how
it
is
trained
if
we
want
to
accomplish
this
goal
we
need
to
understand
more
about
the
conscience
there
are
at
least
six
different
types
of
conscience
addressed
in
the
new
testament
we
will
consider
them
here
good
conscience
a
 
good
conscience
is
one
which
is
free
from
guilt
–
we
are
doing
what
we
believe
to
be
right
used
two
different
ways
in
the
nt
of
those
who
did
right
and
those
who
did
wrong
those
who
do
right
are
to
have
a
 
good
conscience
1
timothy
15
–
keep
a
good
conscience
1
timothy
119
if
we
follow
god
we
can
have
confidence
not
fear
1
john
321
22829
however
it
is
possible
to
do
 
wrong
and
have
a
 
good
conscience
acts
231
–
paul
did
many
things
against
christ
acts
26911
1
timothy
11315
he
believed
he
was
right
acts
2416
many
have
a
 
good
conscience
because
they
do
what
“
seems
right
”
to
them
proverbs
1412
–
but
this
is
not
enough
defiled
conscience
a
 
defiled
conscience
is
one
which
causes
one
to
feel
guilt
for
doing
what
is
either
right
or
innocent
–
 
right
is
something
required
by
god
2
timothy
31617
 
innocent
is
not
right
or
wrong
in
itself
romans
1423
in
corinth
some
had
a
 
defiled
conscience
1
corinthians
87
–
much
of
the
meat
sold
in
the
markets
in
corinth
had
been
used
previously
in
idol
worship
paul
explained
that
buyingeating
it
did
not
constitute
participation
in
idolatry
1
corinthians
846
however
those
“
accustomed
to
the
idol
”
could
not
separate
the
idol
worship
from
eating
1
corinthians
87
–
for
them
to
eat
would
violate
their
conscience
and
embolden
them
to
sin
1
corinthians
81011
cf
romans
1423
if
one
has
a
 
defiled
conscience
they
need
to
be
patiently
taught
the
truth
romans
141
cf
acts
1826
seared
conscience
a
 
seared
conscience
is
one
that
no
longer
feels
guilt
for
sin
–
whether
one
followed
the
right
or
wrong
standard
it
is
a
conscience
that
has
been
violated
so
many
times
that
it
no
longer
works
the
spirit
warned
of
those
who
would
fall
away
due
to
a
 
seared
conscience
1
timothy
412
–
when
one
sins
godly
sorrow
leads
him
to
repentance
2
corinthians
710
feels
guilty
wants
to
be
right
but
when
sin
becomes
 
persistent
and
habitual
guilt
is
no
longer
there
genesis
65
jeremiah
615
a
 
seared
conscience
is
prevented
by
laying
aside
sin
hebrews
121
rather
than
continuing
in
it
2
timothy
313
–
if
one
has
a
 
seared
conscience
little
can
be
done
until
they
have
a
change
of
heart
hebrews
646
weak
conscience
a
 
weak
conscience
is
one
that
has
simply
not
been
trained
in
what
is
right
–
lacks
knowledge
from
god
that
provides
the
right
standard
in
corinth
a
 
weak
conscience
led
to
a
 
defiled
conscience
1
corinthians
87
–
lacked
knowledge
one
can
have
a
 
weak
conscience
and
also
have
a
 
good
conscience
acts
231
1
timothy
113
the
remedy
for
a
weak
conscience
is
 
training
in
the
word
of
god
hebrews

evil
conscience
an
 
evil
conscience
is
one
that
has
not
been
forgiven
of
sin
hebrews

all
have
had
an
 
evil
conscience
at
some
point

a
 
clear
pure
kjv
conscience
is
one
that
has
been
forgiven
1
timothy
39
–
cleansed
by
christ
this
is
the
 
good
conscience
of
those
who
do
right
1
timothy

1
peter
316
we
cannot
purify
our
conscience
on
our
own
–
must
appeal

god
to
do
it
1
peter

god
cleanses
us
when
we
obey
the
gospel
romans

john
17
conclusion
the
goal
of
our
instruction
is
a
“
good
conscience
”
–
but
goodness
is
by
god
s
standard
not
man
s
it
is
not
enough
for
us
to
think
we
are
doing
what
is
right
–
we
must
actually
be
right
involves
knowledge
obedience
and
forgiveness
we
can
have
“
our
hearts
sprinkled
clean
from
an
evil
conscience
”

our
inherent
nature
of
an
evil
conscience
knows
to
do
good
and
doesn
t
such
a
one
rightly
divides
the
truth
from
error
and
is
bewitched
to
disobediently
choose
error

but
sanctify
the
lord
god
in
your
hearts
where
conscience
resides
and
be
ready
always
to
give
an
answer
to
every
man
that
asketh
you
a
reason
of
the
hope
that
is
in
you
with
meekness
and

conscience

having
a
good
conscience
that
whereas
they
speak
evil
of
you
as
of
evildoers
they
may
be
ashamed
that
falsely
accuse
your
good
conversation
in
christ
heb
1022
let
us
draw
near
with
a
true
heart

full
assurance

faith

our
hearts
sprinkled

hebrews
1022
is
the
only
verse
in
the
bible
that
directly
refers
to
an
“
evil
conscience
”
however
as
previously
pointed
out
the
bible
abounds
with
stark
nuances
of
both
forms
of
a
good
or
evil
conscience
it
is
impossible
to
speak
about
specific
evil
consciences
without
juxtaposing
them
with
their
corresponding
good
conscience
as
we
have
seen
in
the
preceding
studies
a
good
conscience
is
dramatically
differentiated
by
adam
and
eve
partaking
of
the
tree
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
subsequently
a
pandora
s
box
of
evil
conscience
blooms
like
leavening
in
bread
dough
as
such
mr
barid
s
order
of
sixteen
headings
for
his
conscience
study
does
not
descend
in
order
of
authority
but
rather
it
is
in
order
of
scriptural
reference

our
study
today
is
on
an
“
evil
conscience
”
yet
when
we
review
the
above
headings
the
vast
majority
of
them
are
all
aspects
of
an
evil
conscience
nonetheless
it
is
the
saint
s
godgiven
passion
to
study
every
detail
of
his
word
leaving
nothing
alive
that
breathes
of
misunderstanding
and
thus
our
continuation
of
the
sixteen
mostly
evil
versions
of
our
conscience
clearly
adam
and
cain
within
us
initiated
the
many
forms
of
evil
consciences
yet
the
first
time
the
term
is
directly
used
is
in
hebrews
1022
the
entire
bible
bleeding
defiled
evil
consciences
from
the
beginning
to
near
the
end
hebrews
10
admonishes
us
to
remain
faithful
to
the
new
covenant
in
christ
and
not
regress
to
the
laws
of
moses
so
etched
in
our
hearts
that
we
temporarily
battle
a
dual
of
tortured
consciences
as
paul
did
regarding
circumcision
heb
1019
 
having
therefore
brethren
boldness
to
enter
into
the
holiest
by
the
blood
of
jesus
heb
1020
 
by
a
new
and
living
way
one
that
literally
leads
to
life
eternal
which
he
hath
consecrated
for
us
through
the
veil
that
is
to
say
his
flesh
revealing
the
path
to
a
more
excellent
conscience
heb
1021
 
and
having
an
high
priest
over
the
house
of
god
heb
1022
 
let
us
draw
near
with
a
true
heart
in
full
assurance
of
faith
having
our
hearts
sprinkled
a
sprinkle
little
by
little
is
the
beginning
of
a
storm
a
flood
of
truth
from
an
evil
conscience
and
our
bodies
washed
with
pure
water
heb
1023
 
let
us
hold
fast
the
new
profession
of
our
faith
without
wavering
for
he
is
faithful
that
promised
 
christ
s
mission
was
to
declare
the
father
and
our
worship
of
him
in
spirit
and
in
truth
formally
israel
worshiped
god
by
attempting
to
keep
his
laws
through
physical
washings
and
sacrifices
that
most
certainly
caused
his
people
a
good
conscience
via
those
laws
yet
as
depicted
by
saul
who
became
paul
his
pricked
conscience
while
under
the
slavery
of
the
old
covenant
was
subliminally
aware
of
a
strange
new
conscience
opposing
most
turbulently
his
established
beliefs
paul
s
boldness
became
dramatically
evident
through
his
earthquake
of
miraculous
blindness
as
he
whimpered
”
who
art
thou
lord
”
and
the
lord
said
i
am
jesus
whom
thou
persecutest
it
is
hard
for
thee
to
kick
against
the
pricks
acts
9
paul
s
conscience
was
kicking
against
the
pricks
of
his
murderous
ways
and
imploring
eyes
staring
back
at
him
upon
his
many
stonings
as
he
demanded
the
church
of
the
day
adhere
to
moses
s
laws
subliminally
he
couldn
t
identify
why
these
people
over
whom
he
lorded
authority
couldn
t
and
wouldn
t
remain
as
faithful
as
he
a
new
disconcerting
spirit
of
change
was
blowing
upon
his
mind
by
the
one
who
had
the
power
to
change
the
way
mankind
worshiped
god
christ
cast
aside
the
physicality
of
the
old
covenant
to
create
in
man
a
worship
of
god
by
the
same
laws
only
by
spirit
and
not
by
sweat
it
was
a
shift
in
how
each
of
us
now
perceived
what
constituted
an
evil
conscience
and
was
earthshattering
that
seismic
shift
in
how
to
live
by
the
law
was
quickly
realized
to
be
immensely
liberating
its
overpowering
joy
eclipsed
martyrdom
as
steven
exemplified
in
acts
7
heb
711
 
if
therefore
perfection
were
by
the
levitical
priesthood
for
under
it
the
people
received
the
law
what
further
need
was
there
that
another
priest
should
rise
after
the
order
of
melchisedec
and
not
be
called
after
the
order
of
aaron
 
heb
712
 
for
the
priesthood
being
changed
there
is
made
of
necessity
a
change
also
of
the
law
 
heb
713
 
for
he
of
whom
these
things
are
spoken
pertaineth
to
another
tribe
of
which
no
man
gave
attendance
at
the
altar
 
heb
714
 
for
it
is
evident
that
our
lord
sprang
out
of
juda
of
which
tribe
moses
spake
nothing
concerning
priesthood
unlike
paul
moses
wasn
t
given
or
ready
to
have
his
conscience
pricked
by
a
better
conscience
by
the
holy
spirit
heb
715
 
and
it
is
yet
far
more
evident
for
that
after
the
similitude
of
melchisedec
there
ariseth
another
priest
 
heb
716
 
who
is
made
not
after
the
law
of
a
carnal
commandment
but
after
the
power
of
an
endless
life
 
heb
717
 
for
he
testifieth
thou
art
a
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
melchisedec
 
heb
718
 
for
there
is
verily
a
disannulling
of
the
commandment
going
before
for
the
weakness
and
unprofitableness
thereof
heb
719
 
for
the
law
made
nothing
perfect
but
the
bringing
in
of
a
better
hope
did
by
the
which
we
draw
nigh
unto
god
 
heb
720
 
and
inasmuch
as
not
without
an
oath
he
was
made
priest
heb
721
 
for
those
priests
were
made
without
an
oath
but
this
with
an
oath
by
him
that
said
unto
him
the
lord
sware
and
will
not
repent
thou
art
a
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
melchisedec
 
heb
722
 
by
so
much
was
jesus
made
a
surety
of
a
better
testament
heb
723
 
and
they
truly
were
many
priests
because
they
were
not
suffered
to
continue
by
reason
of
death
 
heb
724
 
but
this
man
because
he
continueth
ever
hath
an
unchangeable
priesthood
governed
by
a
pure
conscience
 
heb
725
 
wherefore
he
is
able
also
to
save
them
to
the
uttermost
that
come
unto
god
by
him
seeing
he
ever
liveth
to
make
intercession
for
them
heb
726
 
for
such
an
high
priest
became
us
who
is
holy
harmless
a
pure
conscience
casts
out
all
fear
undefiled
separate
from
sinners
and
made
higher
than
the
heavens
 
heb
727
 
who
needeth
not
daily
as
those
high
priests
to
offer
up
sacrifice
first
for
his
own
sins
and
then
for
the
people
s
for
this
he
did
once
when
he
offered
up
himself
 
heb
728
 
for
the
law
maketh
men
high
priests
which
have
infirmity
but
the
word
of
the
oath
which
was
since
the
law
maketh
the
son
who
is
consecrated
for
evermore

highlights
the
most
profound
shift
of
a
good
conscience
to
a
means
to
attain
a
pure
conscience
through
christ
our
high
priest
stephen
was
so
committed
to
the
spirit
of
a
good
conscience
of
greater
purity
that
he
was
willing
to
be
martyred
stephen
christ
and
all
the
martyrs
of
old
all
died
having
acted
in
good
faith
in
accordance
with
their
consciences
defying
an
evil
conscience
and
so
too
does
the
bride
of
christ
from
that
foundation
arises
the
focus
of
this
study
and
our
immovable
confidence
heb
1022
 
let
us
draw
near
with
a
true
heart
in
full
assurance
of
faith
having
our
hearts
sprinkled
from
an
evil
conscience
and
our
bodies
washed
with
pure
water
for
those
given
understanding
what
a
glorious
and
most
joyful
release
it
is
to
be
under
christ
s
light
yoke
where
he
is
the
author
of
the
temple
he
is
constructing
the
following
scriptures
annul
an
evil
conscience
1jn
318
 
my
little
children
let
us
not
love
in
word
neither
in
tongue
but
in
deed
and
in
truth
 
1jn
319
 
and
hereby
we
know
that
we
are
of
the
truth
and
shall
assure
our
hearts
before
him
there
in
the
above
scripture
lies
a
conscience
that
is
a
foundation
to
rightly
discern
the
truth
and
in
the
below
scripture
the
bisection
of
choosing
by
his
will
a
good
or
evil
conscience
1jn
320
 
for
if
our
heart
condemn
us
god
is
greater
than
our
heart
and
knoweth
all
things
if
we
are
an
elect
of
god
he
assures
us
that
our
heart
that
is
our
mind
will
know
the
difference
between
a
good
and
evil
conscience
and
our
lord
will
provide
the
power
for
us
to
ultimately
learn
to
choose
righteously
1jn
321
 
beloved
if
our
heart
condemn
us
not
then
have
we
confidence
toward
god
1jn
322
 
and
whatsoever
we
ask
we
receive
of
him
because
we
keep
his
commandments
and
do
those
things
that
are
pleasing
in
his
sight
how
easy
is
it
to
simply
ask
our
lord
to
give
us
a
pure
conscience
in
all
that
we
think
if
we
thus
have
that
pure
conscience
we
are
keeping
all
the
commandments
of
christ
and
our
hope
in
the
first
resurrection
lord
willing
will
be
assured
1jn
323
 
and
this
is
his
commandment
that
we
should
believe
on
the
name
of
his
son
jesus
christ
and
love
one
another
as
he
gave
us
commandment
1jn
324
 
and
he
that
keepeth
his
commandments
dwelleth
in
him
and
he
in
him
and
hereby
we
know
that
he
abideth
in
us
by
the
spirit
which
he
hath
given
us
in
practising
a
good
conscience
we
have
seen
that
we
can
t
have
light
without
knowing
darkness
and
comparably
a
good
conscience
without
knowing
an
evil
conscience
let
s
review
some
everyday
examples
of
us
being
assailed
by
an
evil
conscience
namely
the
seemingly
imperishable
lust
of
the
eyes
the
lust
of
the
flesh
and
the
pride
of
life
in
the
old
covenant
an
evil
conscience
was
somewhat
foreign
to
lust
yet
still
pricked
their
consciences
mat
198
 
he
christ
saith
unto
them
the
apostles
moses
because
of
the
hardness
of
your
hearts
suffered
you
to
put
away
your
wives
but
from
the
beginning
it
was
not
so
mat
199
 
and
i
say
unto
you
whosoever
shall
put
away
his
wife
except
it
be
for
fornication
and
shall
marry
another
committeth
adultery
and
whoso
marrieth
her
which
is
put
away
doth
commit
adultery
 
wow
what
an
indictment
of
a
good
conscience
that
mankind
subliminally
from
the
beginning
as
did
adam
eve
and
cain
at
heart
knew
by
their
subsequent
actions
of
hiding
revealed
an
evil
heart
against
what
constituted
a
good
conscience
mat
527
 
ye
have
heard
that
it
was
said
by
them
of
old
time
thou
shalt
not
commit
adultery
 
mat
528
 
but
i
say
unto
you
that
whosoever
looketh
on
a
woman
to
lust
after
her
hath
committed
adultery
with
her
already
in
his
heart
in
matthew
5
christ
is
instituting
the
spirit
of
keeping
all
his
commandments
resulting
in
growing
a
perfect
conscience
as
he
and
the
father
perpetually
exist
without
contrast
yet
like
cain
and
paul
their
consciences
beheld
a
shadowy
dichotomy
of
a
pricked
conscience
suggesting
something
spiritually
awry
with
that
same
conscience
solomon
who
is
who
we
are
before
knowing
christ
withheld
from
himself
no
lust
as
seen
in
ecclesiastes
210
solomon
and
everyone
under
the
old
covenant
were
blessed
materially
for
their
lawful
dedication
to
loving
god
their
physical
wealth
denoted
their
love
for
god
in
a
shadowy
good
conscience
and
was
evidence
of
their
righteous
living
deu
1126
 
behold
i
the
lord
before
israel
set
before
you
this
day
a
blessing
and
a
curse
deu
1127
 
a
blessing
if
ye
obey
the
commandments
of
the
lord
your
god
which
i
command
you
this
day
and
resulting
good
conscience
deu
1128
 
and
a
curse
if
ye
will
not
obey
the
commandments
of
the
lord
your
god
and
resulting
evil
conscience
but
turn
aside
out
of
the
way
which
i
command
you
this
day
to
go
after
other
gods
which
ye
have
not
known
and
assuredly
a
resulting
evil
conscience
as
earlier
expressed
much
later
achan
under
those
commandments
 
knew
by
his
evil
conscience
that
he
had
done
wrong
since
he
hid
his
treasure
in
the
ground
beneath
his
tent
the
spirit
of
keeping
the
lord
s
commands
was
already
evident
by
the
conviction
of
their
old
covenant
hearts
jesus
being
flesh
lived
in
perfectly
good
conscience
yet
he
knew
that
he
was
subject
to
an
evil
conscience
by
virtue
of
being
tempted
to
acquiesce
with
an
evil
conscience
in
submitting
to
the
devil
s
wiles
evil
was
present
within
his
flesh
as
it
is
in
us
yet
he
didn
t
sin
but
we
do
mar
1018
 
and
jesus
said
unto
him
why
callest
thou
me
good
there
is
none
good
but
one
that
is
god
we
all
as
solomon
if
given
to
honestly
study
our
consciences
would
conclude
that
our
lusts
are
vanity
a
vapour
of
joy
unable
to
be
retained
solomon
came
close
to
understanding
the
misty
conclusion
of
his
polarised
conscience
confusing
him
while
he
did
his
best
to
live
by
the
laws
of
moses
and
yet
knew
some
unidentifiable
spirit
couldn
t
be
grasped
that
missing
something
was
the
unheardof
holy
spirit
that
urges
a
pure
conscience
that
later
in
his
experiences
with
the
shulamite
he
frustratingly
continued
to
see
blackness
christ
s
love
isn
t
awakened
in
solomon
and
the
world
until
he
pleases
in
the
resurrection
to
judgment
son

the
lord
s
double
portion
of
love
in
the
brilliant
light
of
his
word
is
only
awakened
in
his
bride

to
seek
and
search
out
by
wisdom
concerning
all
things
that
are
done
under
heaven
this
sore
travail
hath
god
given
to
the
sons
of
man
to
be
exercised
therewith
life
s
experiences
only
produced
struggles
against
sin
to
be
always
faced
with
the
junction
of
choosing
by
our
lord
s
hand
a
pathway
of
either
a
good
or
evil
conscience
ecc
114
 
i
have
seen
all
the
works
that
are
done
under
the
sun
and
behold
all
is
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
our
works
always
cause
us
to
constantly
be
vexed
by
having
to
choose
the
route
of
a
good
or
evil
conscience
 
ecc
115
 
that
which
is
crooked
cannot
be
made
straight
and
that
which
is
wanting
cannot
be
numbered
we
are
constantly
besieged
by
the
choice
of
a
good
or
evil
pathway
of
conscience
 
pro
218
 
the
way
of
him
that
is
laden
with
guilt
is
exceeding
crooked
but
as
for
the
pure
conscience
his
work
is
right
ecc
116
 
i
communed
with
mine
own
heart
my
conscience
saying
lo
i
am
come
to
great
estate
and
have
gotten
more
wisdom
than
all
they
that
have
been
before
me
in
jerusalem
yea
my
heart
had
great
experience
of
wisdom
and
knowledge
ecc
117
 
and
i
gave
my
heart
to
know
wisdom
and
to
know
madness
and
folly
i
perceived
that
this
also
is
vexation
of
spirit
there
in
that
preceding
verse
is
solomon
s
shulamitelike
vexation
of
knowing
that
unidentifiable
something
we
know
as
the
holy
spirit
was
missing
from
his
vast
wisdom
ecc
118
 
for
in
much
wisdom
is
much
grief
and
he
that
increaseth
knowledge
increaseth
sorrow
 
without
the
holy
spirit
to
prick
our
consciences
when
in
babylon
we
as
did
solomon
experienced
an
indefinable
sorrow
where
immense
physical
prosperity
and
wives
churches
eluded
our
quest
for
peace
and
perfect
joy
always
searching
but
never
coming
to
the
truth
our
dichotic
consciences
increased
sorrow
ecc
29
 
so
i
was
great
and
increased
more
than
all
that
were
before
me
in
jerusalem
also
my
wisdom
remained
with
me
ecc
210
 
and
whatsoever
mine
eyes
desired
i
kept
not
from
them
i
withheld
not
my
heart
from
any
joy
for
my
heart
rejoiced
in
all
my
labour
and
this
was
my
portion
of
all
my
labour
there
is
some
truth
that
in
good
conscience
particularly
solomon
in
his
time
and
remnants
of
us
in
babylon
believe
that
it
is
our
right
to
pursue
any
joy
of
the
flesh
as
long
as
we
use
our
“
wisdom
”
to
not
directly
contravene
christ
s
laws
the
major
snag
is
that
riches
afford
unrestrained
pursuit
of
pleasure
so
the
more
powerful
bias
is
to
love
them
more
than
our
lord
s
greater
riches
of
his
commandments
gal
516
 
this
i
say
then
walk
in
the
spirit
and
ye
shall
not
fulfil
the
lust
of
the
flesh
 
gal
517
 
for
the
flesh
lusteth
against
the
spirit
and
the
spirit
against
the
flesh
and
these
are
contrary
the
one
to
the
other
so
that
ye
cannot
do
the
things
that
ye
would
luk
1426
 
if
any
man
come
to
me
and
hate
not
his
father
and
mother
and
wife
and
children
and
brethren
and
sisters
yea
and
his
own
life
also
he
cannot
be
my
disciple
 
luk
1427
 
and
whosoever
doth
not
bear
his
cross
and
come
after
me
cannot
be
my
disciple
mat
1929
 
and
every
one
that
hath
forsaken
houses
or
brethren
or
sisters
or
father
or
mother
or
wife
or
children
or
lands
for
my
name
s
sake
shall
receive
an
hundredfold
and
shall
inherit
everlasting
life
with
an
elusive
shulamitelike
epiphany
solomon
was
further
vexed
by
his
conscience
with
classic
introspection
he
says
 
ecc
211
 
then
i
looked
on
all
the
works
that
my
hands
had
wrought
and
on
the
labour
that
i
had
laboured
to
do
and
behold
all
was
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
and
there
was
no
profit
under
the
sun
how
utterly
frustrating
it
is
in
babylon
when
a
mist
of
christ
s
spirit
for
the
most
part
veils
our
conscience
when
given
a
stephenlike
revelation
upon
keeping
all
the
commandments
of
god
a
good
conscience
hailstones
our
understanding
washing
away
the
multitude
of
lies
and
outshining
all
vexations
of
darkness
probably
the
most
exceptional
lust
for
a
male
is
what
is
highlighted
in
being
taken
out
of
him
in
the
form
of
a
woman
if
the
majority
of
his
femininity
wasn
t
placed
in
front
of
him
in
the
form
of
eve
to
see
himself
he
would
have
had
only
a
vague
solomonlike
understanding
of
his
evil
nature
being
facetoface
with
his
own
flesh
is
highly
arousing
to
lust
for
all
kinds
of
spiritual
ethnicities
as
did
solomon
and
us
with
captivating
doctrines
while
not
understanding
that
they
all
represent
the
same
ruling
deception
a
man
s
wife
mirrors
himself
as
having
a
heart
that
ensnares
his
conscience
with
evil
and
fetters
his
hands
to
excuse
himself
and
hide
from
sin
ecc

she
is
the
reflection
of
his
narcissism
and
he
is
unwittingly
taken
by
his
own
beauty
having
ascended
to
heaven
unconsciously
to
presume
a
dethroning
of
god
while
pricked
by
a
good
conscience
he
is
so
easily
led
away
by
his
lust

conceit

more

passion

famished

we
always
have
time
to
reflect
upon
our
choice
of
conscience
if
a
semblance
of
righteousness
resides
we
should
be
stabbed
through

liver
with
an
evil
conscience

fully
considering

commandments

this
case
choosing
a

conscience

is

when

the
famous
german
philosopher
friedrich
nietzsche
said
“
a
bad
conscience
is
easier
to
cope
with
than
a
bad
reputation
”
 
why
because
a
bad
conscience
is
mostly
contrived
in
secret
whereas
a
bad
reputation
is
humiliating
and
mostly
for
everyone
to
see
we
are
more
likely
to
fear
another
s
condemnation
rather
than
god
s
since
god
seems
far
off
and
not
in
our
faces
it
is
easier
in
the
short
term
to
hide
a
bad
reputation
even
with
having
to
live
with
the
amplification
of
an
evil
conscience
forever
pro
910
 
the
fear
of
the
lord
is
the
beginning
of
wisdom
and

knowledge
of

holy

hearts
may

we
can
accuse

run

hide
all
we
like

an
evil
conscience

are
guaranteed
to
face
the
music

the

in

is
moral
conscience
body
discuss
the
role
of
moral
conscience
in
ethical
behaviour
conclusion
way
forward
 
moral
conscience
 
is
a
part
of
the
cognitive
process
in
mind
that
tells
whether
an
act
is
morally
right
or
wrong
in
other
words
it
is
awareness
of
moral
principles
and
whether
act
done
is
in
accordance
with
these
principles
or
not
it
is
an
instrument
for
selfcontrol
correction
and
regulation
the
proper
understanding
of
the
moral
conscience
is
basic
to
our
understanding
of
morality
and
to
an
ethical
conduct
role
of
moral
conscience
in
ethical
behaviour
1
right
choices
human
actions
entail
free
decisions
concerning
ends
and
means
these
actions
have
an
ethical
dimension
because
they
concern
making
right
choices
based
on
the
analysis
of
the
nature
of
acts
and
the
intentions
and
circumstances
that
are
involved
moral
conscience
help
guide
people
to
follow
the
right
means
to
a
right
end
2
inner
guide
moral
conscience
is
our
inner
guide
and
it
helps
you
figure
out
how
to
make
good
choices
as
we
grow
up
we
learn
right
from
wrong
our
moral
conscience
is
the
thought
and
feeling
we
have
that
tells
us
whether
something
is
a
right
or
wrong
thing
to
do
or
say
thus
it
is
a
consistent
guide
to
ethical
decision
making
3
source
of
information
the
moral
conscience
is
considered
the
proximate
norm
of
conduct
because
it
is
the
immediate
source
of
information
guiding
human
actions
it
directs
human
actions
so
that
a
person
can
transcend
his
animal
instincts
and
human
inclinations
moral
conscience
allows
man
to
exercise
reason
and
thus
allow
an
objective
decision
and
act
based
on
right
values
4
decision
making
without
moral
conscience
a
person
would
doubt
even
the
smallest
decisions
since
the
judgment
of
moral
conscience
is
a
judgment
about
how
an
action
conforms
or
does
not
conform
to
natural
law
then
it
is
obligatory
to
act
according
to
one
s
conscience
although
there
are
persons
who
have
a
doubtful
conscience
which
renders
them
unable
to
decide
upon
actions
easily
a
wellformed
moral
conscience
is
effective
because
it
makes
practical
judgments
with
relative
ease
or
after
seeking
necessary
advice
5
resolving
ethical
dilemmas
a
human
being
always
comes
across
ethical
dilemmas
in
the
decision
making
process
moral
conscience
acts
as
the
guide
for
taking
correct
decisions
when
we
have
to
choose
between
competing
sets
of
principles
in
a
given
usually
undesirable
or
perplexing
situation
example
 
helping
accident
victims
on
your
way
to
an
interview
6
rational
decision
through
our
individual
moral
conscience
one
becomes
aware
of
his
deeply
held
moral
principles
and
motivates
accordingly
to
act
upon
those
principles
removing
conflicts
as
we
assess
our
character
our
behaviour
and
ultimately
our
self
against
those
principles
conscience
leads
to
proper
analysis
of
good
and
bad
of
the
situation
and
proper
evaluation
of
various
options
7
ethical
awareness
this
is
our
ability
to
recognise
ethical
values
and
principles
the
moral
conscience
enables
the
human
mind
to
understand
the
world
in
moral
terms
this
enhances
our
ability
to
make
practical
decisions
in
light
of
ethical
values
and
principles
8
conscientious
objection
the
conscientious
objection
is
very
important
in
public
services
tostay
impartial
it
is
important
that
public
servants
must
object
to
any
favours
and
corrupt
activities
moral
conscience
helps
in
conscientious
objection
by
making
an
individual
aware
of
the
impact
of
his
decisions
on
larger
public
limitation
of
moral
conscience
in
ethical
behaviour
1
individuality
moral
conscience
is
highly
personal
and
varies
with
individuals
for
example
a
person
might
think
killing
muslim
as
moral
in
order
to
take
revenge
in
his
conscience
it
is
moral
to
kill
muslim
and
help
hindu
cause
2
social
norms
moral
conscience
is
guided
by
the
social
norms
in
general
it
can
impact
the
ethical
thinking
of
an
individual
leading
to
unethical
behaviour
for
example
in
islamic
countries
many
are
misguided
in
name
of
jihad
and
act
of
terrorism
is
held
moral
and
as
an
act
of
sacrifice
for
the
cause
of
religion
3
courage
despite
being
morally
conscience
about
what
is
right
an
individual
might
lack
courage
to
act
ethically
for
example
a
civil
servant
might
know
that
his
colleague
is
taking
bribes
he
may
not
act
consciously
due
to
fear
of
political
links
that
his
colleague
has
4
other
factors
many
other
factors
like
honesty
values
education
etc
define
an
individual
s
morals
thus
one
might
not
know
what
he
is
doing
is
immoral
for
example
a
person
might
beat
his
wife
as
in
his
conscience
mind
it
is
not
immoral
due
to
patriarchal
mindset
thus
the
moral
conscience
plays
an
important
role
in
making
moral
decisions
and
actions
the
reason
behind
conscience
as
the
ultimate
highest
determiner
of
moral
action
and
its
authority
is
the
idea
that
when
conscience
and
all
other
principles
are
properly
understood
they
promote
and
motivate
us
to
act
that
are
in
accordance
with
our
nature

few
novelists
have
captured
the
ultimate
ambiguity
of
conscience
better
than
mark
twain
did
in
huckleberry
finn
jim
the
escaped
slave
who
accompanies
huck
down
the
river
on
a
raft
is
on
a
journey
to
reunite
with
his
beloved
family
whom
white
people
have
separated
from
him
in
several
scenes
huck
beset
with
guilt
for
not
handing
jim
over
to
the
authorities
as
his
conscience
naggingly
instructs
him
to
anguishes
over
his
default
role
as
an
escapee
s
accomplice
finally
subconsciously
recognizing
jim
not
only
as
the
devoted
concerned
father
figure
he
never
had
but
in
many
ways
as
a
paragon
of
virtue
despite
the
color
of
his
skin
huck
decides
to
disobey
his
conscience
in
doing
so
he
demonstrates
the
courage
many
literary
critics
have
cited
as
constituting
the
novel
s
moral
climax
i
was
atrembling
because
i
d
got
to
decide
forever
betwixt
two
things
and
i
knowed
it
i
studied
a
minute
sort
of
holding
my
breath
and
then
says
to
myself
alright
then
i
ll
go
to
hell
in
addition
note
these
two
later
passages
which
also
explain
indirectly
why
twain
would
have
readers
question
the
racist
messages
endemic
to
a
prejudicial
society
it
don
t
make
no
difference
whether
you
do
right
or
wrong
a
person
s
conscience
ain
t
got
no
sense
and
just
goes
for
him
anyway
but
because
huck
isn
t
yet
mature
or
freethinking
enough
to
triumph
over
the
cultural
bias
of
the
culture
that
s
educated
him
he
s
compelled
to
rationalize
his
decision
to
protect
jim
through
some
curious
verbal
gymnastics
namely
i
knowed
he
jim
was
white
inside
to
employ
freud
s
terminology
huck
is
coming
from
his
id
doing
what
by
nature
he
s
drawn
to
do
while
forcefully
resisting
the
strong
gravitational
pull
of
his
guiltinducing
superego
but
when
these
brief
excerpts
are
explored
in
the
context
of
twain
s
general
handling
of
whites
in
the
novel
it
s
obvious
that
as
traditionally
understood
twain
has
interchanged
id
and
superego
metaphorically
that
is
the
connotations
of
whiteness
are
quite
black
—
and
black
ironically
has
been
transposed
with
white
what
twain
characterizes
is
that
a
slave
can
exemplify
all
that
s
most
admirable
in
humanity
while
the
purportedly
most
lilywhite
individuals
may
indeed
illustrate
the
reverse
for
huck
to
act
conscientiously
by
denying
jim
his
personal
freedom
—
which
despite
tremendous
personal
risks
jim
so
desperately
seeks
because
of
his
dedication
to
his
wife
and
children
—
would
be
to
mirror
his
society
s
corrupted
conscience
huck
s
safeguarding
of
jim
from
all
the
people
who
d
prefer
primarily
for
ignoble
reasons
to
return
him
to
slavery
can
be
comprehended
as
depicting
a
true
versus
an
artificial
culturallyderived
conscience
ernest
hemingway
deeply
influenced
by
twain
s
plainspoken
style
and
exemplifying
a
similar
interest
in
discovering
how
best
to
distinguish
between
virtuous
and
villainous
behavior
offers
this
realitybased
solution
in
death
in
the
afternoon
what
is
moral
is
what
you
feel
good
after
and
what
is
immoral
is
what
you
feel
bad
after
here
too
we
re
presented
with
an
idealistically
pragmatic
perspective
deviating
from
the
far
more
conventional
morals
or
mores
of
society
hemingway
s
position
is
that
deciding
how
to
evaluate
the
ethical
ramifications
of
behavior
ought
to
be
based
on
personal
realityderived
sentiment
it
s
a
matter
of
trusting
one
s
authentic
feelings
rather
than
what
one
has
absorbed
unconsciously
both
from
how
their
family
raised
them
and
the
moral
consensus
of
their
culture
ethics
and
morality
essential
reads
becoming
a
better
person
takes
time
the
mental
health
struggles
of
veterinary
technicians
writers
worldwide
have
historically
questioned
popular
assumptions
about
the
fixed
nature
of
good
and
evil
so
these
two
authors
can
be
seen
as
representative
of
so
many
writers
who
came
to
regard
accepted
definitions
of
morality
as
simplistic
—
and
frequently
false
defining
conscience
from
a
religious
perspective
let
s
now
look
at
customary
definitions
of
conscience
to
illustrate
how
they
stop
short
of
accounting
for
the
many
ambiguities
so
often
found
in
reality
for
what
s
ideal
and
what
s
practically
possible
can
at
times
be
worlds
apart
—
as
can
the
gulf
between
what
people
aspire
to
and
what
they
re
actually
capable
of
the
literature
online
relating
particularly
to
the
oxymoronic
concept
of
an
evil
conscience
emanates
mostly
from
theology
—
and
we
ll
deal
with
this
orientation
first
the
approach
that
fundamentalist
religion
takes
toward
ethics
is
absolutist
placing
a
person
s
behavior
into
neat
generally
unqualified
categories
for
example
in
a
sermon
marshaling
all
of
its
supporting
evidence
from
scriptures
greg
stuckey
defines
any
human
wrongdoing
as
—
purely
and
simply
—
evil
so
anyone
afflicted
with
such
a
presumed
immoral
conscience
will
experience
as
good
what
the
bible
delineates
as
evil
and
vice
versa
defining
such
people
as
sociopathic
though
without
employing
this
secular
terminology
stuckey
posits
that
they
glory
in
and
brag
about
precisely
what
they
should
be
ashamed
of
rather
than
feeling
troubled
by
hurting
others
they
perversely
take
joy
in
it
looked
at
from
this
dogmatic
ecclesiastical
stance
an
evil
conscience
is
synonymous
with
sinning
against
god
—
and
it
requires
paying
penance
to
god
if
one
is
to
be
forgiven
in
my
next
post
i
ll
explore
this
seminal
topic
from
a
secular
point
of
view
and
also
explore
the
curious
moral
ambiguity
of
the
superego
and
my
final
post
on
this
subject
will
get
into
the
moral
rationalizations
people
offer
for
bad
behavior
which

the
evil
conscience
“
let
us
draw
near
with
a
sincere
heart
in
full
assurance
of
faith
having
our
hearts
sprinkled
clean
from
an
evil
conscience
and
our
bodies
washed
with
pure
water
”
hebrews
1022
how
could
this
be
a
conscience
that
is
evil
the
traditionalists
are
going
to
faint
when
they
hear
about
this
could
it
be
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
conscience
that
directs
man
to
do
what
is
evil
instead
of
what
is
good
absolutely
just
as
it
is
possible
to
have
a
broken
compass
that
points
east
instead
of
north
the
old
testament
talks
about
men
whose
hearts
desired
nothing
but
evil
continually
genesis
65
these
men
were
later
annihilated
by
the
flood
think
about
sodom
and
gomorrah
do
you
think
those
guys
were
interested
in
doing
what
was
right
based
on
their
conscience
they
were
only
interested
in
sex
with
any
man
or
woman
they
could
find
don
t
be
surprised
this
is
what
the
heart
mind
and
conscience
of
man
can
degenerate
into
 
the
conscience
of
man
can
be
such
that
instead
of
leading
you
to
do
what
is
right
it
leads
you
to
do
what
is
evil
again
like
the
seared
conscience
you
can
either
develop
an
evil
conscience
or
be
born
with
it
the
difference
between
the
seared
and
evil
conscience
is
that
a
seared
conscience
is
devoid
of
guilt
or
without
regret
from
doing
what
is
wrong
or
the
conscience
itself
is
silent
an
evil
conscience
however
directs
the
heart
of
man
towards
evil
instead
of
good
doing
the
opposite
of
what
a
normal
functioning
conscience
would
do
 
in
theory
a
good
conscience
keeps
us
from
doing
wrong
because
it
is
a
voice
within
that
directs
us
towards
the
right
action
an
evil
conscience
desires
for
us
to
do
what
is
wrong
constantly
and
because
of
this
desire
there
is
no
guilt
associated
with
committing
whatever
evil
deed
your
heart
desires
 
you
would
be
surprised
to
hear
that
such
a
conscience
is
actually
quite
prevalent
in
the
church
because
it
is
easy
to
do
evil
and
still
walk
into
the
assembly
like
there
is
nothing
wrong
this
is
popular
at
highly
liberal
churches
which
i
tend
to
call
“
adulterer
s
haven
”
churches
because
many
of
them
ignore
the
teachings
of
christ
on
divorce
and
remarriage
and
allow
anyone
with
an
unscriptural
marriage
to
enter
their
assembly
 
an
evil
conscience
will
keep
you
sinning
and
give
you
no
reason
to
change
all
the
popular
 
tools
of
change
endorsed
by
the
church
guiltshameconsciencefear
have
been
taken
out
of
your
toolbelt
according
to
them
you
will
not
be
able
to
progress
without
an
overwhelming
sense
of
guilt
how
will
you
change
 
this
statement
gives
you
a
bird
s
eye
view
into
their
ignorance
of
the
subject
no
emotion
is
necessary
for
change
to
occur
even
though
emotions
can
help
on
the
path
of
change
however
guilt
is
uncommon
for
men
as
it
tends
to
be
primarily
a
female
emotion
or
one
experienced
by
weak
betamales
 
men
you
must
grow
train
progress
and
improve
with
or
without
emotional
help
few
modern
men
know
this
you
aren
t
going
to
feel
like
going
to
work
every
day
no
one
does
but
you
go
anyway
no
one
is
going
to
feel
like
working
out

day
but
you
do
it
anyways
no
man
is
going
to
feel
like
listening
to
and
loving
their
wife
every
day
but
they
do
it
men
take
action
regardless
of
how
they
feel
at
the
time
regardless
of
all
emotion
men
must
press
on
and
do
what
is
right
they
must
work
improve
train
and
move
towards
being
the
fully
formed
and

evil
conscience
application
if
you
have
an
evil
conscience
you
must
do
the
opposite
of
what
your
conscience
tells
you
to
do
it
is
as
simple
as
that
if
your
conscience
is
evil
it
is
pulling
you
towards
evil
action
so
you
must
resist
your
conscience
and
oppose
it
in
order
to
do
what
is
right
again
it
does
not
matter
if
you
feel
like
doing
what
is
right
or
if
you
want
to
or
what
your
motivation
is
it
only
matters
if
you
do
what
is
right
or
not
what
are
your
actions
they
can
be
good
or
evil
regardless
of
what
kind
of
conscience
you
have
 
again
and
at
risk
of
being
overly
redundant
reject
the
idea
of
the
necessity
of
conscience
 
conscience
is
a
tool
to
be
used
for
change
but
change
is
possible
without
this
tool
this
is
a
principle
fact
of
life
you
must
do
what
is
right
regardless
of
emotional
states
including
the
emotional
state
of
a
conscience
you
must
focus
and
take
action
do
what
is

conscience
describes
two
things
–
what
a
person
believes
is
right
and
how
a
person
decides
what
is
right
more
than
just
gut
instinct
our
conscience
is
a
moral
muscle
by
informing
us
of
our
 
values
and
principles
it
becomes
the
standard
we
use
to
judge
whether
or
not
our
actions
are
ethical
we
can
call
these
two
roles
ethical
awareness
and
ethical
decision
making
ethical
awareness
this
is
our
ability
to
recognise
ethical
values
and
principles
the
medieval
philosopher
 
thomas
aquinas
 
believed
our
conscience
emerged
from
 
synderesis
the
spark
of
conscience
he
literally
meant
the
human
mind
s
ability
to
understand
the
world
in
moral
terms
conscience
was
the
process
by
which
a
person
brought
the
principles
of
 
synderesis
 
into
a
practical
situation
through
our
decisions
ethical
decision
making
this
is
our
ability
to
make
practical
decisions
informed
by
ethical
values
and
principles
in
his
writings
aristotle
described
 
phronesis
the
goodness
of
practical
reason
this
was
the
ability
to
evaluate
a
situation
clearly
so
we
would
know
how
to
act
virtuously
under
the
circumstances
a
conscience
which
is
both
well
formed
shaped
by
education
and
experience
and
well
informed
aware
of
facts
evidence
and
so
on
enables
us
to
know
ourselves
and
our
world
and
act
accordingly
seeing
conscience
in
this
way
is
important
because
it
teaches
us
ethics
is
not
innate
by
continuously
working
to
understand
our
surroundings
we
strengthen
our
moral
muscle
conscientious
objection
in
politics
much
of
the
debate
around
conscience
concerns
the
 
“
right
to
 
conscientious
objection
”
should
prolife
doctors
be
required
to
perform
abortions
or
refer
patients
to
doctors
who
will
must
priests
break
the
confessional
seal
and
report
sex
offenders
who
confess
to
them
can
pacifists
be
excused
from
conscription
because
of
their
opposition
to
war
for
a
long
time
western
nations
informed
by
the
catholic
intellectual
tradition
believed
in
the
“
primacy
of
conscience
”
–
the
idea
that
a
person
should
never
be
forced
to
do
something
they
believe
is
against
their
most
deeply
held
values
and
principles
in
recent
times
particularly
in
medicine
this
has
come
to
be
questioned
australian
bioethicist
 
julian
savulescu
 
believes
doctors
working
in
the
public
system
should
be
 
banned
from
objecting
 
to
procedures
because
it
compromises
patient
care
this
debate
sees
a
clash
between
two
worldviews
–
one
where
people
s
foremost
responsibility
is
to
their
own
personal
beliefs
about
what
is
good
and
right
and
another
where
this
duty
is
balanced
against
the
needs
of
the
common
good
philosopher
 
michael
walzer
 
believes
there
are
situations
where
you
have
a
duty
to
“
get
your
hands
dirty
”
–
even
if
the
price
is
your
own
sense
of
goodness
in
response
aristotle
might
have
said
“
no
person
wishes
to
possess
the
world
if
they
must
first
become
someone
else
”
that
is
we
can
t
change
who
we
are
or
what
we
believe
in
for
any
price

aquinas
natural
moral
law
aquinas
developed
natural
law
as
a
form
of
religious
ethics
natural
law
is
the
theory
that
god
has
designed
a
moral
law
into
human
nature
such
that
we
are
naturally
inclined
to
certain
moral
behaviours
ethics
is
therefore
about
using
reason
to
discover
the
natural
law
within
our
nature
so
that
we
can
conform
our
actions
to
it
in
order
to
fulfil
our
purpose
telos
of
glorifying
god
by
following
his
law
the
primary
precepts
synderesis
aquinas
claims
that
reason
is
a
power
of
the
human
soul
and
synderesis
is
the
habit
or
ability
of
reason
to
discover
foundational
first
principles
of
god
s
natural
moral
law
which
gives
us
insight
into
god
s
intentions
for
human
life
and
thus
our
telos
“
the
first
practical
principles
belong
to
a
special
natural
habit
which
we
call
“
synderesis
”
is
said
to
incite
to
good
and
to
murmur
at
evil
inasmuch
as
through
first
principles
we
proceed
to
discover
and
judge
of
what
we
have
discovered
”
the
first
principle
synderesis
tells
us
is
called
the
synderesis
rule
that
the
good
is
what
all
things
seek
as
their
endgoal
telos
this
means
that
human
nature
has
an
innate
orientation
to
the
good
“
this
therefore
is
the
principle
of
law
that
good
must
be
done
and
evil
avoided
”
in
addition
to
this
synderesis
tells
us
the
primary
precepts
worship
god
live
in
an
orderly
society
reproduce
educate
protect
and
preserve
human
life
and
defend
the
innocent
these
primary
precepts
are
the
articulation
of
the
orientations
in
our
nature
toward
the
good
the
natural
inclinations
of
our
goddesigned
human
nature
put
into
the
form
of
ethical
principles
by
human
reason
secondary
precepts
conscientia
the
primary
precepts
are
applied
to
situations
or
types
of
actions
–
a
process
called
conscientia
the
judgement
we
then
acquire
is
a
secondary
precept
e
g
euthanasia
the
primary
precepts
don
t
say
anything
about
euthanasia
exactly
but
we
can
use
our
reason
to
apply
the
primary
precepts
to
euthanasia
and
realise
that
it
goes
against
the
primary
precept
of
protecting
and
preserving
human
life
arguably
it
even
disrupts
the
functioning
of
society
too
therefore
we
can
conclude
the
secondary
precept
that
euthanasia
is
wrong
aquinas
view
of
the
conscience
natural
law
is
aquinas
theory
on
how
god
is
the
grounding
and
source
of
morality
conscience
is
about
the
human
psychology
involved
in
understanding
and
applying
natural
moral
law
conscience
is
ratio
reason
used
to
understand
and
apply
god
s
natural
law
aquinas
claims
that
the
classic
features
of
conscience
follow
from
the
application
of
our
knowledge
of
the
natural
moral
law
to
our
moral
actions
in
three
ways
1
witness
–
by
knowing
whether
we
have
done
or
not
done
something
2
bind
incite
–
“
through
the
conscience
we
judge
that
something
should
be
done
or
not
done
”
3
accuse
torment
rebuke
–
“
by
conscience
we
judge
that
something
done
is
well
done
or
ill
done
”
this
is
how
the
conscience
causes
guilt
conscience
is
our
ability
to
know
whether
we
have
done
something
whether
we
should
have
done
it
and
whether
it
was
done
well
if
we
have
done
something
wrong
our
conscience
will
accuse
torment
and
rebuke
us
–
causing
feelings
of
guilt
because
human
reason
is
fallible
the
conscience
thereby
becomes
fallible
we
could
be
mistaken
for
example
when
we
don
t
 
know
how
a
general
rule
applies
to
a
certain
situation
mistake
in
conscientia
aquinas
claims
that
the
synderesis
rule
and
the
primary
precepts
cannot
be
mistaken
or
lost
from
the
human
mind
however
mistakes
can
be
made
in
conscientia
–
the
application
of
the
primary
precepts
to
moral
situations
or
actions
to
derive
secondary
precepts
these
mistakes
can
result
from
original
sin
unvirtuous
habits
and
corrupt
culture
“
as
to
those
general
principles
the
natural
law
in
the
abstract
can
nowise
be
blotted
out
from
men
s
hearts
but
as
to
the
secondary
precepts
the
natural
law
can
be
blotted
out
from
the
human
heart
either
by
evil
persuasions
just
as
in
speculative
matters
errors
occur
in
respect
of
necessary
conclusions
or
by
vicious
customs
and
corrupt
habits
”
real
vs
apparent
goods
we
might
reason
that
something
is
in
accord
with
our
nature
s
goal
and
is
thus
good
when
really
is
not
such
actions
are
called
apparent
goods
because
they
only
appear
good
to
someone
engaged
in
faulty
reasoning
they
are
not
real
goods
despite
this
potential
for
our
conscience
judging
something
bad
to
be
good
aquinas
still
insists
we
must
follow
it
“
every
judgment
of
conscience
be
it
right
or
wrong
is
obligatory
he
who
acts
against
his
conscience
always
sins
”
this
is
because
if
you
choose
to
act
against
your
conscience
then
you
are
choosing
to
do
something
you
believe
to
be
evil
conscience
is
thus
always
binding
vincible
vs
invincible
ignorance
whether
errors
in
conscience
that
lead
to
sinful
acts
will
be
forgiven
or
pardoned
depends
on
the
type
of
ignorance
that
caused
the
error
invincible
ignorance
involves
circumstances
where
a
person
could
not
have
known
better
and
so
are
not
to
blame
for
their
action
for
example
if
someone
drunkenly
jumps
in
front
of
your
car
and
there
was
nothing
you
could
have
done
you
would
not
be
held
responsible
for
hitting
them
actions
that
go
against
the
natural
law
but
are
done
due
to
invincible
ignorance
are
technically
not
voluntary
and
thus
not
sin
“
it
is
not
imputed
as
a
sin
to
man
if
he
fails
to
know
what
he
is
unable
to
know
consequently
ignorance
of
such
like
things
is
called
invincible
”
vincible
ignorance
involves
circumstances
where
a
person
could
have
known
better
and
so
are
to
blame
for
their
action
it
typically
involves
some
kind
of
negligence
or
ignorance
of
which
moral
principle
is
relevant
to
a
situation
for
example
if
a
fire
breaks
out
in
a
building
because
it
wasn
t
looked
after
properly
then
the
person
in
charge
of
that
is
to
blame
for
their
action
they
were
ignorant
that
the
fire
would
happen
but
they
should
have
known
better
actions
that
go
against
the
natural
law
done
out
of
vincible
ignorance
are
sins
because
we
should
have
known
better
“
invincible
ignorance
not
being
voluntary
since
it
is
not
in
our
power
to
be
rid
of
it
is
not
a
sin
on
the
other
hand
vincible
ignorance
is
a
sin
if
it
be
about
matters
one
is
bound
to
know
”
arguably
aquinas
is
too
optimistic
about
human
nature
if
you
consider
the
terrible
things
that
humans
have
done
and
that
entire
cultures
have
embraced
e
g
slavery
and
nazism
it
starts
to
look
like
human
nature
is
not
as
positive
as
aquinas
thought
if
we
really
had
an
orientation
towards
the
good
and
the
primary
precepts
accurately
described
our
nature
s
orientation
then
we
should
not
expect
to
find
the
extent
of
human
evil
we
do
however
aquinas
claim
is
merely
that
human
nature
contains
an
orientation
towards
the
good
it
doesn
t
involve
a
commitment
to
humans
actually
doing
more
good
than
evil
nor
to
incredibly
evil
acts
or
cultures
occurring
infrequently
aquinas
acknowledges
that
there
are
many
reasons
we
might
fail
to
do
good
despite
having
an
orientation
towards
it
these
include
original
sin
mistakes
in
conscientia
lacking
virtue
and
a
corrupt
culture
the
fact
that
humanity
could
sink
so
low
as
to
produce
nazism
and
the
holocaust
is
strong
evidence
against
the
human
nature
having
an
orientation
toward
the
good
descriptive
moral
relativism
aquinas
was
not
as
aware
of
different
cultures
as
we
are
today
as
we
now
know
thanks
to
modern
anthropology
there
are
vastly
different
moral
beliefs
across
cultures
this
is
called
descriptive
moral
relativism
fletcher
made
the
argument
that
this
could
be
taken
as
evidence
that
there
is
not
an
innate
godgiven
ability
of
reason
to
discover
the
natural
law
since
then
we
should
expect
more
moral
agreement
freud
would
argue
that
it
is
society
which
conditions
our
moral
views
there
either
is
no
natural
moral
law
or
human
reason
is
unable
to
discover
it
so
what
aquinas
thought
was
human
nature
was
really
just
his
culture
however
there
do
seem
to
be
some
core
similarities
between
the
moralities
of
different
cultures
such
as
not
killing
for
no
reason
and
rules
about
stealing
reproduction
and
education
are
also
universal
moral
thinkers
from
different
cultures
came
up
with
similar
moral
prescriptions
such
as
the
golden
rule
to
treat
others
as
you
would
like
to
be
treated
which
can
be
found
in
ancient
chinese
philosophy
hinduism
judaism
and
christianity
this
could
be
taken
to
show
that
moral
views
are
determined
by
a
universal
human
moral
nature
alternative
explanation
these
crosscultural
similarities
in
moral
codes
might
have
resulted
from
a
biologically
evolved
morality
rather
than
one
designed
by
a
god
however
which
would
mean
it
is
not
related
to
a
telos
designed
by
god
alternatively
crosscultural
morality
might
result
merely
from
the
basic
requirement
of
a
society
to
function
if
anyone
could
kill
or
steal
from
anyone
else
for
no
reason
whenever
they
wanted
it
s
hard
to
see
how
a
society
could
exist
that
might
create
an
existential
pressure
which
influences
the
moral
thinkers
of
a
society
yielding
prescriptions
such
as
the
golden
rule
crosscultural
ethics
therefore
has
a
practical
reality
as
its
basis
not
god
and
not
or
not
only
evolution
aquinas
natural
theology
aquinas
believed
that
human
reason
could
never
know
or
understand
god
however
aquinas
is
a
proponent
of
natural
theology
through
reason
which
he
claimed
could
support
faith
in
god
human
reason
can
gain
knowledge
of
god
s
natural
moral
law
through
the
ability
of
human
reason
to
know
the
synderesis
rule
and
primary
precepts
karl
barth
argued
that
aquinas
natural
law
theory
was
a
false
natural
theology
which
placed
a
dangerous
overreliance
on
human
reason
barth
argued
that
if
humans
were
able
to
know
god
or
god
s
morality
through
their
own
efforts
then
revelation
would
be
unnecessary
yet
god
clearly
thought
revelation
necessary
as
he
sent
jesus
barth
also
argued
that
“
the
finite
has
no
capacity
for
the
infinite
”
our
finite
minds
cannot
grasp
god
s
infinite
being
whatever
humans
discover
through
reason
is
therefore
not
divine
so
to
think
it
is
must
then
amount
to
idolatry
–
the
worship
of
earthly
things
barth
argued
idolatry
can
lead
to
worship
of
nations
and
then
even
to
movements
like
the
nazis
it
follows
for
barth
that
after
the
corruption
of
the
fall
human
reason
cannot
reach
god
or
figure
out
right
and
wrong
by
itself
only
faith
in
god
s
revelation
in
the
bible
is
valid
in
defence
of
aquinas
he
is
not
suggesting
that
our
finite
minds
can
understand
god
s
nature
or
goodness
eternal
law
aquinas
is
only
suggesting
that
reason
can
understand
the
natural
law
god
created
within
our
nature
if
reason
only
has
this
goal
of
supporting
faith
in
such
ways
then
it
cannot
make
revealed
theology
unnecessary
 
tillich
defends
aquinas
to
a
degree
arguing
that
barth
was
too
negative
in
denying
the
possibility
of
reason
discovering
anything
whatsoever
of
the
natural
law
“
there
is
selfdeception
in
every
denial
of
the
natural
moral
law
the
very
statement
that
man
is
estranged
from
his
created
nature
presupposes
an
experience
of
the
abyss
between
what
he
essentially
is
and
what
is
existentially
is
even
a
weak
or
misled
conscience
is
still
a
conscience
namely
the
silent
voice
of
man
s
own
essential
nature
judging
his
actual
being
”
–
tillich
to
deny
that
our
conscience
can
discover
the
natural
law
is
to
claim
that
there
is
a
gap
between
what
we
currently
are
and
what
we
could
be
yet
to
have
an
awareness
of
that
gap
is
to
have
a
conscience
that
is
aware
of
its
fallen
state
so
it
is
contradictory
to
deny
the
natural
law
even
it
now
involves
a
weakened
conscience
that
still
tells
us
at
least
something
of
the
direction
we
have
fallen
in
and
the
direction
back
towards
righteousness
however
whatever
a
weak
and
misled
conscience
discovers
is
surely
not
god
s
morality
humanity
believing
it
has
the
ability
to
know
anything
of
god
is
the
same
arrogance
that
caused
adam
and
eve
to
disobey
god
humanity
believing
that
it
has
the
power
to
figure
out
right
and
wrong
is
what
led
to
the
arrogant
certainty
of
the
nazis
in
their
own
superiority
the
arrogance
of
natural
theology
is
evidence
of
a
human
inability
to
be
humble
enough
to
simply
have
faith
psychological
views
on
the
conscience
sigmund
freud
freud
thought
the
conscience
was
just
the
result
of
psychological
forces
that
science
could
understand
freud
believed
the
mind
was
divided
into
the
id
our
unconscious
animalistic
desires
ego
our
conscious
decisionmaking
self
and
the
super
ego
the
part
of
us
that
“
stores
”
the
values
we
introjected
unconsciously
adopted
from
authority
figures
during
childhood
and
is
the
source
of
our
moral
feelings
when
a
desire
bubbles
up
from
the
unconscious
id
into
our
conscious
ego
we
become
aware
of
wanting
to
act
on
it
but
our
super
ego
then
tells
us
whether
the
values
of
our
society
allow
it
if
so
we
can
act
on
it
if
not
we
have
been
conditioned
to
repress
that
desire
which
freud
thought
responsible
for
many
mental
problems
the
ethical
implications
is
that
conscience
is
not
the
voice
of
god
in
us
it
is
just
what
our
society
wants
from
us
our
society
might
be
good
or
bad
therefore
our
conscience
is
not
the
best
guide
if
freud
is
right
furthermore
there
might
not
even
be
a
good
or
bad
if
morality
is
merely
the
conditioning
of
societies
on
its
members
freud
was
influenced
by
nietzsche
who
argued
that
human
conscious
mind
what
freud
called
the
ego
developed
by
necessity
when
humans
underwent
the
radical
change
from
huntergatherer
to
farmer
our
natural
animalistic
instincts
what
freud
called
the
id
were
of
less
use
to
us
in
the
new
environment
of
society
in
fact
they
were
a
hinderance
as
they
called
on
us
to
behave
in
ways
that
would
make
society
fall
apart
consciousness
emerged
as
the
space
inbetween
our
instincts
and
the
outside
world
as
a
mediator
which
had
to
decide
which
instincts
to
act
on
and
which
not
to
freud
s
theory
of
psychosexual
development
relates
to
his
theory
of
the
id
ego
and
superego
freud
thought

with

freud
has
been
criticised
by
contemporary
psychologists
for
not
being
empirical
enough
karl
popper
criticised
freud
s
theory
for
being
unfalsifiable
as
it
could
not
say
what
would
prove
it
wrong
this
means
it
is
not
true
empiricism
freud
studied
a
small
sample
size
of
patients
a
poor
crosssection
of
society
and
did
not
do
proper
experiments
so
he
is
unscientific
however
popper
was
clear
that
he
wasn
t
saying
there
was
absolutely
nothing
of
value
in
freud
s
ideas
–
just
that
they
needed
to
be
subjected
to
proper
scientific
experiment
and
testing
piaget
was
a
contemporary
psychologist
who
developed
better
empirical
methods
of
experiment
than
freud
but
came
to
similar
conclusions
so
can
thus
be
seen
to
defend
freud
to
some
degree
from
the
accusation
of
being
unscientific
he
studied
the
development
of
children
and
argued
that
there
occurs
a
fundamental
shift
in
the
nature
of
conscience
before
the
age
of
11
children
have
what
he
called
heteronomous
morality
this
means
they
merely
associate
actions
as
bad
because
of
the
influence
of
their
authority
figures
like
parents
for
example
an
8
year
old
child
dangerously
runs
into
a
road
and
their
parent
yells
at
them
the
child
will
learn
not
to
do
that
again
but
not
because
they
have
cognitively
understood
that
running
into
the
road
will
cause
them
injury
or
death
which
would
be
a
bad
thing
but
because
they
merely
associate
the
action
of
running
into
the
road
with
the
loud
scary
noise
of
their
parents
shouting
occurring
after
11
year
old
however
piaget
argued
that
the
autonomous
morality
develops
in
children
where
they
can
begin
to
have
abstract
cognitive
moral
beliefs
about
how
one
ought
to
act
and
why
freud
s
critique
of
religion
s
approach
to
developing
the
conscience
maintaining
social
order
depends
on
people
repressing
their
antisocial
instincts
e
g
for
sex
and
violence
religion
encourages
repression
and
for
that
freud
thought
it
had
done
“
great
services
for
human
civilization
”
in
the
“
taming
of
the
asocial
instincts
”
nonetheless
freud
thought
that
the
christian
belief
system
had
long
passed
its
usefulness
because
a
secular
society
would
be
far
superior
at
enabling
selfcontrol
so
society
would
be
better
off
outgrowing
religion
freud
evaluates
religion
and
its
doctrines
not
as
claims
about
reality
but
as
strategies
for
controlling
instincts
for
example
for
freud
belief
in
and
propagation
of
the
idea
that
human
nature
is
corrupted
by
original
sin
is
really
just
a
method
of
dealing
with
our
natural
instincts
but
a
primitive
and
childish
method
that
actually
causes
as
much
immorality
and
unhappiness
as
it
prevents
viewing
humanity
as
inherently
sinful
and
only
god
as
good
who
easily
forgives
sins
does
not
provide
the
proper
motivation
for
following
religious
social
rules
causing
frequent
“
backslidings
into
sin
”
and
seeking
of
penance
after
millennia
of
religious
rule
too
many
people
are
still
unhappy
being
controlled
by
social
rules
freud
claims
this
is
because
the
religious
approach
to
conscience
is
external
imposition
by
authority
similar
to
how
children
are
treated
the
result
being
comparable
to
a
childhood
neurosis
although
rules
are
in
place
to
reduce
suffering
they
also
cause
suffering
through
repression
and
thus
inspire
unconscious
resentment
against
civilisation
freud
argues
that
the
better
approach
for
society
would
be
autonomy
people
can
rationally
understand
that
repressing
their
instincts
is
for
the
good
of
social
order
making
them
capable
of
choosing
autonomously
to
follow
social
rules
this
makes
them
more
likely
to
happily
accept
and
follow
them
furthermore
this
would
also
introduce
flexibility
into
the
rules
if
it
were
accepted
that
the
social
rules
of
human
origin
with
the
intention
of
improving
society
then
they
could
be
continually
improved
further
encouraging
adherence
to
them
ultimately
the
effectiveness
of
religious
rules
as
tools
for
social
order
depends
on
the
notion
that
a
god
has
decreed
them
which
inexorably
burdens
religious
social
order
with
the
psychology
of
external
imposition
and
the
inflexibility
of
eternal
unchanging
laws
of
god
freud
concludes
that
society
would
be
much
better
off
if
it
could
admit
that
the
purpose
of
its
social
rules
is
the
maintenance
of
social
order
rather
than
their
“
pretended
sanctity
”
aquinas
natural
law
ethics
arguably
gets
around
freud
s
critique
because
aquinas
thought
that
following
of
the
natural
law
did
involve
the
engagement
of
a
person
s
rationality
with
god
s
eternal
law
in
a
way
that
enabled
their
virtue
and
flourishing
it
s
not
simply
externally
imposed
and
there
is
a
degree
of
flexibility
in
the
application
of
the
primary
precepts
and
use
of
the
double
effect
perhaps
freud
s
critique
only
really
works
against
approaches
to
the
conscience
like
augustine
s
where
it
simply
involves
an
external
imposition
of

terms
conscience
i
definition
conscience
is
a
faculty
of
the
mind
that
motivates
us
to
act
morally
—
or
at
least
according
to
our
most
deeply
held
values
 
most
say
it
is
a
form
of
intuition
and
uses
emotion
although
others
have
argued
that
it
should
be
shaped
by
reason
 
it
is
a
private
experience
and
a
form
of
selfknowledge
from
one
s
conscience
one
can
learn
one
s
own
values
and
morals
 
this
is
the
root
of
the
word
from
the
latin
conscientia
perhaps
translatable
as
“
togetherwithknowing
”
–
to
be
together
with
one
s
knowledge
of
morality
yet
conscience
has
been
thought
by
many
to
be
informed
by
an
objective
morality
with
divine
transcendental
or
natural
sources
 
even
in
our
society
where
we
ostensibly
recognize
the
cultural
and
personal
relativity
of
morality
conscience
is
granted
a
special
status
with
laws
protecting
the
rights
of
doctors
and
others
not
to
violate
their
consciences
 
so
conscience
is
private
subjective
and
culturally
relative
but
carries
legal
and
political
weight
there
are
many
different
ideas
about
conscience
—
religious
philosophical
scientific
legal
and
popular
religious
in
most
religions
the
morality
that
informs
conscience
does
or
should
come
from
either
god
or
an
enlightened
mind
religions
differ
as
to
whether
conscience
is
thought
of
mainly
as
a
punisher
e
g
catholic
or
as
a
virtue
to
be
cultivated
e
g
protestant
buddhist
philosophical
many
philosophers
have
written
that
a
truly
moral
conscience
requires
the
exercise
of
reason
others
have
claimed
that
it
is
an
intuition
of
objective
moral
truth
premodern
philosophers
tended
to
believe
in
a
natural
and
objective
morality
informing
conscience
—
something
like
a
truly
moral
instinct
 
modern
philosophers
tend
to
recognize
the
cultural
and
individual
relativity
of
morality
and
many
present
arguments
based
on
scientific
theories
about
mind
evolution
and
society
scientific
such
as
theories
in
evolutionary
psychology
cognitive
science
and
sociology
legal
our
society
seems
to
recognize
“
freedom
of
conscience
”
–
that
we
should
be
free
to
obey
our
consciences
–
within
limits
considering
that
we
don
t
have
a
clear
or
unified
philosophy
of
conscience
this
raises
legal
political
and
social
issues
popular
our
everyday
notions
of
conscience
are
philosophically
interesting
consider
that
conscience
is
a
part
of
us
opposing
actions
that
we
ourselves
apparently
already
consider
immoral
but
are
in
danger
of
doing
anyway
 
it
seems
a
little
paradoxical
 
why
do
we
need
a
conscience
evolutionary
theory
most
likely
has
the
answer
see
“
history
”
section
thought
about
conscience
is
so
diverse
and
complex
that
a
comprehensive
treatment
is
not
possible
this
seems
another
paradox
about
conscience
we
know
it
most
intimately
in
ourselves
but
there
is
no
consensus
about
where
it
comes
from
or
how
much
it
should
be
respected
 
ii
controversies
about
conscience
freedom
of
conscience
is
part
of
the
united
nations
declaration
of
human
rights
and
the
laws
of
many
nations
 
yet
we
have
reason
to
question
the
idea
 
former
nazi
generals
have
told
interviewers
that
they
acted
with
a
clear
conscience
because
their
actions
were
sanctioned
by
their
leadership
and
society
 
this
would
be
consistent
with
ideas
about
conscience
as
a
social
instinct
but
not
necessarily
an
altruistic
one
as
darwin
thought
—
perhaps
conscience
merely
urges
us
to
conform
with
the
mores
of
our
society
or
beliefsystems
freedom
of
conscience
is
problematic
because
it
s
perfectly
possible
for
people
s
consciences
to
insist
on
actions
that
most
of
consider
harmful
to
other
human
beings
—
such
as
refusing
to
vaccinate
their
children
there
are
several
traditional
arguments
in
favor
of
freedom
of
conscience
the
argument
from
hypocrisy
or
ineffectiveness
most
people
agree
that
it
is
impossible
to
change
a
person
s
conscience
from
the
outside
therefore
not
granting
freedom
of
conscience
means
requiring
people
to
act
contrary
to
their
beliefs
which
seems
wrong
this
was
a
reason
to
consider
persecuting
heretics
ineffective
from
the
medieval
catholic
point
of
view
but
aquinas
and
others
then
justified
it
for
other
reasons
however
the
argument
from
hypocrisy
can
be
turned
around
if
you
can
t
change
a
person
s
conscience
then
they
still
have
freedom
of
conscience
even
if
you
force
them
to
behave
in
a
certain
way
the
argument
from
ignorance
this
is
based
on
the
recognition
of
relativism
and
subjectivism
if
our
consciences
don
t
give
us
objective
moral
guidance
then
you
can
t
assume
that
yours
is
right
and
another
s
wrong
therefore
you
don
t
have
a
right
to
deny
them
freedom
of
conscience
the
argument
from
legitimization
john
stuart
mill
argued
that
it
is
best
for
society
if
all
people
express
their
convictions
freely
for
that
will
make
it
possible
through
comparison
and
debate
to
better
approach
truth
however
none
of
these
arguments
completely
addresses
the
conflicts
between
freedom
of
conscience
and
public
wellbeing
 
some
might
say
that
a
doctor
who
refuses
to
perform
a
lifesaving
operation
out
of
conscience
should
be
charged
with
negligence
or
even
manslaughter
 
while
others
might
feel
that
performing
the
operation
is
murder
the
precise
limits
of
freedom
of
conscience
are
still
an
open
debate
with
profound
consequences

quotes
about
conscience
quotation

“
there
comes
a
time
when
one
must
take
a
position
that
is
neither
safe
nor
politic
nor
popular
but
he
must
take
it
because
conscience
tells
him
it
is
right
”

a
testament
of
hope
the
essential
writings
and
speeches
this
quote
seems
to
represent
the
way
most
of
us
naturally
think
of
conscience
—
assuming
that
conscience
is
always
right
as
if
it
s
a
direct
line
to
god
or
some
other
source
of
objective
moral
knowledge
 
this
also
implies
that
it
is
right
to
obey
conscience
even
if
opposes
one
s
social
and
legal
environment
 
one
the
one
hand
these
could
be
incorrect
and
dangerous
assumptions
on
the
other
we
could
never
change
injustice
in
our
society
like
dr
king
without
sometimes
trusting
conscience
over
social
norms

iv
types
of
conscience
there
are
no
types
of
conscience
recognized
by
philosophers
except
critical
conscience
which
means
the
application
of
critical
reasoning
to
ethical
decisions
 
many
religious
webpages
list
their
own
types
of
conscience
in
light
of
their
beliefs
conscience
versus
sociopathy
sociopaths
are
arguably
individuals
with
no
conscience
 
they
are
also
defined
as
incapable
of
feeling
empathy
guilt
fear
or
shame
at
hurting
others
or
violating
any
notion
of
morality
 
interestingly
psychologists
say
that
sociopaths
understand
morality
and
may
even
agree
with
the
moral
values
of
their
society
 
they
lack
only
the
brain
connection
between
those
values
and
the
emotions
that
would
prevent
them
from
hurting
others
enabling
them
to
act
without
remorse
 
most
experts
claim
that
it
is
an
incurable
condition
and
neuroscientific
research
shows
concrete
differences
between
normal
and
sociopathic
brains
 
ironically
then
sociopaths
seem
to
be
evidence
that
a
capacity
for
conscience
is
innate
in
normal
humans
 
v
history
of
conscience
before
cultural
relativity
and
subjectivism
came
into
vogue
during
the
20th
century
conscience
was
considered
a
source
of
objective
moral
knowledge
by
almost
everyone
however
in
different
senses
in
different
cultures
 
in
ancient
hinduism
buddhism
and
taoism
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
was
thought
to
be
the
natural
longterm
result
of
practicing
moral
action
and
correct
contemplation
–
in
hindu
thought
through
the
accumulation
of
good
karma
in
buddhist
and
taoist
thought
through
purification
of
the
heart
and
mind
moral
knowledge
in
these
beliefsystems
was
an
aspect
of
enlightened
mind
—
true
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
self
and
reality
ironically
though
each
belief
system
had
different
ideas
about
the
content
of
this
truth
and
morality
 
in
hinduism
it
was
primarily
about
selfsacrifice
in
buddhism
compassion
and
in
taoism
harmony
with
society
and
nature
judaism
christianity
and
islam
represented
a
very
different
conception
arguably
 
all
three
religions
are
supposed
to
accept
the
story
of
genesis
which
says
that
man
s
acquisition
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
was
a
fall
from
grace
original
sin
 
therefore
according
to
some
interpretations
following
one
s
own
intuitions
is
more
likely
a
source
of
sin
than
morality
 
instead
obedience
to
god
s
law
is
thought
the
only
true
morality
 
this
would
mean
that
true
conscience
is
knowledge
of
god
s
law
whether
that
comes
directly
from
god
or
through
obedience
to
scripture
or
clergy
all
these
possibilities
—
direct
revelation
scripture
and
obedience
to
authorities
–
have
been
claimed
as
the
source
of
moral
knowledge
in
these
religions
 
however
in
practice
these
religions
also
teach
purification
of
the
mind
to
attain
true
conscience
where
eastern
religions
teach
that
a
pure
mind
allows
the
truth
to
emerge
from
within
one
s
own
consciousness
most
versions
of
the
abrahamic
religions
see
a
pure
mind
as
a
prerequisite
for
receiving
god
s
truth
greek
and
roman
thought
emphasized
reason
and
knowledge
in
making
moral
decisions
a
tradition
beginning
with
aristotle
s
ideas
about
the
development
of
virtuous
character
and
wisdom
through
reason
and
practice
 
this
is
also
true
of
judaism
known
for
its
talmud
a
body
of
writing
devoted
to
interpreting
scripture
and
applying
it
to
ethical
issues
through
rational
analysis
and
debate
despite
the
emphasis
on
blind
obedience
in
christianity
medieval
christian
philosophers
developed
a
theory
of
conscience
with
a
strong
role
for
both
intuition
and
reasoning
 
st
bonaventure
and
st
aquinas
wrote
of
synderesis
–
a
divine
spark
of
moral
knowledge
–
which
could
only
come
to
a
mind
which
had
been
cultivated
by
reason
and
contemplation
to
overcome
the
distortions
and
corruption
of
social
conditioning
in
the
17th
century
spinoza
similarly
wrote
that
it
was
necessary
to
practice
and
develop
reason
to
transcend
socially
conditioned
emotions
and
perceptions
 
however
instead
of
positing
a
diving
spark
as
the
source
of
moral
truth
spinoza
said
that
if
you
view
problems
from
the
perspective
of
eternity
with
a
peaceful
mind
you
will
perceive
moral
truth
 
 
kant
also
regarded
critical
reasoning
as
an
important
element
of
conscience
believing
that
moral
truth
could
be
evaluated
objectively
in
light
of
his
categorical
imperative
 
other
18th
century
philosophers
believed
that
conscience
was
purely
intuitive
excluding
reason
but
like
kant
many
of
them
also
believed
in
the
objectivity
of
the
moral
truth
informing
conscience
from
the
18th
century
on
increasing
numbers
of
philosophers
spoke
for
pragmatic
and
relativistic
ideas
about
conscience
 
john
locke
wrote
about
how
a
moral
conscience
might
oppose
the
laws
of
the
state
and
thomas
hobbes
insisted
that
opinions
based
on
conscience
could
easily
be
wrong
or
in
contradiction
to
other
people
s
consciences
 
so
these
and
other
philosophers
also
advocated
for
a
critical
conscience
–
and
some
skepticism
about
the
dictates
of
conscience
in
general
in
the
19th
century
darwin
hypothesized
that
conscience
evolved
to
resolve
conflicts
between
instincts
such
as
between
instincts
for
selfpreservation
and
instincts
to
protect
and
cooperate
with
other
human
beings
in
the
20th
century
freud
analyzed
conscience
as
an
effect
of
the
superego
as
we
grow
up
natural
instincts
such
as
aggression
and
sexual
desire
must
be
frequently
frustrated
and
even
punished
by
parents
and
peers
in
order
for
us
to
develop
into
welladjusted
members
of
society
 
this
process
creates
the
superego
where
we
internalize
the
beliefs
implicit
or
explicit
about
right
and
wrong
in
our
culture
and
the
superego
causes
us
to
feel
guilt
or
anxiety
when
we
violate
them
where
darwin
said
that
conscience
evolved
to
resolve
inner
conflicts
other
more
recent
evolutionary
psychologists
suggest
that
it
evolved
to
motivate
altruistic
behavior
which
is
now
thought
to
be
evolutionarily
adaptive
for
social
creatures
few
today
would
claim
that
conscience
is
a
source
of
objective
morality
divine
transcendental
or
otherwise
since
it
is
obvious
that
two
people
s
consciences
or
religions
can
dictate
opposing
moralities
—
such
as
prochoice
and
prolife
 
 
therefore
philosophers
today
are
more
concerned
with
exploring
the
consequences
of
this
relativity
of
conscience
especially
since
people
still
seem
to
think
of
conscience
as
objectively
true
sacred
and
inviolable
which
leads
naturally
to
our
controversy
–
“
freedom
of
conscience
”

in

clip
from
the
old

pinocchio
film
jiminy
cricket
gives
the
boy
who
would
be
human
a
lecture
and
song
about
conscience
with
the
message
“
always
let
your
conscience
be
your
guide
”
 
although
that
message
implies
relying
on
intuitive
conscience
it
s
interesting
that
the
cricket
first
tries
to
explain
something
like
critical
conscience
to
pinocchio
before
giving
up
in
confusion
and
falling
back
on
a
traditional
christian
notion
of
conscience

resistance

this

nicely
dramatizes
one
of
the
most
popular
conceptions
of
conscience
in
our
society
—
the
devil
and
angel

this
colorful
and
compelling
image
seems
to
imply
that
true
morality
consists
of
righteousness
while
following
the
one
that
“
rocks
”
is
the
evil
one
 
however
instead
of
emphasizing
good
vs
evil
they
both
just
confuse
the

and

introduction
each
of
us
has
at
one
time
or
another
talked
about
our
conscience
we
might
have
been
“
pricked
by
our
conscience
”
or
our
conscience
might
have
“
butted
in
”
when
it
was
not
wanted
we
might
be
going
on
quite
happily
telling
a
lie
to
a
friend
or
might
have
accidentally
walked
out
of
a
shop
without
paying
for
something
and
it
is
our
conscience
that
makes
us
confess
or
stops
us
in
our
tracks
spins
us
on
our
heels
and
takes
us
back
into
the
shop
people
from
different
walks
of
life
talk
of
the
“
conscience
”
from
the
religious
believer
the
politician
the
celebrity
to
every
day
folk
we
might
hear
someone
berate
their
conscience
for
nagging
them
to
do
something
they
do
not
want
to
people
might
be
labelled
“
conscientious
objectors
”
because
they
feel
their
conscience
is
telling
them
to
object
to
certain
political
actions
e
g
war
a
protester
might
lament
the
erosion
of
their
“
freedom
of
conscience
”
and
we
can
find
concepts
very
similar
to
“
conscience
”
in
many
nonchristian
religious
traditions
both
eastern
and
western
throughout
history
and
from
around
the
globe
1
however
the
nature
of
conscience
is
obscure
and
consequently
the
philosophical
discussion
of
conscience
is
complex
and
has
a
long
history
it
draws
on
issues
in
philosophical
psychology
philosophy
of
religion
epistemology
philosophy
of
mind
applied
ethics
normative
ethics
and
metaethics
in
this
chapter
we
ll
give
a
general
overview
of
two
theories
of
conscience
one
draws
on
aquinas
s
account
the
other
sigmund
freud
s
1856
–
1939
although
freud
is
not
typically
seen
as
a
philosopher
he
s
a
psychologist
his
account
will
provide
us
with
some
insights
which
allows
us
to
think
philosophically
about
this
thing
we
call
“
the
conscience
”
2
the
history
of
conscience
in
the
twentyfirst
century
conscience
is
not
thought
of
as
solely
a
religious
idea
however
talk
of
“
conscience
”
was
popularised
at
least
in
“
the
west
”
due
to
its
adoption
by
both
protestant
and
catholic
traditions
in
this
section
we
ll
look
how
“
conscience
”
is
and
has
been
used
in
order
to
draw
out
some
general
features
“
conscience
”
played
a
role
in
one
of
the
most
famous
speeches
in
the
protestant
reformation
martin
luther
1483
–
1546
being
charged
with
heresy
and
being
forced
to
recant
by
charles
v
stands
his
grounds
and
says
“
here
i
stand
i
can
do
no
other
”
and
“
i
cannot
nor
will
i
retract
anything
since
it
is
never
safe
nor
virtuous
to
go
against
conscience
”
luther
believed
that
his
godgiven
conscience
was
not
allowing
him
to
recant
not
even
under
the
considerable
pressure
by
the
powerful
people
before
him
or
consider
a
more
recent
example
in
the
midst
of
political
turmoil
of
the
civil
rights
movement
martin
luther
king
jr
who
was
under
threat
and
constant
pressure
to
change
his
views
said
but
conscience
asks
the
question
is
it
right
and
there
comes
a
time
when
we
must
take
a
position
that
is
neither
safe
nor
politic
nor
popular
but
one
must
take
it
because
it
is
right
2
conscience
is
then
powerful
it
seems
that
it
can
move
a
person
to
put
themselves
in
mortal
danger
to
“
stand
up
and
be
counted
”
to
act
contrary
to
selfinterest
but
it
is
not
just
saints
and
heroes
that
talk
of
conscience
conscience
has
been
cited
by
the
most
repugnant
and
morally
abhorrent
people
who
have
ever
lived
racists
murderers
tyrants
dictators
for
example
as
bettina
stangneth
s
states
in
eichmann
before
jerusalem
the
unexamined
life
of
a
mass
murderer3
a
discussion
of
the
inner
life
of
one
of
the
nazi
s
most
notorious
officers
“
conscience
was
simply
the
morality
of
the
fatherland
that
dwells
within
a
person
which
eichmann
also
termed
the
voice
of
the
blood
”
conscience
can
be
male
or
female
or
both
or
neither
it
can
be
one
voice
or
many
it
can
echo
religious
ideas
social
ideas
racist
ideas
lofty
ideas
or
ideas
found
in
the
filth
of
human
corruption
conscience
can
develop
at
any
particular
age
and
dissipates
at
any
age
it
does
not
“
speak
”
and
it
does
“
speak
”
and
does
not
have
a
language
of
choice
all
of
these
observations
then
leave
a
number
of
observations
and
questions
there
seem
to
be
at
least
three
related
functions
that
we
think
the
conscience
plays
first
it
tells
us
what
we
ought
to
do
as
a
guide
for
our
lives
second
it
is
a
source
of
moral
knowledge
that
is
we
might
say
“
i
know
that
stealing
a
pen
is
wrong
because
my
conscience
told
me
”
third
it
might
be
thought
of
as
a
motivation
that
is
it
might
be
the
thing
that
actually
gets
us
up
out
of
our
seat
to
act
in
certain
ways
even
when
things
are
difficult
or
even
life
threatening
just
to
clarify
we
can
see
the
difference
in
the
first
two
of
these
functions
if
we
think
of
a
tyrant
who
says
for
example
“
my
conscience
tells
me
i
have
to
kill
all
mentally
ill
people
to
help
the
country
”
clearly
this
is
a
case
where
her
conscience
is
telling
her
how
she
ought
to
behave
but
given
that
we
think
that
killing
the
mentally
ill
is
morally
wrong
we
do
not
want
to
say
that
in
this
case
her
conscience
gives
her
knowledge
of
what
is
right
and
wrong
so
it
might
be
true
that
the
conscience
gives
us
guidance
but
not
knowledge
equally
the
opposite
seems
true
that
we
might
know
what
is
right
and
wrong
yet
fail
to
be
guided
to
do
it
this
predicament
is
what
shakespeare
captured
in
this
famous
quotation
“
conscience
doth
make
cowards
of
us
all
”

consider
another
point
conscience
is
subjective
in
that
it
is
about
one
reflecting
inwards
on
oneself
on
how
one
might
“
feel
”
about
certain
things
it
is
not
about
looking
out
into
the
world
at
a
set
of
rules
or
laws
we
experience
the
conscience
differently
than
we
would
if
a
friend
priest
politician
or
imam
was
telling
us
what
to
do
of
course
although
conscience
is
“
inward
looking
”
that
is
not
the
same
as
saying
that
we
just
make
up
what
the
conscience
allegedly
tells
us
for
instance
we
might
think
that
what
is
right
and
wrong
is
dependent
on
god
but
also
think
that
we
come
to
know
what
is
right
and
wrong
through
our
conscience
finally
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
term
“
conscience
”
was
only
formalized
in
its
modern
moral
meaning
in
the
mid
eighteenth
century
e
g
neither
plato
nor
aristotle
talk
of
conscience
however
note
that
just
because
a
term
is
modern
or
just
because
there
is
disagreement
with
how
a
term
is
used
that
does
not
mean
that
the
ideas
themselves
are
new
consider
the
point
that
the
terms
“
molecules
”
and
“
atoms
”
were
recent
inventions
and
that
in
their
development
they
might
be
used
to
talk
about
different
things
and
they
engendered
disagreement
within
the
scientific
community
this
in
itself
does
not
lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
there
are
no
molecules
and
no
atoms
so
the
lack
of
term
“
conscience
”
and
disagreement
about
what
“
conscience
”
means
does
not
mean
that
conscience
is
merely
an
“
invention
”
with
all
these
points
in
mind
let
s
consider
one
of
the
key
thinkers
in
relation
to
conscience
aquinas
3
aquinas
on
conscience
if
you
recall
from
aquinas
developed
a
natural
law
theology
the
basic
idea
is
that
through
reason
what
he
calls
ratio
we
can
come
to
recognize
certain
precepts
that
we
ought
to
live
by
aquinas
thinks
that
this
reliance
on
thinking
and
reflection
is
revealed
in
the
bible
they
show
that
the
requirements
of
the
law
are
written
on
their
hearts
their
consciences
also
bearing
witness
and
their
thoughts
sometimes
accusing
them
and
at
other
times
even
defending
them
4
notice
then
that
for
paul
—
and
aquinas
—
the
“
conscience
”
bears
witness
sometimes
accusing
the
person
sometimes
defending
them
for
aquinas
conscience
is
morally
neutral
it
simply
“
bears
witness
”
it
is
a
“
signpost
”
and
after
all
signposts
do
not
opinions
on
things
see
aquinas
summa
part

question

article
13
to
be
clear
then
aquinas
did
not
take
conscience
to
be
a
source
of
moral
knowledge
but
as
a
guide
this
means
that
aquinas
unlike
luther
and
postreformation
thinkers
took
conscience
to
be
fallible
for
aquinas
we
may
be
wrong
in
following
our
conscience
as
it
can
move
us
in
the
wrong
directionmislead
us
for
aquinas
the
conscience
is
the
act
of
applying
the
universal
principles
the
eternaldivine
law
to
actual
real
life
situations
aquinas
explicitly
defines
“
conscience
”
as
the
“
application
of
knowledge
to
activity
”
summa
theologica
i
–
ii
i
so
if
conscience
for
aquinas
is
about
the
application
of
knowledge
to
activity
this
raises
the
question
how
we
get
this
knowledge
this
is
where
another
key
technical
term
is
introduced
the
synderesis
synderesis
is
not
the
same
as
conscience
but
is
the
innate
ability
of
the
mind
—
what
he
calls
a
habit
of
the
mind
—
to
apprehend
the
eternaldivine
laws
the
role
of
conscience
is
to
apply
the
primary
precepts
discovered
as
the
content
of
synderesis
to
get
a
better
understanding
of
synderesis
consider
someone
trying
to
work
out
the
quickest
way
to
get
between
two
points
through
rational
reflection
they
will
see
that
it
is
the
straight
line
this
“
coming
to
recognize
through
reflection
”
is
what
aquinas
has
in
mind
when
he
talks
about
synderesis
for
aquinas
unlike
conscience
synderesis
is
never
mistaken
humans
do
wrong
thinks
aquinas
when
conscience
and
not
synderesis
makes
a
mistake
this
means
that
a
failure
of
conscience
needs
to
be
clearly
thought
through
on
aquinas
s
account
for
aquinas
conscience
errs
because
of
ignorance
about
how
to
apply
the
eternaldivine
laws
of
which
there
are
two
types
ignorance
that
can
be
overcome
by
using
one
s
reason
vincible
ignorance
and
ignorance
that
cannot
be
overcome
by
using
one
s
reason
invincible
ignorance
invincible
ignorance
is
doing
something
wrong
when
one
could
not
have
known
better
vincible
ignorance
is
doing
wrong
when
one
ought
to
have
known
better
but
how
might
this
relate
to
conscience
imagine
two
people
going
into
a
gun
shop
the
first
person
has
no
criminal
record
has
never
been
in
trouble
with
the
police
nor
at
school
and
they
have
no
record
of
mental
illness
he
is
for
all
intents
and
purposes
a
model
citizen
this
person
buys
a
gun
and
goes
on
a
killing
rampage
the
owner
of
the
shop
by
following
her
conscience
has
not
done
something
morally
wrong
because
her
ignorance
is
invincible
there
was
no
indication
that
this
would
have
been
a
likely
outcome
this
contrasts
to
the
person
who
is
sold
a
gun
even
though
he
has
a
violent
criminal
record
which
would
have
shown
up
on
a
basic
background
check
in
this
case
the
owner
of
the
gun
shop
following
her
conscience
has
done
something
morally
wrong
because
in
this
case
her
ignorance
is
vincible
to
conclude
aquinas
thinks
all
of
us
can
know
infallibly
what
is
right
and
wrong
through
synderesis
however
even
though
we
are
infallible
about
this
we
can
and
do
make
mistakes
in
applying
this
knowledge
it
is
our
conscience
conscientia
which
tells
us
how
to
apply
this
knowledge
and
moves
us
to
act
it
can
go
wrong
through
ignorance
ignorance
which
could
have
been
avoided
vincible
means
our
action
is
morally
wrong
mistakes
deriving
from
ignorance
we
could
not
have
avoided
invincible
means
our
action
is
not
morally
wrong
in
the
next
section
we
will
consider
what
freud
has
to
say
about
conscience
and
explain
how
he
reconceptualises
it
as
a
psychological
and
not
theological
concept
and
in
doing
so
argues
we
should
not
accept
it
as
an
inherently
good
notion
4
freud
and
the
conscience
freud
is
best
known
as
a
psychologist
and
the
architect
of
psychoanalysis
he
is
controversial
and
most
philosophers
and
psychologists
reject
the
ideas
he
presents
however
his
ideas
have
been
incredibly
influential
and
indeed
his
name
has
entered
our
everyday
talk
in
the
form
of
a
“
freudian
slip
”
among
freud
s
many
ideas
his
conceptualization
of
the
structure
of
the
mind
is
key
to
his
views
on
conscience
he
thinks
the
mind
can
be
thought
of
as
containing
three
parts
the
id
the
ego
and
the
superego
freud
s
account
of
conscience
is
understood
as
the
relation
between
these
for
freud
the
id
is
the
collection
of
our
primal
drives
e
g
the
basic
desires
for
food
sex
drink
and
is
the
oldest
part
of
the
mind
the
id
cannot
be
properly
formalized
or
understood
and
freud
likens
it
to
chaos
it
is
instinctive
emotional
and
illogical
we
cannot
list
all
the
drives
that
make
up
the
id
as
they
are
inaccessible
to
us
freud
has
a
nice
way
of
describing
the
id
he
calls
it
“
a
cauldron
full
of
seething
excitations
”
se
xxii
73
although
we
can
say
very
little
about
the
content
of
the
id
freud
did
think
that
there
was
a
general
principle
to
help
us
understand
the
drives
in
the
id
what
he
calls
the
“
pleasure
principle
”
this
is
the
claim
that
what
identifies
and
unifies
the
drives
of
the
id
is
the
avoidance
of
pain
and
pursuit
of
pleasure
now
as
a
very
young
child
it
may
be
ok
to
be
driven
by
the
pleasure
principle
they
crawl
singlemindedly
after
the
chocolate
buttons
to
put
in
their
mouth
they
crave
their
mother
s
milk
irrespective
of
anything
else
however
as
we
develop
we
soon
realize
that
we
cannot
simply
act
on
the
primal
instincts
of
the
id
as
we
have
to
navigate
ourselves
in
the
social
spaces
we
inhabit
we
have
to
understand
boundaries
sanctions
and
consequences
to
successfully
operate
in
the
world
we
need
to
consciously
reflect
and
reason
and
ultimately
we
have
to
delay
instinctive
behaviour
and
“
weighup
”
the
situation
put
bluntly
someone
whose
id
is
unchecked
would
cease
to
be
acceptable
in
society
and
find
themselves
physically
socially
and
emotionally
isolated
it
is
what
freud
calls
the
“
ego
”
which
plays
this
policing
role
but
if
we
only
have
the
id
and
the
ego
then
it
is
unclear
why
we
would
not
simply
follow
the
pleasure
principle
that
is
although
the
ego
rationally
reflects
it
needs
something
to
weighup
against
the
id
we
need
some
authority
that
monitors
what
the
ego
is
doing
this
authority
is
what
freud
calls
the
superego
early
in
our
life
our
parents
as
well
as
society
religious
leaders
etc
tell
us
what
we
can
and
cannot
do
and
chastise
us
for
breaking
rules
and
as
we
grow
older
we
internalize
these
things
and
“
hear
them
”
as
a
voice
of
authority
imagine
that
your
mum
has
always
told
you
not
to
sit
with
your
elbows
on
the
table
then
you
internalize
this
rule
so
when
you
are
much
older
and
not
living
with
your
mum
any
longer
the
voice
of
your
“
superego
”
speaks
with
authority
—
“
take
your
elbows
off
the
table
”
these
are
the
very
basics
of
freud
structure
of
the
mind
our
ego
balances
the
primal
drives
of
the
id
with
the
voice
of
authority
from
the
superego
where
does
the
conscience
come
in
for
freud
the
conscience
is
the
form
that
the
superego
takes
in
addressing
the
ego
when
the
internalized
authority
derived
from
parental
socialreligious
rules
and
regulations
controls
the
ego
is
it
is
understood
as
“
the
conscience
”
in
our
last
example
it
is
our
“
conscience
”
that
tells
us
to
remove
our
elbows
from
the
table
notice
then
that
our
conscience
often
requires
certain
things
from
us
which
we
fail
to
achieve
and
this
gives
rise
to
guilt
for
freud
the
conscience
can
be
thought
of
as
synonymous
with
the
“
guilty
conscience
”
our
ego
is
punished
through
guilt
by
the
form
of
the
superego
we
call
conscience
furthermore
freud
says
that
when
the
superego
fails
to
deal
properly
with
the
id
—
when
the
pleasure
principle
is
repressed
—
this
forms
what
he
calls
neurosis
you
can
also
hopefully
see
the
differences
between
aquinas
and
freud
first
the
obvious
point
is
that
for
freud
the
conscience
is
not
the
voice
of
god
second
unlike
aquinas
freud
thinks
that
the
conscience
could
be
bad
destructive
and
unhelpful
the
conscience
is
the
way
the
ego
experiences
the
authority
of
the
superego
but
the
superego
is
arrived
at
through
the
experiences
we
have
and
of
course
we
might
have
had
really
bad
experiences
growing
up
where
parents
are
stifling
overly
authoritarian
distant
cold
hard
violent
abusive
etc
in
these
sorts
of
cases
the
conscience
would
be
stifling
overly
authoritarian
distant
etc
this
means
that
although
freud
does
not
think
we
can
or
should
get
rid
of
the
conscience
he
does
think
we
should
treat
it
with
a
healthy
dose
of
scepticism
and
hence
not
be
kowtowed
by
the
“
guilt
”
that
is
our
ego
s
punishment
for
falling
short
of
the
superego
conscience
is
the
product
of
our
often
nonideal
upbringing
rather
than
a
divinelyinspired
force
for
good
5
freud
s
psychosexual
development
theory
psychosexual
development
theory
is
a
theory
of
sexual
development
from
birth
to
death
freud
was
the
first
thinker
to
look
at
the
entire
lifespan
in
terms
of
development
freud
thought
that
as
we
develop
we
move
through
different
stages
at
each
stage
our
libido
sex
drive
is
focused
towards
different
things
if
we
fail
to
move
through
a
stage
completely
or
return
to
a
stage
then
problems
arise
and
we
might
become
fixated
with
the
area
associated
with
that
stage
this
can
be
a
serious
problem
for
our
relationships
and
could
be
an
underlying
cause
of
mental
illness
the
first
stage
is
the
oral
stage
from
birth
to
about
one
and
a
half
this
stage
is
where
babies
get
pleasure
through
putting
things
in
their
mouth
pleasure
in
biting
chewing
and
sucking
for
example
babies
soon
after
they
are
born
are
breastfeeding
and
as
the
baby
develops
they
navigate
and
explore
the
world
through
putting
things
in
their
mouth
notice
that
during
this
phase
babies
are
very
dependent
on
others
according
to
freud
at
this
stage
not
only
do
we
get
information
about
the
world
but
we
also
fulfil
the
id
babies
who
can
bite
chew
and
such
as
much
as
they
want
are
being
guided
by
the
id
freud
explains
behaviours
like
smoking
chewing
gum
overeating
with
failure
to
move
properly
through
this
stage
which
prevented
the
successful
development
of
the
id
the
next
stage
from
about
one
and
a
half
to
three
years
is
the
anal
stage
here
pleasure
is
gained
through
controlling
going
to
the
toilet
this
stage
is
about
gaining
control
of
one
s
body
and
it
starts
with
controlling
the
bladder
and
bowels
being
potty
trained
it
is
around
this
time
that
the
ego
develops
this
control
of
their
bodies
is
a
source
of
pride
and
pleasure
for
children
agents
who
fail
to
properly
move
through
this
stage
are
what
are
sometimes
called
“
anally
retentive
”
that
is
someone
who
is
overly
controlling
or
out
of
control
and
messy
because
—
according
to
freud
—
they
do
not
want
to
let
go
of
their
waste
or
do
not
care
where
or
when
they
let
go
of
their
waste
the
next
phase
of
development
from
about
three
to
six
years
is
the
phallic
stage
in
which
a
child
discovers
one
s
genitals
and
importantly
that
they
are
different
in
men
and
women
this
stage
is
where
freud
thinks
we
develop
the
oedipus
and
the
electra
complex
a
problematic
phallic
stage
will
cause
problems
with
intimacy
in
later
life
the
next
stage
the
latency
stage
is
from
six
years
to
the
onset
of
puberty
this
stage
is
not
about
pleasure
in
the
body
as
the
libido
is
“
latent
”
or
hidden
—
this
is
the
stage
where
sexual
desire
is
repressed
and
no
new
sexual
desires
emerge
at
this
stage
girls
play
with
girls
in
order
to
learn
the
role
of
a
girl
and
boys
play
with
boys
in
order
to
learn
about
the
role
of
boys
the
child
learns
how
to
navigate
the
social
world
a
difficult
latency
stage
leads
to
relational
problems
and
understanding
one
s
gender
the
libido
then
reappears
in
the
final
stage
which
lasts
to
our
death
and
which
freud
calls
the
mature
genital
stage
this
is
where
the
individual
not
only
recognises
the
difference
between
men
and
women
but
also
shows
a
desire
to
engage
in
a
sexual
relationship
and
more
generally
a
pursuit
of
pleasure
and
happiness
people
become
sexually
active
fall
in
love
and
get
married
this
is
the
stage
where
we
acquire
a
fully
developed
conscience
summary
the
notion
of
“
conscience
”
has
appeared
for
thousands
of
years
in
different
cultures
even
though
it
has
not
always
been
called
“
conscience
”
modern
christian
orthodoxy
popularised
it
and
characterised
it
in
relation
to
god
s
voice
and
guidance
aquinas
thought
that
conscience
is
the
way
we
understand
how
to
apply
what
we
know
in
aquinas
s
view
our
conscience
is
fallible
and
might
guide
us
wrongly
when
our
conscience
“
gets
it
wrong
”
we
can
be
either
culpable
—
through
vincible
ignorance
—
or
not
culpable
—
through
invincible
ignorance
freud
is
less
convinced
that
conscience
is
a
force
for
good
and
he
is
certain
that
it
has
not
got
anything
to
do
with
god
for
freud
conscience
can
be
either
a
good
or
bad
we
can
think
of
our
mind
as
having
three
parts
the
id
ego
and
superego
the
conscience
for
freud
is
the
form
the
superego
takes
when
it
is
trying
to
keep
the
ego
in
line
it
is
internalized
as
the
voice
of
authority
the
superego
is
about
following
rules
but
those
rules
do
not
come
from
“
on
high
”
they
derive
from
the
upbringing
we
have
had
so
if
we
have
had
a
repressive
upbringing
then
the
superego
—
the
voice
of
conscience
—
will
be
repressive
how
we
develop
these
three
features
of
the
mind
is
through
what
freud
calls
psychosexual
development
if
we
do
not
develop
correctly
then
we
become
fixated
and
repressive
form
a
neurosis
and
ultimately
become
mentally
ill
freud
thought
that
this
could
be
avoided
by
working
through
the
psychosexual
stages
in
the
normal
way
and
can
be
treated
through
psychosexual
counselling
common
student
mistakes
writing
conscious
when
meaning
conscience
confuse
synderesis
and
conscience
confusing
conscience
as
guidance
with
conscience
as
the
source
of
knowledge
believe
freud
thinks
the
conscience
is
always
bad
thinking
that
for
aquinas
conscience
is
way
of
knowing
what
is
right
and
wrong
thinking
that
because
the
term
conscience
is
new
conscience
itself
is
a
modern
invention
issues
to
consider
1
do
you
think
you
have
a
conscience
what
does
it
tell
you
2
what
is
the
difference
between
synderesis
and
conscience
3
do
you
think
that
everyone
ultimately
knows
—
if
they
reason
correctly
—
what
is
right
and
wrong
4
what
is
the
difference
between
vincible
and
invincible
is
not
most
of
the
supposedly
invincible
knowledge
really
vincible
we
just
need
to
try
harder
5
what
are
the
possible
different
roles
for
the
conscience
6
could
the
conscience
be
a
morally
bad
thing
7
why
does
freud
think
we
need
to
be
cautious
about
listening
to
our
conscience
8
how
does
freud
s
account
of
conscience
relate
to
his
psychosexual
development
theory
9
what
do
you
think
about
freud

psychosexual
development
theory
10
draw
up

of
the
key
stages
and

could

conscience
a
personal
sense
of
the
moral
content
of
one
s
own
conduct
intentions
or
character
with
regard
to
a
feeling
of
obligation
to
do
right
or
be
good
conscience
usually
informed
by
acculturation
and
instruction
is
thus
generally
understood
to
give
intuitively
authoritative
judgments
regarding
the
moral
quality
of
single
actions
historically
almost
every
culture
has
recognized
the
existence
of
such
a
faculty
ancient
egyptians
for
example
were
urged
not
to
transgress
against
the
dictates
of
the
heart
for
one
“
must
stand
in
fear
of
departing
from
its
guidance
”
in
some
belief
systems
conscience
is
regarded
as
the
voice
of
god
and
therefore
a
completely
reliable
guide
of
conduct
among
the
hindus
it
is
considered
“
the
invisible
god
who
dwells
within
us
”
among
western
religious
groups
the
society
of
friends
or
quakers
places
particular
emphasis
on
the
role
of
conscience
in
apprehending
and
responding
through
conduct
to
the
“
inner
light
”
of
god
outside
the
context
of
religion
philosophers
social
scientists
and
psychologists
have
sought
to
understand
conscience
in
both
its
individual
and
universal
aspects
the
view
that
holds
conscience
to
be
an
innate
intuitive
faculty
determining
the
perception
of
right
and
wrong
is
called
intuitionism
the
view
that
holds
conscience
to
be
a
cumulative
and
subjective
inference
from
past
experience
giving
direction
to
future
conduct
is
called
empiricism
the
behavioral
scientist
on
the
other
hand
may
view
the
conscience
as
a
set
of
learned
responses
to
particular
social
stimuli
another
explanation
of
conscience
was
put
forth
in
the
20th
century
by
sigmund
freud
in
his
postulation
of
the
superego
according
to
freud
the
superego
is
a
major
element
of
personality
that
is
formed
by
the
child
s
incorporation
of
moral
values
through
parental
approval
or
punishment
the
resulting
internalized
set
of
prohibitions
condemnations
and
inhibitions
is
that
part
of
the
superego
known
as
conscience

of
hammurabi

i
advised
my

her
when
someone
has
a
guilty
conscience
it
means
that
“

guilty
about
something
they
did
that
they
perceive
as
wrong
”
my
guilty
conscience
kept
me
up
all
night
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
spectrum
when
someone
has
a
clear
conscience
they
feel
that
they
did
the
right

therefore
feel
no
guilt
my

our
conscience
can
be
described
as
our
knowledge
of
ourselves
our
awareness
of
the
moral
principles
we
are
committed
to
and
our
motivation
to
act
one
of
the
most
fundamental
teachings
in
the
catholic
tradition
is
the
primacy
of
conscience
this
doctrine
states
that
catholics
must
use
their
reason
to
discern
ethically
complex
situations
and
that
our
individual
consciences
should
be
the
final
arbiter
in
all
moral
decisionmaking
the
catechism
of
the
catholic
church
states
that
we
have
the
right
to
act
in
conscience
and
in
freedom
to
make
moral
decisions
and
that
no
one
should
be
forced
to
act
contrary
to
their
consciences
as
catholics
we
believe
that
we
must
use
all
of
the
resources
available
to
us
to
form
our
consciences
so
that
we
can
make
the
best
possible
decisions
for
ourselves
particularly
in
morally
complex
circumstances
we
believe
this
is
particularly
essential
when
making
choices
regarding
sexual
and
reproductive
health
catholics
for
choice
fights
for
the
rights
of
all
individuals
to
make
decisions
regarding
sexual
and
reproductive
health
based
on
their
own
consciences
but
we
are
conscious
of
the
fact
that
poverty
racism
and
other
forms
of
powerlessness
often
limit
the
possibility
of
using
one
s
conscience
for
this
reason
we
also
strive
to
dismantle
the
structures
of
injustice
that
force
people
into
situations
in
which
they

about
conscience
we
ve
compiled
these
talking
points
to
help
inform
catholic
conversations
about
conscience
what
is
a
conscience
our
conscience
is
our
capacity
to
judge
right
from
wrong
and
good
from
evil
it
is
an
internal
moral
compass
that
seeks
truth
and
wisdom
to
guide
own
behavior
and
decisions
one
s
conscience
draws
upon
moral
codes
that
come
from
religion
and
society
as
well
as
one
s
internal
belief
systems
and

what
factors

many
factors
form
one
s
conscience
they
include
the
wisdom
of
one
s
religious

of
course
but
a
wellformed
conscience
also
incorporates
knowledge
from
other

as
science
medicine
ethical
frameworks
and
our
own
experience
are
there
limits
on
the
ways
in
which
we
can

our

sinful

everyone
has
a
purpose
few
have
a
conscience
purpose
is
the
raison
d
être
of
a
company
the
permanent
basis
of
its
strategy
every
company
has
a
purpose
explicit
or
not
however
few
–
although
this
is
changing
–
have
a
conscience
to
be
clear
the
mafia
has
a
purpose
but
consciousness
is
just
another
story
let
s
start
with
this
litmus
test
“
who
said
this
statement
”
to
start
off
relaxed
i
d
like
to
invite
you
to
play
and
take
part
in
this
riddle
with
three
possible
answers
although
only
one
of
them
is
the
right
one
the
question
is
who
has
explicitly
told
this
institutional
purpose
the
purpose
under
scrutiny
is
“
caring
for
those
around
us
always
ensuring
their
wellbeing
and
that
of
their
families
for
a
lifetime
protecting
our
environment
taking
care
of
raw
materials
giving
security
to
producers
recycling
our
waste
”
the
potential
answers
are
1
paulus
“
paul
”
gerardus
josephus
maria
polman
former
ceo
of
unilever
2
pope
francis
266th

“
tony
”
john
soprano
sr
capo
di
tutti
capi
–
from
the
sopranos
crime
drama
tv
series
credit
cowomen
before
giving
the
right
answer
we
must
admit
that
all
three
could
have
said
that
quote
one
talking
about
the
unilever
raison
d
être
pope
francis
in
his
second
encyclical
laudato
si
and
we
are
left
with
tony
soprano
whom
you
probably
know
i
guess
and
the
correct
choice
is
the
number
“
3
”
words
more
or
words
least
this
was
the
way
tony
soprano
described
to
his
psychologist
the
business
he
was
in
and
leading
by
this
what
i
mean
is
that
everyone
has
a
purpose
even
the
mafia
yet
few
have
a
conscience
and
even
fewer
are
specific
in
the
way
they
define
it
consciousness
needs
sincerity
rather
than
authenticity
for
a
company
being
true
to
itself
means
being
concerned
admitting
vulnerability
and
making
bold
choices
for
example
stopping
collaborating
with
other
firms
that
do
not
meet
a
company
s
standards
of
conduct
assuming
responsibility
for
mistakes
that
affect
society
abandoning
businesses
that
are
no
longer
legitimate
in
other
words
being
consistent
between
what
the
company
thinks
does
and
says
behaving
truthfully
and
being
unapologetically
driven
by
values
are
two
of
the
essential
characteristics
that
today
s
society
is
demanding
from
each
institution
see
alsoa
better
future
finale
–
advertisers
total
commitment
to
people
and
communities
the
key
difference
between
being
authentic
and
sincere
is
that
a
business
can
be
authentic
and
behave
without
a
sense
of
morality
or
ethics
while
it
is
impossible
to
think
of
a
sincere
company
behaving
in
that
way
on
the
one
hand
we
all
have
examples
of
rude
unresponsive
and
abusive
companies
that
are
authentic
but
are
seldom
true
to
themselves
and
conscious
of
others
on
the
other
hand
sincerity
is
about
recognizing
that
the
company
lives
in
a
world
that
goes
beyond
its
own
borders
it
is
about
deeply
considering
its
impact
on
the
planet
being
selfconscious
purposeful
and
going
beyond
the
numbers
to
confirm
and
express
its
true
nature
being
sincere
means
knowing
that
there
is
a
pathway
to
live
and
work
by
its
values
down
to
every
detail
in
this
way
a
company
can
become
a
genuine
and
inspiring
brand

authenticity
and
sincerity
capisci
another
important
issue
to
consider
is
that
authenticity
is
an
innate
behavior
and
sincerity
is
an
acquired
one
babies
are
authentic
kids
learn
to
behave
sincerely
the
same
can
happen
with
companies
business
authenticity
is
a
broader
definition
that
considers
the
entire
spectrum
of
being
true
to
itself
while
sincerity
is
more
focused
brings
wisdom
care
and
a
greater
perspective
than
its
own
people
believe
in
honest
brands
it
is
good
business
to
be
true
to
what
the
company
is
allowing
the
public
to
recognize
how
it
behaves
with
a
conscience
although
in
addition
society
demands
a
positive
social
and
environmental
impact
from
the
company
this
does
not
mean
that
profit
motives
which
are
necessary
are
hidden
as
a
falsely
sincere
attitude
it
is
valid
to
recognize
the
need
to
“
make
money
”
whilst
being
sympathetic
to
the
audience
in
the
way
a
company
communicates
that
s
sincerity
brands
trying
to
navigate
this
new
world
of
conscience
and
sincerity
should
act
differently
deeply
believing
in
the
way
they
think
in
the
values
they
defend
doing
the
right
thing
and
being
honest
about
their
motivations
“
behaving
truthfully
and
being
unapologetically
driven
by
values
are
two
of
the
essential
characteristics
that
today
s
society
is
demanding
from
each
institution
”
if
being
honest
and
conscious
brings
on
a
deeper
layer
of
seriousness
and
respect
being
conscious
of
others
helps
take
it
to
the
next
level
one
that
is
increasingly
demanded
by
all
stakeholders
including
citizens
“
is
your
company
radically
honest
”
i
asked
him
“
of
course
it
is
we
ve
always
been
honest
”
he
lied
to
me
conscientious
purpose
is
an
inherent
part
of
business
from
the
beginning
of
time
purpose
is
born
with
any
enterprise
expressing
its
raison
d
être
–
even
adam
eve
lilith
and
the
apple
thus
the
purpose
must
be
companyconnected
and
its
fit
is
achieved
because
the
strategic
aims
are
born
from
and
aligned
with
such
business
see
alsohow
brands
can
put
purpose
at
the
heart
of
their
marketing
strategy
the
challenge
for
the
leadership
team
is
to
first
understand
the
real
and
deepest
meaning
of
purpose
translating
it
into
an
actionable
mission
and
vision
it
is
a
matter
of
alignment
coherence
and
consistency
these
are
the
basis
of
a
company
s
better
performance
not
only
in
terms
of
achieving
better
economic
and
financial
results
but
also
in
generating
a
positive
impact
a
conscientious
purpose
must
be
integrated
into
all
aspects
of
how
companies
do
business
as
life
purpose
is
understood
backwards
but
it
must
be
lived
forwards
this
means
that
if
purpose
changes
the
company
must
change
–
essentially
because
it
must
be
reimagined
redesigned
and
restarted
to
live
a
new
aspirational
future
this
is
a
key
point
that
is
often
misunderstood
making
a
conscientious
purpose
explicit
is
a
good
first
step
to
be
practical
a
good
first
step
is
to
make
the
purpose
explicit
and
if
it
is
already
there
to
ensure
that
it
really
is
the
reason
for
the
company
s
existence
and
not
a
good
narrative
invented
by
the
marketing
or
communication
areas
“
holy
graf
zeppelin
batman
”
unfortunately
we
tend
to
produce
such
conceptual
monstrosities
far
too
often
deal
with
it
if
the
purpose
of
the
business
is
only
to
make
money
that
s
what
it
is
as
mentioned
before
it
can
change
but
it
will
imply
that
a
new
business
was
born
see
alsogood
enough
isn
t
good
enough
to
reinforce
deepen
and
above
all
be
driven
by
a
purpose
in
addition
to
making
it
explicit
companies
must
continuously
translate
it
into
precise
business
objectives
associated
with
it
and
in
turn
the
latter
must
be
translated
into
visible
actions
and
behaviors
this
ensures
executive
responsiveness
to
the
company
s
key
audiences
and
becomes
the
trigger
for
exceptional
transformation
and
growth
the
obvious
steps
sorry
but
i
must
insist
on
this
to
make
purpose
a
meaningful
daytoday
experience
are
think
act
and
say
–
in
that
order
measure
the
impact
of
how
the
company
acts
on
purpose
make
the
leadership
team
accountable
ensure
that
all
stakeholders
understand
and
share
that
company
s
reason
for
existence
build
the
company
s
symbols
rituals
and
stories
around
it
brand
and
purpose
brands
with
a
conscience
branding
aims
at
building
a
realistic
meaning
of
the
company
in
its
interaction
with
people
independently
but
including
the
role
they
play
as
citizens
in
addition
when
the
purpose
includes
the
impact
on
society
and
the
environment
the
brand
as
a
business
platform
helps
prove
the
consciousness
of
the
company
not
to
mention
internal
issues
of
governance
and
responsible
investments
when
stakeholders
understand
live
and
share
what
the
company
stands
for
and
why
that
matters
the
results
come
on
their
own
without
out
of
the
ordinary
efforts
that
s
why
i
said
at
the
very
beginning
of
this
article
that
companies
that
act
in
line
with
their
purpose
create
value
generate
superior
results
and
could
even
have
a
positive
impact

why
brands
need
longterm
commitment
to
building
credibility
with
david
aaker
if
the
company
can
t
deliver
on
purpose
its
brand
promise
is
basically
empty
nonsense
three
questions
arise
where
are
your
company
and
your
brand
on
this
journey
towards
brands
with
a
conscience
is
the
company
s
purpose
explicit
and
does
it
need
to
be
transformed
is
the
company
ready
for
a
transformation
that
will
lead
to
growth
into
both
results
and
impact

what
is
freedom
of
conscience
and
why
does
it
matter
what
is
“
conscience
”
it
s
a
word
we
re
all
familiar
with
—
a
clear
conscience
a
guilty
conscience
—
even
if
we
can
t
pinpoint
an
exact
definition
the
concept
pops
up
in
all
kinds
of
places
in
saturday
morning
cartoons
where
good
guys
consult
an
angel
on
their
right
shoulder
conscience
and
a
devil
on
their
left
shoulder
temptation
before
making
a
decision
in
literary
masterpieces
like
crime
and
punishment
where
the
main
character
suffers
from
overwhelming
guilt
after
committing
a
crime
and
in
popular
movies
like
star
wars
where
darth
vader
chooses
to
do
one
final
good
act
after
a
lifetime
of
evil
but
none
of
these
examples
capture
the
full
concept
of
conscience
as
americans
we
should
consider
the
true
meaning
of
“
conscience
”
we
should
also
recognize
the
importance
—
and
privilege
—
of
having
the
freedom
of
conscience
america
was
founded
on
this
freedom
and
it
s
worth
preserving
today
read
on
to
find
out
why
what
is
freedom
of
conscience
conscience
is
our
godgiven
ability
to
discern
right
from
wrong
good
from
evil
but
it
s
more
than
that
for
knowing
right
from
wrong
wouldn
t
do
much
good
if
we
didn
t
or
couldn
t
act
on
what
s
right
so
conscience
also
includes
the
ability
to
apply
laws
rules
and
intuitions
in
the
right
way
in
other
words
to
act
on
what
we
believe
a
rural
church
is
seen
in
a
field
the
first
amendment
protects
our
public
witness
we
can
put
our
faith
in
action
by
serving
others
where
is
freedom
of
conscience
found
in
the
constitution
america
s
founders
understood
the
gravity
of
protecting
the
freedom
of
conscience
james
madison
called
conscience
“
the
most
sacred
of
all
property
”
thomas
jefferson
said
that
no
“
provision
in
our
constitution
ought
to
be
dearer
to
man
than
that
which
protects
the
rights
of
conscience
against
”
the
government
and
during
the
debate
over
what
would
become
the
first
amendment
many
lawmakers
proposed
protecting
the
rights
of
conscience
this
understanding
shaped
the
first
amendment
although
the
amendment
doesn
t
explicitly
mention
“
conscience
”
it
protects
its
animating
features
religious
freedom
and
free
speech
the
first
amendment
says
“
congress
shall
make
no
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion
or
prohibiting
the
free
exercise
thereof
or
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech
or
of
the
press
”
why
is
freedom
of
conscience
important
these
26
words
protect
the
freedom
of
conscience
—
the
freedom
to
believe
without
coercion
and
to
speak
and
act
consistently
with
those
beliefs
that
freedom
begins
internally
the
government
cannot
force
us
to
act
contrary
to
our
beliefs
believe
what
we
otherwise
wouldn
t
or
to
say
things
to
which
we
object
so
we
have
the
freedom
to
think
reason
speak
stay
silent
about
and
hold
certain
beliefs
without
fearing
government
punishment
that
protects
our
private
conscience
but
our
internal
beliefs
often
move
us
to
act
publicly
so
the
first
amendment
also
protects
our
public
witness
we
can
put
our
faith
in
action
by
serving
others
we
can
try
to
persuade
others
of
our
views
by
publicly
expressing
them
and
we
can
join
communities
of
people
—
like
churches
nonprofits
and
other
associations
—
that
share
our
beliefs
the
first
amendment
also
protects
the
freedom
to
act
in
several
ways
religious
freedom
ensures
a
private
sphere
within
which
religious
bodies
may
govern
themselves
and
instruct
their
congregants
according
to
their
own
beliefs
that
freedom
preserves
the
integrity
of
those
beliefs
for
future
generations
and
the
freedom
of
speech
recognizes
that
voices
are
often
louder
when
expressed
together
so
we
can
join
with
likeminded
people
to
amplify
the
messages
and
values
we
want
to
promote
it
may
be
easy
to
take
these
freedoms
for
granted
but
not
every
country
has
them
consider
france
a
country
that
generally
discourages
acts
and
symbols
of
faith
in
the
public
sphere
there
for
example
muslim
girls
cannot
wear
religious
head
coverings
in
school
but
other
girls
can
wear
head
scarfs
for
fashion
in
france
that
s
laïcité
in
america
that
s
religious
discrimination
the
freedom
to
act
on
our
beliefs
is
important
because
community
standards
—
or
lack
thereof
—
reflect
individuals
conscience
the
more
we
train
our
conscience
to
do
what
is
right
the
better
off
we
will
be
but
we
lose
our
ability
to
discern
right
from
wrong
the
more
we
consistently
ignore
our
conscience
the
freedom
of
conscience
has
also
benefitted
america
s
common
good
because
of
this
freedom
religious
organizations
have
founded
and
currently
operate
countless
hospitals
homeless
shelters
adoption
agencies
community
centers
and
other
public
services
pastors
have
condemned
social
ills
like
racism
and
violence
and
religious
people
are
more
likely
to
volunteer
their
time
and
contribute
their
money
to
all
sorts
of
charitable
causes
religious
and
secular
alike

some
court
cases
dealing
with
freedom
of
conscience
the
freedom
of
conscience
is
worth
preserving
several
court
cases
seek
to
do
and
have
done
just
that
consider
three
contexts
1
the
freedom
of
artists
to
speak
according
to
their
beliefs
2
the
freedom
of
medical
providers
to
decline
to
provide
medical
procedures
that
violate
their
conscience
3
the
freedom
of
faithbased
publicservice
ministries
to
operate
in
line
with
their
religious
purpose
freedom
of
conscience
for
artists
for
almost
eighty
years
the
u
s
supreme
court
has
recognized
that
compelling
someone
to
express
a
message
they
disagree
with
is
unconstitutional
even
so
artists
are
still
being
threatened
today
for
declining
to
convey
ideas
that
violate
their
beliefs
for
example
jack
phillips
of
masterpiece
cakeshop
has
been
targeted
three
times
for
declining
to
create
custom
cakes
that
promote
ideas
about
human
sexuality
that
he
doesn
t
believe
jack
s
first
case
ended
in
a
major
victory
at
the
u
s
supreme
court
more
recently
jack
won
another
victory
when
the
colorado
supreme
court
dismissed
a
lawsuit
brought
against
him
adf

a

she
creates

messages
she
s
passionate
about
and
wants
to
expand
to
include
custom
websites
that
celebrate
marriages
between
one
man
and
one
woman
but
lorie
lives
in
colorado
and
colorado
was
trying
to
misuse
one
of
its
laws
to
force
her
to
create
websites
promoting
messages
that
contradict
her
beliefs
about
marriage
unwilling
to
violate
the
law
or
her
conscience
lorie
challenged
the
law
to
protect
the
cherished
freedom
to
speak
consistently
with
her
religious
views
on
marriage
 
in
june
2023
the
supreme
court
ruled
that
colorado
could
not
use
its
law
to
coerce
lorie
to
express
a
message
that
violated
her
beliefs
the
court
said
that
the
first
amendment
protects
lorie
s
freedom
to
decide
which
messages
she
wants
to
express
and
that
includes
the
freedom
to
design
wedding
websites
consistent
with
her
religious
beliefs
about
marriage
elsewhere
across
the
country
artists
as
diverse
as
florists
and
custom
print
shops
have
been
forced
to
choose
between
their
faith
and
their
craft
just
as
colorado
tried
to
force
lorie
to
do
but
fortunately
the
first
amendment
makes
that
choice
a
false
dichotomy
following
the
first
amendment
courts
have
protected
the
freedoms
of
filmmakers
calligraphers
and
a
photographer
to
create
artwork
proclaiming
their
views
on
marriage
another
court
likewise
ensured
that
a
christian
philosophy
professor
could
talk
about
gender
identity
consistent
with
his
belief
about
the
immutability
of
sex
lorie
s
victory
reaffirms
that
the
supreme
court
still
believes
in
the
importance
of
a
free
conscience
that
s
how
it
should
be
every
american
has
the
right
to
speak
freely
that
s
why
lorie
found
support
from
a
diverse
group
of
artists
—
from
a
worldrenowned
graphic
designer
to
a
christian
tattoo
artist
a
muslim
wedding
photographer
and
a
cake
artist
who
hold
different
views
about
marriage
freedom
of
conscience
for
healthcare
professionals
beyond
speech
the
freedom
of
conscience
is
imperative
in
the
medical
field
since
ancient
times
physicians
have
sworn
to
“
do
no
harm
”
to
their
patients
fast
forward
to
present
day
and
professional
medical
ethics
acknowledge
the
rights
of
professionals
to
decline
to
provide
medical
treatment
that
violates
their
conscience
the
justification
echoes
the
first
amendment
—
to
preserve
the
personal
integrity
of
the
medical
provider
and
the
overall
integrity
of
the
medical
profession
but
not
everyone
sees
it
that
way
in
christian
healthcare
centers
v
nessel
for
example
adf
represents
a
michigan
faithbased
medical
nonprofit
organization
that
provides
highquality
health
care
to
all
and
offers
substantially
reduced
prices
for
patients
with
lower
incomes
but
a
michigan
law
requires
christian
healthcare
to
prescribe
crosssex
hormones
to
facilitate
efforts
to
alter
a
patient
s
biological
sex
doing
so
violates
the
ministry
s
religious
beliefs
and
undermines
its
ability
to
provide
safe
health
care
to
its
community
so
the
ministry
challenged
the
law
to
safeguard
its
freedom
to
operate
consistent
with
its
beliefs
likewise
in
state
of
texas
and
mayo
pharmacy
v
hhs
adf
represents
mayo
pharmacy
a
pharmacy
in
north
dakota
that
practices
consistent
with
its
catholic
faith
the
pharmacy
is
challenging
a
regulation
that
requires
it
to
dispense
drugs
prescribed
to
induce
abortions
against
its
religious
convictions
in
july
2023
a
federal
district
court
ruled
that
the
case
must
proceed
freedom
of
conscience
for
faithbased
ministries
the
freedom
of
conscience
allows
faithbased
ministries
to
provide
other
public
services
to
care
for
the
most
vulnerable
among
us
for
example
adf
has
twice
defended
downtown
hope
center
a
christian
nonprofit
organization
in
anchorage
alaska
the
hope
center
offers
meals
job
training
and
clothing
for
homeless
men
and
women
and
serves
as
an
overnight
shelter
for
women
—
many
of
whom
are
trying
to
escape
from
abusive
situations
and
even
from
sex
trafficking
and
adf
represented
new
hope
family
services
in
new
york
for
almost
sixty
years
new
hope
has
helped
to
place
more
than
1000
children
into
loving
adoptive
homes
throughout
the
state
it
does
so
because
of
its
religious
conviction
that
christians
are
called
to
look
after
the
needy
—
especially
children
a
court
recently
protected
new
hope
s
ability
to
continue
to
care
for
these
children
and
their
families
according
to
its
religious
beliefs
these
ministries
provide
critical
services
to
their
communities
and
they
do
so
because
of
their
religious
beliefs
this
is
a
common
feature
of
american
history
made
possible
by
the
freedom
of
conscience
in
that
way
protecting
the
ability
of
these
ministries
to
live
out
their
faith
ensures
that
other
religious
organizations
can
do
the
same
while
contributing
to
the
common
good
conclusion
by
now
we
ve
answered
the
original
question
—
what
is
conscience
and
we
ve
answered
another
—
why
is
freedom
of
conscience
worth
preserving
in
the
end
this
freedom
recognizes
the
inherent
dignity
of
each
person
as
created
in
god
s
image
and
endowed
with
the
godgiven
capacity
to
make
moral
judgments
we
all
benefit
from
that
freedom

alito
joined
by
chief
justice
john
roberts
and
justice
clarence
thomas
dissented
writing
that
“
the

here
reflect
antipathy

beliefs
that

not
accord
with

of
those
holding

”
2526
in
201427
and
201628
senator
cory
booker
introduced
the
“
access
to
birth
control
act
”
bill
which
would
require
all
pharmacists
in
the
united
states
to
provide
emergency
contraception
responses
edit
health
care
providers
opposed
to
abortion
or
contraception
support
the
clauses
because
they
believe
that
disciplinary
or
legal
action
for
refusing
to
perform
services
obliges
providers
to
supply
services
which
their
moral
or
religious
principles
forbid
reproductive
rights
organizations
such
as
planned
parenthood
and
naral
prochoice
america
oppose
the
provision
because
they
maintain
that
pharmacists
doctors
and
hospitals
have
a
professional
duty
to
fulfill
patients
legal
medical
needs
regardless
of
their
own
ethical
stances
opponents
see
conscience
clauses
as
an
attempt
to
limit
reproductive
rights
in
lieu
of
bans
struck
down
by
supreme
court
rulings
such
as
roe
v
wade
29
though
the
case
has
been
overturned
by
dobbs
v
jackson
women
s
health
organization
as
a
result
the
term
conscience
clause
is
controversial
and
primarily
used
by
those
who
support
these
provisions
those
who
oppose
them
often
prefer
to
use
the
term
refusal
clause
implying
that
those
who
exercise
the
clauses
are
refusing
to
treat
a
patient
in
2018
roger
severino
the
thendirector
of
the
office
for
civil
rights
at
the
united
states
department
of
health
and
human
services
criticized
those
who
oppose
conscience
clauses
saying
“
there
s
a
movement
that
tries
to
squelch
dissent
on
the
question
of
abortion
so
that
those
that
stand
up
for
life
are
being
systematically
driven
out
of
the
medical
profession
”
he
also
stated
that
“
nobody
should
be
fired
from
their
position
as
a
medical
professional
because
they
refuse
to
participate
in
the
taking
of
a
human
life
in
abortion
it
s
illegal
if
you
receive
federal
funds
you
may
expect
an
enforcement
action
from
the
hhs
office
for
civil
rights
if
you
do
such
a
thing
”
30
catholic
doctrine
edit
the
conscience
clause
is
widely
invoked
in
catholic
universities
hospitals
and
agencies
because
the
catholic
church
opposes
abortion
contraceptives
sterilization
and
embryonic
stem
cell
treatments
opponents
of
related
foca
legislation
have
interpreted
the
possible
end
of
the
conscience
clause
as
a
demand
to
either
do
abortions
or
close
31
timothy
dolan
has
said
“
in
effect
the
president
is
saying
we
have
a
year
to
figure
out
how
to
violate
our
consciences
32
however
conscience
clauses
are
sometimes
interpreted
differently
and
their
use
will
often
depend
on
the
given
context
33
three
members
of
the
department
of
obstetrics
gynecology
and
reproductive
sciences
and
the
bixby
center
for
global
reproductive
health
at
ucsf
have
questioned
whether
conscience
clauses
are
ethical
writing
in
a
journal
article
that
in
some
catholicowned
hospitals
the
private
patient
–
physician
relationship
patient
safety
and
patient
comfort
are
compromised
by
religious
mandates
that
require
physicians
to
act
contrary
to
the
current
standard
of
care
in
miscarriage
management

although
they
do
not
as
such
have
the
status
of

a
comprehensive
legislative
package
that
was
a
priority
of
gov
ron
desantis
this
analysis
of
sb
1580
will
attempt
to
explain
how
these
two
new
provisions
affect
the
practice
of
medicine
right
of
medical
conscience
sb
1580
creates
a
new
section
of
the
florida
statutes
¹
that
gives
health
care
providers
and
health
care
payors
the
right
to
“
opt
out
of
participation
in
or
payment
for
any
health
care
service
on
the
basis
of
a
consciencebased
objection
”
it
is
important
to
note
that
this
right
of
conscience
only
applies
to
a
“
health
care
service
”
it
does
not
give
a
health
care
provider
the
right
to
refuse
to
perform
job
requirements
that
do
not
involve
the
provision
of
a
health
care
service
or
the
right
to
refuse
to
provide
a
health
care
service
to
a
particular
class
of
individuals
“
health
care
service
”
is
defined
to
mean
medical
research
medical
procedures
or
medical
services
including
but
not
limited
to
testing
diagnosis
referral
dispensing
or
administering
any
drug
medication
or
device
psychological
therapy
or
counseling
research
therapy
recordmaking
procedures
set
up
or
performance
of
a
surgery
or
procedure
or
any
other
care
or
services
performed
or
provided
by
any
health
care
provider
if
a
health
care
provider
has
a
consciencebased
objection
to
performing
abortions
the
provider
may
not
be
discriminated
against
or
suffer
adverse
action
for
refusing
to
perform
abortions
however
a
provider
may
not
choose
to
perform
abortions
for
some
patients
but
not
for
other
patients
based
on
the
patient
s
race
color
religion
sex
or
national
origin
the
right
of
conscience
is
solely
attached
to
a
specific
health
care
service
a
provider
can
refuse
to
prescribe
contraceptives
to
hisher
patients
but
cannot
refuse
to
prescribe
contraceptives
to
only
medicaid
recipients
a
provider
who
elects
to
provide
a
particular
medical
procedure
to
hisher
patients
may
not
refuse
to
provide
that
procedure
to
a
subset
of
patients
who
engage
in
a
certain
type
of
behavior
even
if
the
provider
has
a
consciencebased
objection
to
that
behavior
while
the
bill
sponsors
made
it
clear
as
to
what
the
right
of
conscience
applies
to
they
left
the
issue
of
whether
a
conscientious
objection
exists
less
certain
sb
1580
defines
a
“
consciencebased
objection
”
as
an
objection
based
on
a
sincerely
held
religious
moral
or
ethical
belief
²
as
noted
in
the
footnote
whether
an
entity
such
as
an
insurance
company
has
a
conscience
is
determined
by
existing
written
evidence
if
the
articles
of
incorporation
for
an
insurer
state
that
the
company
exists
to
provide
health
insurance
for
individuals
whose
religion
forbids
the
use
of
birth
control
then
that
insurer
will
be
safe
from
adverse
action
for
selling
insurance
policies
that
do
not
provide
coverage
for
birth
control
unless
of
course
there
is
a
contrary
federal
requirement
if
the
company
cannot
produce
a
governing
document
published
guideline
or
set
of
policies
or
regulations
it
will
not
be
entitled
to
assert
a
right
of
conscience
individual
health
care
providers
³
on
the
other
hand
do
not
have
to
produce
written
evidence
attesting
to
a
sincerely
held
religious
moral
or
ethical
belief
apparently
it
will
be
up
to
the
florida
attorney
general
as
the
entity
given
enforcement
authority
for
this
statute
to
determine
whether
a
health
care
provider
alleging
a
violation
has
a
valid
consciencebased
objection
presumably
the
attorney
general
will
assess
a
provider
s
selfprofessed
belief
on
a
casebycase
basis
in
a
manner
congruent
with
the
inquiry
used
for
similar
laws
such
as
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
requiring
employers
to
provide
an
accommodation
for
employee
s
sincerely
held
religious
beliefs
health
care
providers
and
payors
who
wish
to
opt
out
of
participation
in
or
payment
for
a
health
care
service
due
to
a
consciencebased
objection
must
do
the
following
at
the
time
of
the
objection
or
as
soon
as
practicable
provide
written
notice
of
the
objection
to
the
provider
s
supervisor
or
employer
as
applicable
document
the
objection
to
the
particular
health
care
service
in
the
patient
s
medical
file
notify
patients
seeking
an
appointment
for
a
health
care
service
that
the
provider
has
a
consciencebased
objection
to
of
that
objection
before
scheduling
the
appointment
providers
who
are
students
must
provide
written
notice
of
their
consciencebased
objection
to
the
educational
institution
at
the
time
the
objection
is
made
or
as
soon
as
practicable
providers
who
comply
with
these
requirements
may
not
be
discriminated
against
⁴
or
suffer
adverse
action
⁵
for
exercising
their
right
of
medical
conscience
the
right
of
medical
conscience
section
also
includes
speech
and
whistleblower
protections
which
prohibit
discriminating
or
taking
adverse
action
against
health
care
providers
or
payors
who
report
violations
of
the
new
right
of
medical
conscience
statute
this
protection
is
extended
to
providers
who
testify
assist
or
participate
in
a
proceeding
brought
by
the
attorney
general
to
determine
if
a
violation
occurred
interestingly
this
part
of
the
new
law
also
includes
a
prohibition
on
discriminating
against
a
health
care
provider
or
payor
for
reasons
not
related
to
the
right
of
medical
conscience
protection
from
discrimination
is
extended
to
the
disclosure
of
information
the
provider
or
payor
reasonably
believes
constitutes
a
violation
of
any
law
rule
or
regulation
a
violation
of
any
ethical
guidelines
for
the
provision
of
any
medical
procedure
or
service
or
a
practice
or
method
of
treatment
that
may
put
patient
health
at
risk
or
present
substantial
and
specific
danger
to
public
health
and
safety
this
protection
appears
to
be
very
broad
and
could
potentially
provide
protection
in
situations
as
varied
as
physicians
who
complain
about
health
insurance
prior
authorization
procedures
or
physicians
who
notify
a
hospital
of
violations
of
medical
staff
bylaws
under
the
original
house
companion
to
sb
1580
health
care
providers
and
payors
were
given
a
civil
cause
of
action
for
any
violation
of
the
right
of
conscience
section
sb
1580
however
rejected
this
approach
in
favor
of
allowing
the
attorney
general
to
investigate
complaints
and
bring
a
civil
action
for
damages
injunctive
or
other
appropriate
relief
and
attorney
fees
health
care
providers
and
payors
who
decline
to
participate
in
or
pay
for
a
health
care
service
because
of
a
consciencebased
objection
may
not
be
held
civilly
liable
on
that
basis
alone
finally
acknowledging
the
existence
of
federal
emtala
requirements
the
legislature
specifically
stated
that
the
medical
conscience
section
does
not
override
any
state
or
federal
requirement
to
provide
emergency
medical
treatment
use
of
free
speech
by
a
health
care
practitioner
a
bill
to
ensure
the
use
of
free
speech
by
a
health
care
practitioner
was
filed
as
a
standalone
bill
during
the
2022
session
hb
687sb
1184
despite
support
from
the
governor
the
bills
never
made
it
to
the
house
or
senate
floor
the
free
speech
concept
in
a
different
form
was
combined
with
the
right
of
conscience
issue
in
sb
1580
passed
out
of
both
chambers
and
was
approved
by
the
governor
less
than
a
week
after
the
end
of
session
this
scaled
down
version
prohibits
a
licensing
board
or
the
department
of
health
if
there
is
no
board
from
taking
disciplinary
action
against
a
health
care
practitioner
⁶
solely
because
the
practitioner
has
spoken
or
written
publicly
about
a
health
care
service
or
public
policy
this
includes
postings
on
social
media
this
protection
does
not
apply
to
speech
written
communications
or
social
media
postings
that
the
provider
uses
to
provide
medical
advice
or
treatment
to
a
specific
patient
the
protection
from
board
discipline
also
does
not
apply
to
speech
or
written
communication
that
separately
violates
a
different
law
or
rule
thus
a
health
care
practitioner
can
basically
say
anything
they
like
about
health
care
or
public
policy
regardless
of
whether
the
assertion
reflects
the
actual
standard
of
care
or
is
based
on
sound
scientific
principles
as
long
as
it
is
not
made
to
a
specific
patient
as
part
of
the
medical
care
of
that
patient
unlike
the
2022
version
there
are
no
provisions
that
would
impose
sanctions
on
a
board
that
violated
this
provision
part
of
the
impetus
for
this
new
right
of
practitioner
free
speech
is
the
alleged
actions
of
the
american
board
of
medical
specialties
abms
in
dealing
with
physicians
who
advocated
for
alternative
treatments
for
covid19
or
questioned
the
safety
of
covid
vaccines
to
correct
this
perceived
overreach
the
free
speech
section
of
sb
1580
includes
a
provision
that
discourages
an
approved
boardcertification
recognizing
agency
from
revoking
the
certification
of
a
health
care
practitioner
for
speaking
or
writing
about
a
health
care
service
or
public
policy
as
with
the
licensing
boards
this
protection
applies
to
postings
on
social
media
but
does
not
apply
to
speech
that
constitutes
medical
advice
or
treatment
to
a
specific
patient
a
specialty
board
that
revokes
the
certification
of
a
provider
solely
because
the
provider
exercised
their
free
speech
rights
under
this
section
may
have
their
approval
revoked
by
the
issuing
board
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
specialty
boards
of
the
abms
are
recognized
by
statute
and
not
the
board
of
medicine
⁷
as
the
bom
only
has
the
authority
to
revoke
the
approval
from
a
recognizing
agency
that
it
has
approved
it
appears
that
the
bom
does
not
have
the
authority
to
hold
an
abms
specialty
board
accountable
for
actions
taken
in
violation

freedom
of
conscience
is
one
of
the
fundamental
freedoms
protected
by
section
2
of
the
 
canadian
charter
of
rights
and
freedoms
1
what
is
the
legal
impact
of
this
freedom
ultimately
the
freedom
of
conscience
constitutionally
recognizes
“
the
centrality
of
individual
conscience
and
the
inappropriateness
of
governmental
intervention
to
constrain
its
manifestation
”
2
 
in
fact
the
supreme
court
has
ruled
that
“
an
emphasis
on
individual
conscience
and
individual
judgment
lies
at
the
heart
of
our
democratic
political
tradition
the
ability
of
each
citizen
to
make
free
and
informed
decisions
is
the
absolute
prerequisite
for
the
legitimacy
acceptability
and
efficacy
of
our
system
of
self
‑
government
”
3
what
is
legally
protected
from
government
interference
the
only
supreme
court
case
considering
the
freedom
of
conscience
directly
is
 
r
v
morgentaler
4
this
1988
case
dealt
with
the
constitutionality
of
abortion
laws
justice
wilson
stated
“
the
decision
whether
or
not
to
terminate
a
pregnancy
is
essentially
a
moral
decision
and
the
conscience
of
the
individual
must
be
paramount
”
5
 
she
also
held
that
the
freedoms
guaranteed
by
section
2a
“
should
be
broadly
construed
to
extend
to
conscientiouslyheld
beliefs
whether
grounded
in
religion
or
in
a
secular
morality
”
6
 
however
since
justice
wilson
opposed
the
majority
decision
of
the
court
her
judgment
is
not
considered
a
settled
statement
of
the
law
without
guidance
from
the
supreme
court
lower
courts
have
had
to
figure
out
on
their
own
what
the
freedom
of
conscience
protects
from
the
limited
jurisprudence
that
exists
we
know
“
the
guarantee
of
freedom
of
conscience
is
directed
at
an
individual
s
overarching
normative
value
system
”
7
 
if
a
person
s
actions
are
not
motivated
by
a
“
comprehensive
value
system
”
in
a
secular
context
 
then
they
are
not
protected
by
section
2a
8
 
this
can
be
quite
limiting
when
people
have
argued
that
their
freedom
of
conscience
was
violated
by
mandatory
seatbelt
laws
for
example
their
arguments
failed
because
their
objections
were
not
supported
by
a
comprehensive
value
system
insubstantial
infringements
upon
a
person
s
conscience
are
also
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
guarantee
9
 
this
is
a
limitation
that
all
the
fundamental
freedoms
share
the
 
freedom
of
religion
 
for
instance
does
not
extend
to
protect
against
trivial
infringements
upon
a
person
s
religious
practice
10
one
of
the
few
lower
court
decisions
solely
considering
the
freedom
of
conscience
rather
than
conscience
and
religion
together
was
 
maurice
v
canada
attorney
general
11
mr
maurice
wanted
to
receive
vegetarian
meals
in
prison
originally
he
was
provided
with
these
meals
in
recognition
of
his
 
freedom
of
religion
however
when
he
renounced
his
religious
beliefs
the
prison
stopped
providing
vegetarian
meals
he
successfully
claimed
that
since
he
remained
vegetarian
for
conscientious
reasons
this
was
a
violation
of
his
freedom
of
conscience
12
 
the
federal
court
agreed
declaring
that
the
“
charter
 
entitles
the
applicant
to
a
vegetarian
diet
”
13
the
freedom
of
conscience
garnered
some
attention
in
2015
when
the
supreme
court
decided
 
carter
v
canada
attorney
general
in
that
case
a
number
of
interveners
claimed
that
providing
access
to
physicianassisted
dying
would
infringe
the
freedom
of
conscience
of
medical
professionals
14
 
this
argument
went
beyond
the
scope
of
what
needed
to
be
decided
in
that
case
however
the
court
noted
that
physicianassisted
dying
was
indeed
a
“
matter
of
conscience
”
and
that
at
some
point
“
the
 
charter
rights
of

the
modern
misunderstanding
of
conscience
the
catholic
church
teaches
that
the
conscience
is
a
natural
facility
of
our
reason
that
directs
us
to
do
good
and
avoid
evil
that
makes
judgments
about
the
good
and
evil
of
particular
acts
and
that
bears
witness
after
the
fact
to
the
good
or
evil
that
we
have
done
such
as
what
we
call
“
having
a
guilty
conscience
”
¹
a
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
the
role
of
the
human
conscience
lies
at
the
root
of
many
of
the
problems
in
the
catholic
church
today
very
few
catholics
even
know
what
that
role
actually
is
when
pressed
many
will
say
something
along
the
lines
of
“
if
my
conscience
tells
me
that
a
particular
action
is
all
right
i
can
do
it
”
this
is
just
another
way
of
saying
“
if
it
feels
good
do
it
”
if
an
improperlyformed
conscience
leads
a
person
to
accept
something
as
right
and
good
based
simply
on
his
or
her
uninformed
opinions
and
feelings
that
person
will
fall
into
grave
errors
for
which
there
is
no
good
excuse
before
god
when
gentiles
who
have
not
the
law
do
by
nature
what
the
law
requires
they
are
a
law
to
themselves
even
though
they
do
not
have
the
law
they
show
that
what
the
law
requires
is
written
on
their
hearts
while
their
conscience
also
bears
witness
and
their
conflicting
thoughts
accuse
or
perhaps
excuse
them
on
that
day
when
according
to
my
gospel
god
judges
the
secrets
of
men
by
christ
jesus
romans
21415
many
catholics
erroneously
believe
that
the
conscience
is
a
teacher
not
a
pupil
that
it
is
the
source
of
morality
this
is
not
the
teaching
of
the
catholic
church
according
to
the
church
the
conscience
is
a
witness
to
the
moral
law
authored
by
god
each
catholic
is
required
to
obey
that
moral
law
in
all
things
the
conscience
if
properly
formed
calls
him
to
obey
that
moral
law
and
helps
him
to
understand
how
to
apply
it
in
particular
cases
this
is
why
the
cultivation
of
the
cardinal
virtue
of
prudence
is
essential
as
the
catechism
teaches
“
man
strives
to
interpret
the
data
of
experience
and
the
signs
of
the
times
assisted
by
the
virtue
of
prudence
by
the
advice
of
competent
people
and
by
the
help
of
the
holy
spirit
and
his
gifts

result
a
deformed
belief
system
the
belief
that
the
conscience
is
a
moral
authority
in
its
own
right
has
resulted
in
catholics
supporting
and
promoting
many
intrinsic
evils
including
contraception
sterilization
abortion
homosexual
activity
pornography
and
euthanasia
many
organizations
vigorously
promote
this
false
understanding
of
the
human
conscience
in
order
to
gain
more
support
from
catholic
laity
one
of
these
groups
is
“
catholics
”
for
choice
cfc
whose
mission
consists
of
attempting
to
convince
people
that
they
can
be
proabortion
and
still
be
“
good
catholics
”
in
its
quarterly
magazine
ironically
entitled
conscience
cfc
attempts
to
legitimize
the
obvious
paradox
that
“
church
law
affirms
both
the
right
and
the
responsibility
of
a
catholic
to
follow
his
or
her
conscience
even
when
it
conflicts
with
church
teaching
”
²
emphasis
added
cfc
also
alleges
the
catholic
church
officially
teaches
that
the
conscience
of
an
individual
is
supreme
if
you
carefully
examine
your
conscience
and
then
decide
that
an
abortion
is
the
most
moral
act
you
can
do
at
this
time
you
are
not
committing
a
sin
therefore
you
are
not
excommunicated
nor
need
you
tell
it
in
confession
since
in
your
case
abortion
is
not
a
sin
³
it
is
easy
to
demonstrate
that
cfc
does
not
really
believe
this
principle
itself
for
example
would
it
concede
that
it
was
legitimate
for
someone
to
“
carefully
examine
their
conscience
”
and
then
decide
that
torching
an
abortion
clinic
in
the
middle
of
the
night
was
“
the
most
moral
act
they
could
do
at
this
time
”
obviously
not
this
is
a
fundamental
error
and
are
many
examples
of
how
it
naturally
carries
over
into
other
moral
issues
teresa
kelly
a
member
of
toronto
s
catholic
school
board
recently
said
that
being
part
of
a
gaystraight
alliance
whose
purpose
is
to
disseminate
homophile
propaganda
in
the
schools
is
“
the
embodiment
of

perfectlyformed

how
does

relate
to
morality
in
order
for
a
person
s
conscience
to
be
conditioned
to
accept
evil
it
must
first
decisively
turn
away
from
god
s
teachings
and
decide
that
it
can
determine
for
itself
what
is
right
and
wrong
ignoring
all
external
and
objective
standards
if
necessary
in
order
to
reach
the
desired
conclusion
this
means
that
dissenters
must
justify
their
claims
by
assuming
that
there
is
no
fixed
morality
that
is
binding
on
all
persons
the
only
source
of
morality
is
the
conscience
of
each
individual
one
phrase
that
is
coming
into
common
usage
among
the
selfappointed
elite
is
“
this
is
my
truth
”
however
the
intrinsic
flaw
with
that
understanding
is
the
fact
that
every
human
being
is
naturally
attuned
to
their
own
subjective
view
of
the
world
this
subjective
view
exists
in
order
to
promote
the
highest
good
of
the
individual
however
if
that
view
is
not
held
to
an
objective
standard
it
is
easy
for
the
individual
to
consider
not
what
is
morally
good
i
e
virtuous
but
rather
what
is
personally
good
i

type
of

one
thing
for

to

it
is
another
thing
entirely
to

“

so
long

”
this

can
only
be
uttered
by
one
who
is
grossly
ignorant
of

or
who
deliberately
lies
about
such

ignorance
is
certainly
no
excuse
for
committing
sin
because
every
catholic
has
the
duty
to
know
what
is
evil
and
what
is
not
and
further
they
should
know
why
certain
activities
are
evil
secular
courts
enforce
the
general
rule
that
“
ignorance

is
no
excuse
”
and
everyone
accepts
this
principle
why
should
it
be
any
different
for
the
eternal
law
a
person
is
culpable
for
the
evil
he
commits
when
he
“
takes

the

and
it
must
be
cared
for
by
forming

with
prayer
and
education
for
the
duration

the
catechism
states
“
the

is
indispensable
for
human
beings
who

a
dead
giveaway
that
a
person
s
conscience
is
improperly
formed
is
when
he
or
she
says
something
like
“
i
respect
the
teachings
of
the
church
but
i
follow
my
own
conscience
in
matters
of
sexual
morality
”
nancy
pelosi
gave
us
a
typical
example
of
this
deception
when
she
claimed
that
she
was
a
“
practicing
and
respectful
catholic
”
but
regarding
the
church
s
teachings
on
abortion
“
my
faith
isn
t
about
what
their
position
is
”
⁶
this
means
that
the
person
s
conscience
has
become
disconnected
from
the
truth
this

aware
of
the
intrinsically
evil
nature
of

other

and
is
led
by
this
knowledge
to
vigorously
oppose
them
failure
to
act
is
not
a
viable
option
it
is
true
that
catholics
must
follow
their
consciences
but
their
consciences
must
be
formed
by
the
word
of
god
which
is
authentically
interpreted
and
taught
by
the
magisterium
of
the
catholic
church
to
which
christ
entrusted
his
authority
to

the

must
be
continuously
schooled
to

the
catechism

instead
laid
out
very
clearly
the
multiple
dangers
inherent

line

wrote
“

little
for

furthermore
the
document
notes
that
“
not

can
be
found
who
seem
inclined
to
use
the
name
of
freedom
as
the
pretext
for
refusing
to
submit
to
authority
and
for
making
light
of
the
duty
of
obedience
”

the
document
continues
by
confirming
an
essential
principle
that
the
conscience
must
submit
itself
to
the
authority
of
the
church
in
forming
their
consciences
the
christian
faithful
must
give
careful
attention
to
the

certain

will
of

her
charge
is
to

at
the

however
the
conscience
must
work
with
the
teachings
of
the
church
never
against
it
 
conscientious
objection
the
church
as
demonstrated
in
a
particularly
vivid
manner
by
her
martyrs
has
always
held
that
a
person
s
properlyformed
conscience
may
never
be
violated
countless
men
women
and
even
children
have
courageously
stated
“
you
may
kill
me
but
you
will
never
force
me
to
violate
my
conscience
”
this
principle
has
more
recently
been
recognized
by
secular
authorities
the
united
nations
in
both
its
1948
universal
declaration
of
human
rights
and
its
1966
international
covenant
on
civil
and
political
rights
states
that
“
everyone
has
the
right
to
freedom
of
thought
conscience
and
religion
”
when
society
fails
to
acknowledge
conscience
as
a
human
right
and
does
not
provide
protections
for
individuals
to
follow
their
own
consciences
grave
conflicts
inevitably
result
either
people
will
heroically
obey
their
consciences
whatever
the
cost
or
they
will
lose
their
moral
integrity
with
all
the
devastating
effects
that
flow
from
this
on
society
at
large
there
are
thousands
of
incidents
on
record
where
conscientious
objectors
are
severely
punished
particularly
in
the
health
care
profession
many
have
been
fined
dismissed
from
their
jobs
and
even
in
some
cases
jailed
for
refusing
to
participate
in
such
intrinsic
evils
such
as
dispensing
contraceptives
and
abortifacients
and
refusing
to
participate
in
such
fundamental
violations
of
human
dignity
as
abortion
euthanasia
and
socalled
“
sexchanged
”
surgeries
 
conclusion
tragically
many
catholics
possess
a
fatally
flawed
concept
of
conscience
denying
the
need
for
formation
in
the
truth
and
treating
mere
desire
as
an
absolute
conscience
is
indeed
a
decisionmaker
but
it
must
be
freely
submitted
to
the
law
of
god
to
which
it
is
a
witness
not
an
arbiter
the
error
lies
not
in
affirming
the
freedom
of
conscience
to
decide
but
in
misinterpreting
the
nature
of
such
freedom
freedom
of
conscience
must
be
at
the
service
of
moral
truth
but
can
never
be
its
determinant

anticipated
this
kind
of
dishonesty
he
stated
in
a
footnote
to
the

gallagher
edition
of
the
council
texts
the
declaration
does
not
base
the
right
to
the
free
exercise
of
religion
on
“
freedom
of
conscience
”
nowhere
does
this
phrase
occur
and
the
declaration
nowhere
lends
its
authority
to
the
theory
for
which
the
phrase
frequently
stands
namely
that
i
have
the
right
to
do
what
my
conscience
tells
me
to
do
simply
because
my
conscience
tells
me
to
do
it
this
is
a
perilous
theory
its
particular
peril
is
subjectivism
―
the
notion
that
in
the
end
it
is
my
conscience
and
not
the
objective
truth
which
determines
what
is

examining

examining
the
role
of
conscience
in
making
moral
decisions
q
i
disagree
with
some
of
the
teachings
of
the
catholic
church
i
was
once
told
that
i
don
t
have
to
follow
all
of
the
church
s
teachings
if
they
violate
my
conscience
but
still
i
m
not
sure
that
s
right
a
first
i
want
to
commend
you
for
asking
this
question
the
fact
that
you
were
moved
to
ask
demonstrates
two
things
that
god
s
grace
can
be
operative
in
every
person
who
is
open
to
him
and
secondly
that
you
are
sincere
in
your
desire
to
do
god
s
will
i
have
run
into
a
number
of
people
in
a
similar
predicament
as
you
they
asked
someone
who
ought
to
be
able
to
give
some
guidance
on
what
was
a
difficult
moral
question
in
response
they
seemed
to
get
an
answer
that
indicated
that
in
the
end
they
had
to
just
“
follow
their
conscience
”
i
can
understand
this
in
the
course
of
my
life
as
a
priest
i
have
like
all
of
my
brother
priests
been
asked
to
weigh
in
on
life
situations
in
which
there
were
no
easy
or
obvious
answers
at
times
after
going
through
all
of
the
tools
and
resources
the
church
offers
for
right
decisionmaking
the
right
way
to
go
remained
foggy
and
difficult
“
when
he
listens
to
his
conscience
the
prudent
man
can
hear
god
speaking
”
—
ccc
1777
in
addition
the
catechism
of
the
catholic
church
teaches
“
when
he
listens
to
his
conscience
the
prudent
man
can
hear
god
speaking
”
ccc
1777
because
of
this
line
and
others
that
highlight
the
importance
of
conscience
it
is
tempting
to
take
the
default
position
of
“
whatever
you
feel
is
right
just
do
that
”
i
am
not
denying
this
after
all
this
is
clearly
part
of
the
catechism
i
m
not
about
to
go
toetotoe
with
the
catechism
and
think
that
i
can
win
i
m
not
that
smart
but
it
misses
crucial
pieces
of
information
first
while
it
is
essential
that
we
are
sincere
in
the
decisions
we
make
we
don
t
only
have
an
obligation
to
ourselves
this
is
something
that
we
have
lost
in
our
culture
we
think
that
“
to
thine
own
self
be
true
”
is
the
highest
commandment
it
isn
t
while
it
is
good
to
be
truthful
and
interiorly
at
peace
we
also
must
be
true
to
others
it
s
even
more
essential
that
we
are
true
to
god
we
may
have
an
obligation
to
strive
for
authenticity
but
we
also
have
an
obligation
to
obey
god
i
am
not
the
only
one
to
whom
i
must
be
true
second
the
church
s
teaching
on
conscience
presumes
knowledge
of
the
moral
law
this
means
that
those
who
are
exercising
conscience
know
that
there
is
a
real
right
and
a
real
wrong
unfortunately
there
are
fewer
people
who
acknowledge
this
reality
this
places
us
in
a
unique
place
in
human
history
we
may
have
an
obligation
to
strive
for
authenticity
but
we
also
have
an
obligation
to
obey
god
a
recent
study
reported
that
only
8
percent
of
american
teenagers
believe
in
a
real
right
and
a
real
wrong
this
ignorance
is
unprecedented
notre
dame
sociologist
christian
smith
recently
concluded
a
nationwide
study
on
the
moral
life
of
18
to
29yearolds
his
conclusion
was
that
this
age
group
generally
speaking
has
neither
the
vocabulary
nor
the
categories
to
make
moral
decisions
if
conscience
depends
on
principles
of
right
and
wrong
how
will
these
young
people
make
decisions
according
to
smith
they
base
their
decisions
on
feelings
but
conscience
is
not
a
feeling
the
catechism
clearly
states
that
conscience
“
formulates
its
judgments
according
to
reason
in
conformity
with
the
true
good
willed
by
the
wisdom
of
the
creator
”
ccc
1783
this
means
employing
one
s
mind
more
than
one
s
emotions
to
make
decisions
conscience
is
not
merely
some
feeling
we
get
it
is
the
critical
application
of
truth
to
the
present
issue
third
it
is
true
that
a
person
“
must
not
be
forced
to
act
contrary
to
his
conscience
nor
must
he
be
prevented
from
acting
according
to
his
conscience
especially
in
religious
matters
”
ccc
1782
but
this
does
not
mean
doing
whatever
pleases
me
let
s
take
a
potentially
explosive
issue
when
pope
paul
vi
reinforced
the
church
s
constant
teaching
against
artificial
birth
control
in
the
document
“
humanae
vitae
”
many
couples
were
encouraged
to
dismiss
this
teaching
if
it
“
violated
their
conscience
”
unfortunately
as
a
result
many
couples
were
obliquely
encouraged
to
invite
a
sinful
practice
into
their
sexual
relationship
even
more
they
were
led
to
believe
that
they
could
dismiss
virtually
any
official
and
binding
church
teaching
if
they
disliked
it
because
that
is
all
this
comes
down
to
the
church
s
teaching
on
contraception
does
not
“
violate
”
a
person
s
conscience
unless
a
person
truly
believed
that
periodic
abstinence
in
marriage
was
an
evil
which
is
all
that
is
being
asked
for
through
natural
family
planning
then
there
is
no
conscience
issue
here
it
is
an
issue
of
a
not
knowing
or
understanding
the
church
s
teaching
which
could
be
remedied
by
asking
someone
who
knows
b
lacking
the
will
to
choose
the
good
which
is
always
an
issue
for
every
person
striving
to
live
virtuously
but
not
a
good
reason
to
choose
sin
over
virtue
or
c
a
matter
of
personal
dislike
for
a
particular
teaching
or
the
church
in
general
seek
to
do
his
will
above
absolutely
all
else
even
in
very
difficult
circumstances
god
can
be
trusted
after
all
of
this
if
we
still
have
reasonable
doubt
regarding
what
to
do
we
ought
to
do
the
following
first
pray
second
it
is
wise
to

your

regularly
third

fourth

counsel

in

but
who
personally
defers
to

what
is
freedom
of
conscience
whether
they
re
happening
inside
the
church
or
out
in
the
public
square
debates
about
how
far
freedom
of
conscience
extends
can
be
confusing
should
christians
be
compelled
to
take
a
vaccine
that
s
been
tested
on
the
fetal
remains
of
an
aborted
child
should
christian
business
owners
have
a
right
to
refuse
a
service
that
would
violate
their
conscience
like
baking
a
wedding
cake
for
a
samesex
ceremony
how
do
christians
respond
to
government
mandates
or
policies
that
they
cannot
follow
in
good
conscience
and
how
do
we
deal
with
conscientious
disagreement
within
the
church
the
specifics
of
freedom
of
conscience
can
be
complex
and
nuanced
and
are
often
misunderstood
abraham
kuyper
called
the
conscience
“
the
shield
of
the
human
person
the
root
of
civil
liberties
the
source
of
a
nation
s
happiness
”
why
is
it
so
important
to
answer
that
question
let
s
begin
by
looking
at
what
the
conscience
is
and
is
not
what
is
“
conscience
”
definitions
of
conscience
vary
but
they
center
around
the
idea
of
what
someone
believes
to
be
right
and
wrong
the
conscience
is
a
moral
compass
that
helps
direct
people
s
actions
in
that
sense
conscience
is
personal
and
subjective
because
it
condemns
or
excuses
one
s
own
conduct
not
that
of
another
person
–
after
all
you
don
t
get
a
guilty
conscience
because
of
someone
else
s
behavior
however
conscience
is
also
based
on
an
objective
and
general
standard
the
bible
explains
that
the
conscience
is
given
by
god
to
both
christians
and
nonchristians
and
it
helps
people
apply
their
knowledge
of
right
and
wrong
to
their
behavior
both
past
actions
and
decisions
about
future
actions
the
new
testament
also
speaks
of
the
importance
of
having
a
good
conscience
by
following
its
direction
and
doing
what
is
right

christian
political
scientist
david
koyzis
in
his
book
we
answer
to
another
tells
a
story
about
the
milgram
experiment
which
relates
well
to
conscience
the
experiment
was
a
study
designed
to
look
at
how
people
respond
to
authority
the
experimenter
would
select
two
participants
and
assign
one
the
role
of
teacher
while
another
volunteer
would
be
given
the
role
of
student
the
person
selected
as
the
teacher
was
instructed
to
apply
an
electrical
shock
of
increasing
voltage
to
the
other
person
–
the
student
–
who
was
in
a
different
room
now
unbeknownst
to
the
teacher
the
other
person
was
actually
an
actor
being
paid
to
play
the
part
although
the
teacher
could
hear
the
apparent
pain
experienced
by
the
person
in
the
next
room
most
individuals
would
continue
applying
electric
shocks
–
despite
increasing
screams
and
pleas
to
stop
–
when
instructed
to
do
so
by
the
experimenter
however
two
participants
were
unwilling
to
keep
going
along
with
the
instructions
both
were
christians
they
followed
the
experiment
instructor
s
commands
for
a
time
but
stopped
sooner
than
most
other
participants
knowing
that
they
were
responsible
for
their
actions
and
stating
that
they
were
answerable
to
a
higher
authority
when
asked
to
do
something
wrong
we
too
are
responsible
for
our
actions
and
answerable
to
a
higher
authority
ultimately
the
foundation
for
freedom
of
conscience
is
found
in
the
sovereignty
of
god
every
human
being
has
various
authorities
in
their
lives
such
as
parents
employers
church
leadership
or
civil
government
each
of
these
has
legitimate
authority
over
us
but
that
authority
is
also
limited
the
only
one
who
is
sovereign
over
the
conscience
is
god
and
if
another
authority
commands
us
to
do
what
we
believe
is
sin
–
what
we
believe
violates
how
god
wants
us
to
act
–
then
we
can
appeal
to
freedom
of
conscience
the
conscience
is
a
shield
that
protects
against
the
abuse
of
authority
and
points
instead
to
the
one
higher
authority
conscience
and
the
public
square
debates
around
conscience
are
becoming
increasingly
relevant
in
our
society
and
are
most
noticeable
within
certain
vocations
can
medical
professionals
refuse
to
help
a
patient
access
abortion
assisted
suicide
or
sexchange
surgery
can
marriage
officiants
refuse
to
marry
a
samesex
couple
can
a
photographer
decline
a
request
to
take
photos
at
a
samesex
ceremony
can
a
publisher
decline
to
print
proabortion
pamphlets
increasingly
our
society
answers
“
no
”
to
allow
people
to
conscientiously
object
is
seen
as
simply
discriminatory
and
bigoted
our
society
needs
to
understand
that
a
conscientious
objection
in
these
cases
is
not
a
rejection
of
an
individual
person
but
a
refusal
to
commit
what
the
objector
believes
to
be
a
sin
or
to
participate
in
sinful
activity
today
it
s
often
christians
who
are
being
pressured
to
violate
their
conscience
however
there
are
others
who
seek
the
same
protections
for
their
conscience
it
s
this
freedom
that
an
atheist
doctor
appeals
to
when
he
determines
he
cannot
participate
in
euthanasia
based
on
his
oath
to
do
no
harm
and
what
of
the
fashion
designers
back
in
2016
who
had
principled
objections
to
designing
an
inauguration
dress
for
first
lady
melania
trump
when
these
designers
announced
they
would
not
make
the
dress
because
they
didn
t
want
to
be
associated
with
newly
elected
president
donald
trump
s
administration
many
celebrated
their
decision
as
taking
a
principled
stand
likewise
some
in
our
society
want
abortionsupporting
publishers
to
be
allowed
to
decline
print
orders
for
prolife
material
or
for
a
gay
business
owner
to
be
allowed
to
refuse
to
rent
a
hall
for
an
event
that
promotes
biblical
marriage
yet
increasingly
the
same
people
want
to
see
christians
reprimanded
for
acting
according
to
their
beliefs
for
christians
the
answer
to
the
questions
above
might
be
easy
but
we
have
our
own
disputes
about
conscience
within
the
church
as
well
such
as
what
kind
of
entertainment
is
permissible
or
what
it
looks
like
to
honor
the
sabbath
day
outside
of
corporate
worship
when
conscience
pricks
of
note
the
strongest
commands
of
conscience
are
often
negative
in
terms
of
what
you
are
not
permitted
to
do
rather
than
what
you
may
or
must
do
for
example
if
you
use
foul
language
your
conscience
will
likely
bother
you
more
than
if
you
fail
to
correct
someone
else
using
such
language
or
if
a
publisher
prints
proabortion
pamphlets
that
he
objects
to
his
conscience
will
make
him
feel
guilty
more
than
if
he
fails
to
promote
life
as
he
believes
he
ought
when
the
conscience
commands
a
person
not
to
do
something
the
command
is
about
a
very
specific
action
alternatively
if
the
command
is
instead
to
act
on
something
good
there
are
often
various
ways
of
pursuing
that
good
conscience
and
the
church
because
of
sin
no
person
s
conscience
is
perfectly
aligned
with
what
god
commands
in
his
word
the
chart
below
is
based
on
one
from
a
helpful
book
titled
conscience
what
it
is
how
to
train
it
and
loving
those
who
differ
by
andrew
naselli
and
j
d
crowley
the
authors
used
it
to
explain
the
difference
between
two
people
s
consciences
and
how
they
compare
to
god
s
will
the
letters
within
the
chart
refer
to
different
rules
or
principles
of
right
and
wrong
both
arnold
and
zoey
have
added
rules
to
their
conscience
that
are
not
commanded
in
scripture
for
example
perhaps
arnold
has
a
history
of
alcohol
abuse
in
his
family
so
he
adds
letter
c
which
commands
him
not
to
drink
alcohol
to
avoid
temptation
maybe
letters
d
and
e
are
arnold
s
belief
that
he
must
not
play
cards
or
any
games
involving
dice
arnold
and
zoey
have
also
both
failed
to
include
letter
b
in
their
conscience
perhaps
this
is
a
failure
to
consistently
honor
the
sabbath
day
and
their
consciences
no
longer
accuse
them
for
it
however
arnold
and
zoey
s
consciences
are
both
aligned
with
god
s
will
in
letters
j
through
m
where
they
have
rightly
applied
biblical
principles
and
commands
to
their
lives
and
consciences
the
natural
tendency
is
to
think
that
if
another
person
has
more
rules
than
us
they
are
legalistic
alternatively
if
they
have
fewer
rules
they
are
failing
to
live
as
christians
however
scripture
remains
the
standard
to
which
we
must
seek
to
align
our
conscience
the
conscience
can
easily
become
oversensitive
by
including
rules
that
are
not
matters
of
right
and
wrong
we
see
examples
of
the
pharisees
in
the
new
testament
who
created
additional
rules
for
the
sabbath
and
wanted
everyone
to
abide
by
them
we
might
feel
unnecessarily
guilty
if
we
do
not
abide
by
similar
rules
on
the
sabbath
alternatively
conscience
can
become
desensitized
perhaps
you
use
or
tolerate
foul
language
that
would
have
shocked
you
a
decade
ago
or
you
consume
entertainment
that
you
would
have
been
ashamed
of
years
earlier
our
conscience
does
not
always
accurately
tell
us
what
is
sin
and
what
is
not
while
it
might
not
always
make
sense
to
follow
conscience
in
relation
to
other
authorities
we
have
a
duty
to
obey
it
because
we
cannot
commit
what
we
believe
is
sin
at
the
same
time
we
should
be
careful
when
dealing
with
the
consciences
of
other
people
in
1
corinthians
8
the
apostle
paul
talks
about
whether
believers
can
eat
meat
offered
to
idols
and
refers
to
consideration
for
brothers
and
sisters
with
a
weaker
conscience
so
if
we
believe
a
brother
or
sister
has
a
weaker
conscience
we
must
not
be
a
stumbling
block
to
them
and
cause
them
to
disobey
their
conscience
on
disputable
issues
we
may
realize
that
someone
has
a
weaker
conscience
and
we
can
discuss
the
biblical
principles
that
apply
or
perhaps
they
have
a
stronger
conscience
and
they
can
help
us
understand
where
our
conscience
is
not
aligned
to
scripture
again
conscience
is
not
meant
to
be
some
wishywashy
idea
where
everyone
can
believe
what
they
want
like
in
the
time
of
the
judges
of
israel
when
“
everyone
did
what
was
right
in
his
own
eyes
”
there
are
direct
objective
commands
and
principles
that
can
be
taken
from
scripture
there
are
many
issues
which
should
not
be
disputable
for
christians
and
are
clear
in
the
bible
however
there
are
also
issues
where
serious
christians
can
come
to
different
conclusions
about
what
god
commands
for
example
what
activities
are
not
permitted
on
the
sabbath
or
perhaps
more
current
how
do
we
navigate
government
restrictions
and
the
call
to
honor
our
authorities
versus
our
callings
to
obey
what
god
demands
of
us
what
about
masking
vaccines
etc
both
within
the
public
square
and
the
church
christian
conscience
differs
on
these
issues
and
believers
can
have
biblical
arguments
for
why
they
think
god
commands
or
prohibits
different
actions
what
isn
t
conscience
some
of
us
might
react
to
the
idea
that
conscience
is
a
kind
of
subjective
belief
that
is
not
accountable
to
other
people
we
can
t
simply
say
“
well
what
s
right
for
you
isn
t
necessarily
right
for
me
”
conscience
is
not
merely
a
personal
preference
like
your
favorite
food
or
music
it
is
also
not
license
to
do
whatever
you
please
and
ignore
other
authorities
rather
freedom
of
conscience
refers
to
moral
beliefs
that
respect
a
limited
sphere
of
individual
authority
while
still
recognizing
other
legitimate
authorities
that
can
impose
obligations
on
us
as
such
the
conscience
is
not
unlimited
some
people
might
abuse
the
ability
to
claim
conscientious
objection
out
of
selfinterest
or
to
simply
justify
their
actions
authorities
such
as
the
civil
government
church
government
employers
or
parents
do
have
power
to
compel
or
deny
certain
actions
however
if
the
civil
government
or
other
authorities
limits
conscience
they
must
provide
good
justification
for
doing
so
and
seek
to
accommodate
conscientious
objectors
as
much
as
they
are
able
such
as
through
exemptions
for
freedom
of
conscience
abraham
kuyper
again
shows
the
importance
of
conscience
stating
that
“
ten
times
better
is
a
state
in
which
a
few
eccentrics
can
make
themselves
a
laughingstock
for
a
time
by
abusing
freedom
of
conscience
than
a
state
in
which
these
eccentricities
are
prevented
by
violating
conscience
itself
”
conclusion
ultimately
conscience
belongs
to
an
individual
and
is
accountable
to
god
however
it
should
also
be
rooted
in
biblical
commands
and
principles
increasingly
we
encounter
disagreements
in
the
church
about
various
issues
while
in
the
public
square
some
christians
jobs
are
threatened
because
the
state
fails
to
recognize
conscience
on
many
matters
christians
will
refuse
to
do
something
they
believe
is
evil
even
if
others
do
not
believe
the
action
is
wrong
the
church
has
an
opportunity
to
continue
to
show
our
society
what
it
means
to
live
according
to
moral
standards
based
on
the
will
and
sovereignty
of
god
wherever
we
find
ourselves
let
s
seek
to
say
“
i
myself
always
strive
to
have
a
conscience
without
offense
toward
god
and
men

human
rights
should
christians
be
free
to
obey
our
conscience
in
recent
years
there
s
been
a
worrying
downward
trend
for
religious
freedom
in
both
canada
and
the
united
states
examples
abound
of
christian
tshirt
printers
bakers
photographers
printshop
owners
wedding
dress
makers
florists
and
caterers
who
are
being
forced
–
through
human
rights
commissions
or
through
lawsuits
–
to
participate
in
samesex
weddings
in
violation
of
these
various
business
peoples
consciences
each
of
these
christian
business
people
said
they
would
bake
cater
arrange
flowers
print
invitations
take
photos
print
tshirts
etc
for
a
gay
person
s
birthday
or
retirement
party
or
any
other
celebration
–
they
just
wouldn
t
do
it
for
a
samesex
wedding
the
only
exception
was
the
wedding
dress
maker
for
obvious
reasons
this
means
the
objection
is
not
about
discriminating
against
gay
people
it
never
was
it
s
very
specifically
about
endorsing
a
definition
of
marriage
or
a
specific
act
that
fundamentally
violates
god
s
design
for
marriage
stand
up
for
others
i
know
of
christians
who
can
with
a
clean
conscience
bake
photograph
etc
a
gay
wedding
and
i
know
some
who
can
t
see

cor

this
is
a
legitimate
discussion
to
have
between
christians
the
much
bigger
question
is
should
the
state
force
the
latter
group
to
do
as
the
former
if
you
are
a
christian
and
you
advocate
that
the
state
is
justified
in
making
christians
participate
in
any
way
in
a
gay
marriage
i
believe
you
ve
ripped
the
rug
from
under
yourself
–
if
it
is
fine
for
the
state
to
violate
other
christians
consciences
this
time
what
s
to
prevent
them
from
violating
yours
next
if
a
christian
photographer
has
to
shoot
a
gay
wedding
does
a
church
have
to
rent
their
hall
for
a
gay
wedding
this
happened
in
british
columbia
in
2005
or
must
an
organist
play
for
a
gay
marriage
ceremony
or
will
a
christian
marriage
commissioner
be
forced
to
officiate
for
such
a
celebration
in
saskatchewan
and
manitoba
this
is
the
case
negative
implications
of
the
bill
for
christians
does
this
mean
that
i
m
ready
to
let
the
state
allow
the
same
kind
of
discrimination
against
christians
if
an
atheist
decides
he
doesn
t
want
to
take
photos
of
a
christian
wedding
am
i
okay
with
that
well
the
 
state
can
t
force
all
citizens
to
embrace
encourage
and
support
the
christian
faith
because
that
 
wouldn
t
be
freedom
of
religion
would
it
freedom
of
religion
is
freedom
from
the
state
and
not
from
fellow
citizens
your
charter
rights
protect
you
from
the
busybody
government
interfering

your
religious

they
are
not
meant
to
make
the
government
interfere
in
your
personal
or
professional
relationships
in
order
to
promote
oppose
or
defend
your
religion
so
to
be
clear
and
consistent
i
do
expect
and
accept
being
shunned
by
others
because
of
my
christian
beliefs
christ
predicted
it
didn
t
he
i
would
not
expect
the

to
go
to
bat
for
me
if
a

refused

nietzsche
means
the
idea
that
it
is
wrong
to
believe
something
unless
you
have
good
reason
to
think
that
the
belief
is
true
someone
with
an
intellectual
conscience
will
form
and
endorse
beliefs
by
applying
the
best
epistemic
standards
known
to
him
or
her
most
of
us
nietzsche
thinks
lack
an
intellectual
conscience
the
great
majority
of
people
lacks
an
intellectual
conscience
i
mean
the
great
majority
of
people
does
not
consider
it
contemptible
to
believe
this
or
that
and
to
live
accordingly
without
first
having
given
themselves
an
account
of
the
final
and
most
certain
reasons
pro
and
con
and
without
even
troubling
themselves
about
such
reasons

exercising
the
intellectual
conscience
if
one
does
possess
it
doesn
t
necessarily
lead
to
certainty
on
the
contrary
the
more
you
subject
your
beliefs
to
scrutiny
the
less
certain
you
will
become
about
them
this
is
good
because
searching
for
the
truth
as
well
as
finding
it
is
good
bernard
reginster
puts
the
point
as
follows
the
seeker
after
knowledge
must
want
both
knowledge
and
uncertainty
or
ignorance
he
cannot
be
a
genuine
seeker
after
truth
unless
he
actually
wants
to
find
it
but
since
what
he
cares
about
is
the
search
after
truth
he
must
also
welcome
the
uncertainty
and
ignorance
that
supply
opportunities
for
it
the
affirmation
of
life
nietzsche
on
overcoming
nihilism
although
intellectual
conscience
is
a
necessary
condition
it
is
not
nietzsche
seems
to
think
a
sufficient
one
the
“
last
idealists
of
knowledge
in
whom
alone
the
intellectual
conscience
dwells
today
”
namely
the
scientists
have
rendered
christian
belief
untenable
but
they
shrink
from
questioning
their
own
values
“
these
are
by
no
means
free
spirits
for
they
still
believe
in
the
value
of
truth
”

properly
employed
by
an
authentic
free
spirit
intellectual
conscience
works
against
the
tendency
to
assimilate
novel
experiences
or
problems
to
alreadyfamiliar
explanations
and
evaluations
by
eroding
convictions
and
multiplying
possibilities
it
counteracts
the
disposition
to
simplify
and
unify
and
makes
it
less

to
get
stuck

breaking
down
the
differences
close
how
does
the
conscious
differ
from
the
conscience
being
conscious
is
the
state
of
being
awake
and
alert
conscience
on
the
other
hand
refers
to
an
awareness
of
whether
actions
are
right
or
wrong
these
two
terms
are
sometimes
confused
in
common
everyday
usage
because
they
sound
quite
similar
however
as
you
can
see
they
mean
very
different
things
within
the
field
of
psychology
at
a
glance
while
the
two
terms
are
often
confused
the
conscious
and
the
conscience
refer
to
very
different
things
your
conscious
allows
you
to
be
aware
of
your
place
in
the
world
while
your
conscience
allows
you
to
behave
in
this
world
in
morally
and
socially
acceptable
ways
as
described
below
being
conscious
refers
to
your
awareness
of
yourself
and
the
world
around
you
your
conscience
is
your
ability
to
distinguish
between
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
what
does
conscience
mean
your
conscience
is
the
part
of
your
personality
that
helps
you
determine
right
and
wrong
and
keeps
you
from
acting
upon
your
most
basic
urges
and
desires
your
conscience
is
what
makes
you
feel
guilty
when
you
do
something
bad
and
good
when
you
do
something
kind
it
is
the
moral
basis
that
helps
guide
prosocial
behavior
or
behavior
that
helps
others
and
leads
you
to
behave
in
socially
acceptable
and
even
altruistic
ways
in
freudian
theory
the
conscience
is
part
of
the
superego
that
contains
information
about
what
is
viewed
as
bad
or
negative
by
your
parents
and
by
society
—
all
the
values
you
learned
and
absorbed
during
your
upbringing
the
conscience
emerges
over
time
as
you
take
in
information
about
what
is
considered
right
and
wrong
by
your
caregivers
your
peers
and
the
culture
in
which
you
live
one
way
a
child
s
sense
of
morality
might
develop
is
through
their
caregiver
s
rules
for
example
if
a
parent
sets
a
rule
a
child
could
learn
a
sense
of
right
and
wrong
regarding
that
topic
studies
have
also
examined
other
factors
that
may
affect
the
way
conscience
develops
including
the
nature
of
the
parentchild
relationship
style
of
parental
discipline
and
the
child
s
temperament
—
but
more
research
is
needed
what
does
conscious
mean
your
conscious
is
your
awareness
of
yourself
and
the
world
around
you
in
the
most
general
terms
it
means
being
awake
and
aware
some
experts
suggest
that
you
are
considered
conscious
of
something
if
you
are
able
to
put
it
into
words
not
only
can
you
be
conscious
—
as
in
awake
—
but
you
can
also
be
conscious
—
as
in
aware
—
of
your
thoughts
and
feelings
the
conscious
mind
in
psychology
the
conscious
mind
includes
everything
inside
your
awareness
including
fantasies
feelings
memories
perceptions
thoughts
a
metaphor
that
is
sometimes
used
to
explain
the
concept
of
the
conscious
mind
within
psychoanalytic
theory
is
likening
the
mind
to
an
iceberg
the
part
of
the
iceberg
that
can
be
seen
above
the
surface
of
the
water
represents
conscious
awareness
it
is
what
we
are
aware
of
and
can
describe
and
articulate
clearly
the
largest
part
of
the
iceberg
actually
lies
below
the
surface
of
the
water
this
represents
the
unconscious
mind
and
includes
all
the
thoughts
memories
and
urges
that
are
outside
of
our
conscious
awareness
this
metaphor
is
frequently
attributed
to
sigmund
freud
but
according
to
the
american
psychological
association
apa
he
never
wrote
about
it
what
is
consciousness
your
consciousness
refers
to
your
conscious
experiences
your
individual
awareness
of
your
own
internal
thoughts
feelings
memories
and
sensations
consciousness
is
often
thought
of
as
a
stream
constantly
shifting
according
to
the
ebb
and
flow
of
your
thoughts
and
experiences
of
the
world
around
you
consciousness
is
generally
defined
as
awareness
of
your
thoughts
actions
feelings
sensations
perceptions
and
other
mental
processes
explain
psychologists
douglass
a
bernstein
louis
a
penner
and
edward
roy
in
other
words
they
say
this
suggests
that
consciousness
isn
t
just
one
mental
process
but
rather
a
part
of
many
for
example
memories
can
be
conscious
but
consciousness
is
not
just
memory
perceptions
can
be
conscious
but
consciousness
is
not
just
perception
the
conscious
and
consciousness
can
be
difficult
to
pin
down
as
psychologist
and
philosopher
william
james
once
explained
its
meaning
we
know
so
long
as
no
one
asks
us
to
define
it
consciousness
in
psychology
breaking

conscious
adjective
mental
awareness
means
a
person
is
awake
and
responsive
to
further
explain
their
differences
here
are
examples
of
how
the
terms
conscience
and
conscious
could
be
used
in
a
sentence
conscience
they
had
a
guilty
conscience

they
cheated
on

the
term
conscience
here
describes
this
person
s
sense
of
what
is
right
and
wrong
and
the
subsequent
feeling
of
guilt
they
have
over
cheating
on

test

they
were
worried
they
might
faint
at
the
sight

they

would

refers

conscience

indicates
that

it
s
definitely
easy
to
confuse
the

particularly
when

however
with
the

you
should

friedrich
wilhelm
nietzsche
german
philosopher
philologist
in
his
genealogy
of
morals
nietzsche
dives
into
the
origin
of
morals
starting
with
two
forms
of
morality
in
the
first
essay
the
master
morality
and
the
slave
morality
in
order
to
understand
the
subject
of
this
essay
that
discusses
the
origin
of
guilt
and
bad
conscience
it
is
vital
to
briefly
demonstrate
the
first
essay
because
the
second
essay
is
followed
by
the
latter
in
the
first
essay
of
the
genealogy
of
morals
nietzsche
demonstrates
the
origin
of
good
and
evil
and
that
there
are
two
opposing
moralities
nietzsche
names
them
the
master
morality
and
the
slave
morality
the
master
morality
is
associated
with
strength
confidence
wealth
and
power
whereas
the
slave
morality
is
associated
with
weak
powerless
poor
and
ugly
nietzsche
argues
that
master
morality
does
not
hold
grudges
or
deterred
by
the
actions
of
others
—
it
holds
its
position
and
is
focused
on
doing
the
things
that
it
wants
and
always
believes
in
the
possibility
of
things
on
the
contrary
the
slave
morality
is
weak
and
therefore
it
holds
grudges
against
the
strong
the
slave
morality
thinks
that
not
everything
is
possible
because
the
strong
always
win
the
slave
morality
therefore
becomes
jealous
vengeful
and
seeks
revenge
from
the
strong
powered
by
ressentiment
“
all
noble
morality
grows
out
of
a
triumphant
saying
yes
to
itself
slave
morality
says
no
on
principle
to
everything
that
is
outside
other
nonself
and
this
no
is
its
creative
deed
this
reversal
of
the
evaluating
glance
—
this
inevitable
orientation
to
the
outside
instead
of
back
onto
itself
—
is
a
feature
of
ressentiment
”
the
nietzsche
reader
on
the
genealogy
of
morality
a
polemic
p400
in
the
second
essay
of
the
genealogy
of
morals
nietzsche
argues
that
humans
and
their
nature
are
different
from
the
rest
of
the
animals
it
is
because
of
the
ability
to
make
promises
that
makes
a
human
different
superior
and
organised
from
other
species
on
earth
the
ability
to
remember
the
promises
made
at
a
certain
point
under
a
specific
condition
ought
to
be
delivered
at
a
particular
time
in
future
this
promise
has
different
connotations
within
an
individual
a
society
and
a
global
realm
the
individual
realm
is
concerned
with
direct
interaction
between
two
individuals
society
and
the
world
in
itself
it
is
because
the
individual
makes
a
promise
at
different
levels
for
instance
it
promises
another
individual
to
do
a
thing
at
a
specific
time
in
the
future
whilst
the
individual
also
makes
a
promise
to
a
society
that
creates
a
relationship
between
the
two
as
rousseau
calls
it
social
contract
in
society
an
individual
makes
a
promise
not
to
break
the
law
this
promise
in
itself
is
a
social
contract
according
to
rousseau
moreover
according
to
nietzsche
breaking
a
promise
is
thus
the
origin
of
guilt
where
the
promisebreaker
forgets
to
uphold
the
promise
that
heshe
made
“
like
a
doorkeeper
or
guardian
of
mental
order
rest
and
etiquette
from
which
we
can
immediately
see
how
there
could
be
no
happiness
cheerfulness
hope
pride
immediacy
without
forgetfulness
”
the
nietzsche
reader
on
the
genealogy
of
morality
a
polemic
p408
however
this
forgetfulness
can
happen
in
two
ways
one
which
the
promisebreaker
truly
forgets
and
the
second
in
which
the
promisebreaker
breaks
hisher
promise
intentionally
not
because
of
forgetting
it
but
forgetting
it
intentionally
the
other
end
to
forgetfulness
is
the
sense
of
ignorance
which
leads
to
more
happiness
as
the
consciousness
of
the
human
forgot
or
yet
to
learn
about
the
things
that
cause
unhappiness
as
they
say
the
wiser
the
human
becomes
the
less
happy
heshe
is
one
of
the
reasons
behind
humans
as
a
superior
species
is
their
free
will
and
the
sovereign
soul
that
makes
decisions
based
on
hisher
choice
hence
nietzsche
argues
that
“
this
sovereign
—
how
could
he
remain
ignorant
of
his
superiority
over
everybody
else
who
is
not
permitted
to
make
a
promise
or
answer
for
himself
how
much
trust
fear
and
respect
he
arouses
—
he
merits
all
three
”
the
nietzsche
reader
on
the
genealogy
of
morality
a
polemic
p409
the
point
in
which
a
person
makes
a
promise
is
not
only
to
another
person
but
he
should
also
answer
for
himself
for
instance
i
will
do
this
or
that
the
terminology
of
i
will
means
that
i
promise
refers
to
an
action
of
the
future
however
a
human
breaks
too
many
promises
of
himself
but
breaking
a
promise
for
another
person
will
lead
to
a
severe
sense
of
guilt
the
human
s
consciousness
will
push
through
to
uphold
the
promise
“
what
will
he
call
his
dominant
instinct
assuming
that
he
needs
a
word
for
it
no
doubt
about
the
answer
this
sovereign
man
calls
it
his
conscience
”
the
nietzsche
reader
on
the
genealogy
of
morality
a
polemic
p409
nietzsche
describes
the
parties
involved
in
the
promise
as
the
creditor
and
debtor
where
the
debtor
repays
the
creditor
in
the
form
of
punishment
in
which
pain
could
be
extracted
the
exchange
in
which
pain
as
a
form
of
debt
is
extracted
from
the
debtor
pays
the
creditor
according
to
nietzsche
is
pleasurable
however
nietzsche
makes
another
argument
that
concerns
memory
and
has
to
do
with
the
idea
of
forgetfulness
“
only
something
which
continues
to
hurt
stays
in
the
memory
—
that
is
a
proposition
from
the
oldest
and
unfortunately
the
longestlived
psychology
on
earth
”
the
nietzsche
reader
on
the
genealogy
of
morality
a
polemic
p410
often
in
punishing
individuals
the
psychology
behind
it
is
that
it
will
stay
in
the
memory
of
both
the
observer
and
the
subject
—
it
shall
prevent
the
individual
from
committing
a
crime
but
also
give
a
lesson
for
the
rest
of
society
that
they
will
be
punished
for
their
involvement
in
the
act
of
crime
however
this
is
not
what
nietzsche
wants
to
bring
into
the
modern
world
rather
he
dives
into
the
genealogy
of
justice
and
morality
practised
in
ancient
times
through
the
relationship
of
creditor
and
debtor
thus
the
debtor
is
the
person
who
holds
guilt
or
is
guilty
of
breaking
the
law
or
promise
the
debtor
should
repay
the
creditor
in
the
form
that
substitutes
the
debtor
s
benefits
it
can
be
extended
to
different
realms
of
society
for
instance
the
creditor
can
be
a
religious
king
or
a
rich
person
and
debtor
based
on
the
contract
heshe
has
must
repay
for
what
substitutes
for
the
sin
heshe
has
committed
this
can
be
money
food
freedom
or
the
debtor
s
body
something
the
debtor
owns
that
when
the
debtor
is
unable
to
pay
the
creditor
the
things
that
the
debtor
owns
will
substitute
instead
as
a
form
of
payment
however
nietzsche
argues
in
case
when
the
debtor
puts
his
body
as
a
substitute
“
in
particular
the
creditor
could
inflict
all
kinds
of
dishonour
and
torture
on
the
body
of
the
debtor
for
example
cutting
as
much
flesh
off
as
seemed
appropriate
for
the
debt
”
the
nietzsche
reader
on
the
genealogy
of
morality
a
polemic
p412
this
could
result
in
the
death
of
the
debtor
furthermore
the
relationship
between
creditor
and
debtor
is
the
primary
but
profound
legal
form
to
keep
the
order
within
a
community
thus
it
evolved
over
time
and
changed
to
a
system
of
justice
in
which
criminals
are
punished
for
the
act
that
harmed
the
creditor
this
act
could
harm
the
creditor
and
the
community
the
debtor
belongs
to
as
a
whole
therefore
the
punishment
is
necessary
to
prevent
such
acts
in
the
future
from
other
community
members
in
contrast
nietzsche
argues
that
“
it
was
out
of
anger
over
some
wrong
which
had
been
suffered
directed
at
the
perpetrator
—
but
this
anger
was
held
in
check
and
modified
by
the
idea
that
every
injury
has
its
equivalent
which
can
be
paid
in
compensation
if
only
through
the
pain
of
the
person
who
injures
”
the
nietzsche
reader
on
the
genealogy
of
morality
a
polemic
p412
the
punishment
will
not
prevent
future
wrong
acts
but
it
expresses
that
every
wrong
act
has
a
price
and
in
a
system
of
justice
whether
ancient
or
modern
—
the
price
is
measured
according
to
the
time
age
duration
and
consequences
of
the
wrong
act
of
the
doer
the
punishment
marks
in
the
debtor
s
memory
and
through
pain
the
memory
lasts
for
quite
a
long
time
however
the
memory
of
the
pain
may
vanish
or
be
forgotten
at
a
certain
point
in
future
but
the
other
aspect
that
nietzsche
touched
upon
briefly
is
the
humiliation
of
the
debtor
by
the
creditor
the
psychology
of
humiliation
extends
it
will
make
the
debtor
disappear
from
the
public
eyes
after
receiving
the
punishment
in
the
public
arena
for
example
the
extrajudicial
beating
denigrating
and
shaving
the
heads
of
thieves
in
public
spaces
by
the
taliban
in
afghanistan
as
seen
in
the
21st
century
where
they
not
only
punish
them
but
parade
the
criminals
on
the
streets
these
criminals
however
receive
physical
punishment
but
the
humiliation
in
the
public
spaces
will
have
exponential
psychological
consequences
both
for
the
public
observers
and
the
criminals
at
the
same
time
the
debtor
s
price
in
a
developing
country
is
higher
than
in
a
rich
country
today
the
punishment
of
the
debtor
is
crueler
in
poorer
communities
around
the
world
however
it
is
profoundly
connected
with
the
amount
of
pleasure
the
creditor
receives
from
the
punishment
of
the
debtor
because
some
of
the
rich
countries
too
participate
in
getting
pleasure
from
inflicting
pain
on
the
debtor
“
to
make
someone
suffer
—
a
true
feast
something
which
as
i
mentioned
rose
in
price
the
more
it
contrasted
with
the
rank
and
social
position
of
the
creditor
”
the
nietzsche
reader
on

genealogy
of
morality
a
polemic

because
the
creditor
feels
threatened
for
his
position
he
will
hold
the
law
in
his
hand
to
extract
as
much
pain
from
the
debtor
as
his
societal
position
allows
him
to
this
extraction
of
pain
is
pleasurable
for
the
creditor
it
is
not
a
direct
pleasure
but
a
pleasure
of
superiority
a
pleasure
in
which
the
creditor
feels
powerful
strong
and
in
a
position
of
authority
“
through
punishment
of
the
debtor
the
creditor
takes
part
in
the
rights
of
the
masters
at
last
he
too
shares
the
elevated
feeling
of
despising
and
maltreating
someone
as
an
inferior
”
the
nietzsche
reader
on
the
genealogy
of
morality
a
polemic
p413
this
also
becomes
problematic
as
the
creditor
extends
his
credits
to
those
who
will
most
probably
be
unable
to
repay
the
debts
and
it
is
therefore
the
creditor
will
enjoy
not
the
pleasure
of
punishing
the
debtor
but
enjoy
having
authority
and
power
moreover
the
extension
of
the
credits
in
which
those
who
are
unable
to
repay
it
will
enable
the
creditors
to
enjoy
an
authority
position
thus
the
notion
of
will
to
power
expands
to
a
deeper
discussion
for
another
essay
furthermore
the
relationship
between
creditor
and
debtor
has
another
crucial
element
and
it
deals
with
justice
which
is
only
implemented
by
the
strong
or
the
creditor
justice
is
a
term
linked
with
strength
power
and
authority
what
is
just
and
what
is
not
can
only
be
determined
by
the
strong
—
only
the
strong
dictates
justice
“
justice
at
this
first
level
is
the
goodwill
between
those
who
are
roughly
equal
to
come
to
terms
with
each
other
”
the
nietzsche
reader
on
the
genealogy
of
morality
a
polemic
p414
nietzsche
further
takes
the
discussion
of
justice
to
a
system
that
emerges
in
greater
human
civilisation
with
greater
populations
a
system
of
justice
is
called
the
court
where
before
anything
ruling
on
the
punishment
of
the
debtor
the
court
is
the
place
where
the
debtor
is
found
guilty
of
not
repaying
the
creditor
or
the
creditor
who
is
strong
enough
can
show
mercy
and
forgives
the
debtor
“
as
a
community
grows
in
power
it
ceases
to
take
the
offence
of
the
individual
quite
so
seriously
because
these
do
not
seem
to
be
as
dangerous
and
destabilising
for
the
survival
of
the
whole
as
they
did
earlier
the
wrongdoer
is
no
longer
deprived
of
peace
and
cast
out
nor
can
the
general
public
vent
their
anger
on
him
with
the
same
lack
of
constraint
—
instead
the
wrongdoer
is
carefully
shielded
by
the
community
from
this
anger
especially
from
that
of
the
immediate
injured
party
and
given
protection
”
the
nietzsche
reader
on
the
genealogy
of
morality
a
polemic
p415
in
another
part
nietzsche
argues
that
“
the
creditor
always
becomes
more
humane
as
his
wealth
increases
”
the
nietzsche
reader
on
the
genealogy
of
morality
a
polemic
p416
with
the
increase
of
wealth
the
creditor
realises
that
the
time
spent
on
the
punishment
of
the
weak
or
the
debtor
is
merely
a
waste
of
time
—
a
time
so
precious
that
it
may
bring
more
wealth
thus
the
creditor
often
suffices
with
minimum
punishment
without
the
intention
of
pleasure
or
a
sense
of
mastery
but
to
keep
the
debtor
in
check
for
instance
the
death
penalty
does
exist
in
most
authoritarian
regimes
the
execution
of
the
political
opposition
that
damages
the
regime
—
making
it
an
excuse
to
execute
any
political
opposition
on
the
other
hand
many
other
countries
give
the
death
penalty
only
to
sporadic
and
exceptional
cases
as
a
form
of
justice
for
the
victim
and
justice
for
the
perpetrator
s
guilt
however
there
are
other
exceptional
cases
in
which
the
victim
forgives
the
debtor
and
reduces
the
amount
of
suffering
that
debtor
may
face
one
can
also
argue
that
punishment
will
undo
the
wrong
act
committed
by
the
debtor
“
the
selfsublimation
of
justice
we
know
what
a
nice
name
it
gives
itself
—
mercy
it
remains
of
course
the
prerogative
of
the
most
powerful
man
better
still
his
way
of
being
beyond
the
law
”
the
nietzsche
reader
on
the
genealogy
of
morality
a
polemic
p416
on
the
contrary
most
people
may
be
confused
with
the
forms
of
justice
being
applied
in
different
realms
of
society
as
discussed
in
the
first
essay
of
the
genealogy
of
morals
by
nietzsche
that
the
revolt
of
the
slave
morality
against
the
strong
is
out
of
resentment
and
jealousy
the
slave
morality
is
vengeful
yet
it
is
not
strong
physically
therefore
the
slave
morality
uses
religion
as
a
weapon
of
fear
to
control
and
take
revenge
from
the
strong
this
will
to
power
of
the
slave
morality
is
out
of
resentment
and
envy
hence
when
the
slave
morality
is
in
power
its
justice
is
reactionary
justice
must
not
come
from
a
resentful
person
it
is
not
justice
in
any
form
or
shape
but
revenge
the
law
order
and
justice
are
only
applied
to
the
reactionary
people
not
the
active
and
strong
if
the
revenge
of
the
reactionary
takes
the
shape
of
justice
it
is
without
a
doubt
that
it
breeds
more
reactionary
people
who
will
seek
revenge
for
the
cruelty
they
face
and
call
it
justice
in
conclusion
this
essay
is
demonstrated
in
the
second
essay
of
the
genealogy
of
morals
by
nietzsche
in
which
he
argues
that
making
a
promise
is
a
skill
that
only
humans
possess
this
ability
to
remember
what
is
owed
and
when
it
is
due
the
relationship
that
nietzsche
talks
about
is
between
creditor
and
debtor
thus
when
the
debtor
breaks
his
promise
this
broken
promise
is
the
origin
of
guilt
for
nietzsche
and
in
the
process
the
debtor
before
making
a
promise
must
substitute
something
in
the
case
if
he
is
unable
to
repay
the
debts
to
the
creditor
in
any
form
—
which
lead
us
to
the
notion
of
justice
and
how
justice
can
prevail
between
the
creditor
and
debtor
after
all
nietzsche
s
interest
in
the
profundity
of
the
elements
of
justice
guilt
or
bad
conscience
describes
how
the
justice
system
worked
both
historically
and
psychologically
for
nietzsche
it
is
not
only
important
to
think
about
the
origin
of
the
abovediscussed
subjects
but
also
their
correlation
to
the
modern
world
—
the
two
opposing
poles
that
nietzsche
elaborates
on
in
his
philosophy

the
question
of
what
role
the
human
mind
plays
in
moral
behaviour
—
or
the
study
of
moral
psychology
—
has
been
a
fruitful
area
of
research
in
medieval
philosophy
since
at
least
the
early
to
mid1990s
since
then
scholars
have
done
much
to
illuminate
medieval
contributions
to
such
perennial
topics
as
the
freedom
of
the
will
the
problem
of
moral
weakness
and
what
role
if
any
the
emotions
and
the
moral
virtues
play
in
the

happiness

however
has
been
devoted
to
what
was

to

metaethical
the
mental
habit

what
is
the
scope
and
nature
of
this
apparent
ability
to
intuitively
grasp
right
from
wrong
can
conscience
err
and
if
so
do
its
dictates
still
bind
the
best
way
to
address
these
and
other
questions
is
to
employ
a
developmental
approach
the
term
conscience
is
still
generally
used
to
refer
to
an
innate
moral
sense
but
it
has
slightly
different
connotations
today
than
it
did
in
the
medieval
period
which
in
turn
had
different
connotations
from
what
preceded
it
in
pagan
antiquity
and
in
scripture
still
medieval
theories
of
conscience
drew
extensively
on
these
earlier
sources
since
the
concepts
of
conscience
and
synderesis
evolved
over
time
then
it
will
be
necessary
to
take
a
linear
approach

the

the

judicial
conscience
to
understand
the
medieval
theory
of
conscience
it
is
essential
to
examine
its
etymology
unlike
most
philosophical
categories
that
are
central
to
medieval
thought
the
concept
of
conscience
did
not
have
its
origins
in
plato
or
aristotle

rather
most
scholars
agree
it
originated
in
the
greek
playwrights
of
the
fifth
century

it
is
also
possible
to
find
its
use
elsewhere
in
greek
literature
such
as
in
the
fragments
of

the
english
word
“
conscience
”
is
derived
from
the
latin
conscientia
its
greek
equivalent
is
syneidesis
both
terms
connote
a
state
or
act
of
“
sharing
knowledge
with
oneself
”
sorabji

this
knowledge
is
privileged
and
involves
awareness
of
a
personal
moral
defect
the
notion
that
“
i
”
can
judge
“
myself
”
naturally
suggests
as
sorabji
puts
it
a
sort
of
“
split
personality
”
that
is
it
suggests
that
i
can
at
once
be
both
the
judge
and
the
one
being
judged
particularly
with
respect
to
specific
past
actions
which
ordinarily
elicit
remorse
this
suggestion
is
rooted
in
the
quite
intuitive
idea
that
human
beings
are
reflexive
animals
beings
who
are
not
only
capable
of
turning
their
attention
to
objects
in
the
outside
world
but
can
also
“
turn
back
on
”
reflectere
or
become
an
object
to
themselves
as
c
s
lewis
put
it
in
his
study
of
the
concept
of
concept
of
conscience
in
the
western
tradition
man
might
be
defined
as
a
reflexive
animal
a
person
cannot
help
thinking
and
speaking
of
himself
as
and
even
feeling
himself
to
be
for
certain
purposes
two
people
one
of
whom
can
act
upon
and
observe
the
other
thus
he
pities

admires
hates
despises
rebukes
comforts
examines
masters
or
is
mastered
by
“
himself
”
he
is
privy
to
his
own
acts
is
his
own
conscius
or
accomplice
and
of
course
this
shadowy
inner
accomplice
has
all
the
same
properties
as
an
external
one
he
too
is
a
witness
against
you
a
potential
blackmailer
one
who
inflicts
shame
and
fear

lewis
refers
to
this
primarily
pagan
understanding
of
conscience
as
an
“
inner
witness
”
it
does
not
judge
our
actions
as
right
or
wrong
but
merely
testifies
to
their
existence
it
bears
witness
to
the
facts
say
that
we
committed
a
murder
it
does
not
tell
us
that
murder
is
wrong
we
are
supposed
to
know
that
in
some
other
way
lewis

others
however
regard
the
sort
of
conscience
that
lewis
describes
here
as
a
type
of
internal
judge
and
therefore
refer
to
it
as
“
judicial
conscience
”

while
this
property
of
the
mind
does
not
necessarily
issue
binding
rules
it
does
pass
moral
judgements
on
our
deeds
it
would
however
eventually
take
on
the
role
of
issuing
moral
dictates
for
future
acts
as
well
eric
d
arcy
refers
to
this
later
form
of
syneidesis
or
conscientia
as
the
“
legislative
conscience
”
whose
innovator
he
argues
was
the
apostle
paul

st
paul
legislative
conscience
the
judicial
understanding
of
conscience
continued
well
into
the
first
century
of
the
common
era
to
be
sure
paul
himself
continued
to
employ
it
at
the
same
time
d
arcy
credited
paul
with
introducing
in
addition
to
the
“
judicial
conscience
”
a
novel
conception
he
termed
the
“
legislative
conscience
”
it
is
not
difficult
to
see
why
the
earlier
judicial
conception
would
later
take
on
legislative
features
this
is
because
the
ability
to
judge
past
actions
as
either
right
or
wrong
—
and
to
issue
exhortations
on
that
basis
—
would
once
this
property
came
to
be
associated
with
the
moral
law
take
on
the
legislative
role
of
issuing
commands
indeed
it
is
in
st
paul
that
we
find
this
very
association
between
syneidesis
and
the
moral
law
when
gentiles
who
do
not
have
the
law
do
by
nature
things
required
by
the
law
they
are
a
law
for
themselves
even
though
they
do
not
have
the
law
they
show
that
the
requirements
of
the
law
are
written
on
their
hearts
their
consciences
also
bearing
witness
and
their
thoughts
sometimes
accusing
them
and
at
other
times
even
defending
them

niv
judging
by
this
passage
there
are
evidently
two
expressions
of
the
moral
law
according
to
paul
the
mosaic
law
explicitly
handed
down
to
the
jews
and
another
law
that
is
“
written
on
men
s
hearts
”
this
latter
was
later
glossed
as
a
reference
to
the
natural
law
which
is
accessible
to
all
people
nonjews
included
and
is
consistent
with
the
mosaic
law
notice
that
according
to
the
foregoing
passage
conscience
syneidesis
is
not
the
ultimate
source
of
right
and
wrong
rather
the
foundation
of
right
and
wrong
is
the
objective
moral
law
which
is
both
“
written
on
men
s
hearts
”
and
borne
witness
to
by
conscience
one
might
say
then
that
the
objective
norm
of
morality
on
paul
s
account
is
the
moral
law
or
natural
law
conscience
however
might
be
termed
morality
s
subjective
norm
this
is
made
clear
in
another
passage
from
st
paul
where
he
is
addressing
the
question
of
whether
it
is
permissible
for
christians
to
eat
meat
that
was
previously
sacrificed
to
idols
some
paul
says
erroneously
think
that
to
eat
such
food
defiles
them
in
fact
since
the
pagan
idols
do
not
exist
eating
food
sacrificed
to
them
or
indeed
to
god
himself
is
morally
irrelevant
since
“
food
does
not
bring
us
near
to
god
—
we
are
no
worse

up

introduces
an
entirely
new
phase
in
the
history
of
the

in

theory

two
new
features
characterize
his
use
of
it

it
is
to
play
a
directive
role
before
action
takes
place
in
the
pagan
writers
conscience
did
not
appear
on
the
scene
until
after
the
action
was
performed
and
its
role
was
purely
judicial
but
in
st
paul
conscience
is
credited
with
a
legislative
function
and
it
induces
an
obligation
in
the
proper
sense

is

the
directions
it
issues
may

we

this
phase
in
the
development
of
the
concept
of
conscience
—
that
is
from
its
origins
in
fifthcentury
bce
greek
literature

—
has
eight
features

1
it
involves
a
consciousness
of
the
self
rather
than
of
others
2
it
draws
on
values
to
which
one
feels
personally
committed
or
that
are
“
not
necessarily
shared
by
others
”
3
it
is
selfreflexive
insofar
as
it
suggests
a
“
split
person
”
an
“
i
”
that
has
secret
knowledge
which
it
shares
with
itself
4
its
original
purpose
was
“
retrospective
”
or
judicial
although
it
later
incorporated
into
its
definition
a
“
prospective
”
or
legislative
function
5
although
it
draws
on
general
moral
principles
it
is
chiefly
concerned
with
their
application
to
the
specific
circumstances
in
which
the
agent
finds
him
or
herself
6
it
began
as
a
secular
concept
7
in
the
christian
tradition
it
is
regarded
as
susceptible
to
error
and
8
although
cognitive
in
character
it
possesses
motivating
or
affective
power

st
jerome
the
invention
of
synderesis
that
conscience
was
so
central
a
concept
in
st
paul
s
writings
guaranteed
it
an
important
place
in
the
moral
theology
of
the
greek
and
latin
fathers
especially
st
basil
john
damascene
and
st
ambrose
amongst
these
early
writers
however
it
was
a
text
from
st
jerome
that
was
particularly
consequential
since
it
introduced
into
the
debate
a
neologism
that
would
have
an
important
impact
in
the
later
middle
ages
the
concept
of
synderesis
in
the
course
of
commenting
on
ezekiel
jerome
had
tied
a
prophecy
mentioned
in
its
first
book
to
plato
s
moral
psychology
commentary
on
ezekiel

the
prophecy
in
question
consisted
of
a
vision
of
four
creatures
emerging
from
the
heavens
each
with
four
faces
those
of
a
man
a
lion
an
ox
and
an
eagle
ezekiel

in
his
gloss
jerome
noted
that
“
most
people
”

interpreted
this
vision
with
reference
to
plato
s
tripartite
division
of
the
soul

the

face
the
spirited
part
and
the
ox
s
face

appetitive
part
cf
plato

436b
–

what
did
the
eagle
represent
according
to
jerome
it
represented
that
“
spark
of
conscience
”
scintilla
conscientiae
which
makes
us
aware
of
our
sinfulness
when
reason
spirit
or
desire
become
disordered
medieval
manuscripts
refer
to
this
psychological
property
as
synderesis
or
sometimes
synteresis
now
above
these
three
was
the
eagle
so
in
the
soul
they
say
above
the
other
three
elements
and
beyond
them
is
a
fourth
which
the
greeks
call
synderesis
this
is
that
spark
of
conscience
which
was
not
quenched
even
in
the
heart
of
cain
when
he
was
driven
out
of
paradise
this
it
is
that
which
makes
us
too
feel
our
sinfulness
when
we
are
overcome
by
evil
desire
or
unbridled
spirit
or
deceived
by
sham
reason
it
is
natural
to
identify
synderesis
with
the
eagle
since
it
is
distinct
from
the
other
three
elements
and
corrects
them
when
they
err
however
we
also
see
that
this
conscience
conscientia
is
cast
down
in
some
people
who
have
neither
shame
nor
insight
regarding
their
offences
and
loses
its
place

most
scholars
now
agree
that
the
neologism
“
synderesis
”
introduced
in
jerome
s
commentary
is
simply
a
corruption
of
the
greek
syneidesis
kries
2002
67
since
syneidesis
is
simply
the
greek
equivalent
of
the
latin
term
conscientia
—
a
fact
of
which
jerome
would
certainly
have
been
aware
—
one
might
have
expected
jerome
to
use
them
interchangeably
surprisingly
however
jerome
suggests
that
the
latin
term
means
something
different
from
the
greek
term
in
the
text
cited
above
he
quite
explicitly
states
that
regardless
of
how
morally
corrupt
its
possessor
becomes
synderesis
can
never
be
lost
a
few
lines
later
however
he
does
admit
the
existence
of
those
who
are
shameless
and
lacking
in
moral
insight
such
people
are
oblivious
to
their
offenses
because
according
to
jerome
their
conscience
conscientia
ceases
to
be
present
in
them
“
looses
its
place
”
if
synderesis
cannot
be
lost
but
conscience
can
then
it
seems
to
follow
that
they
are
separate
properties
of
the
soul
in
any
case
whatever
jerome

intention
this
curious
passage

the

peter

of
the
concept
of

is
both
surprising
and
unsurprising
it
is
—
at
first
sight
anyway
—
surprising
because
lombard
does
not
discuss
conscience
or
synderesis
in
any
actual
detail
indeed
he
does
not
strictly
speaking
mention
the
terms
“
synderesis
”
or
“
conscience
”
at
all
what
he
does
is
merely
to
allude
to
jerome
s
commentary
on
ezekiel
in
the
context
of
discussing
the

in
how

that
we

two

wills
one
naturally
oriented
towards
the

another
oriented

is
it
rather
the
case
that

a

that

contains

amongst

who
hold
the

view
the
motivating
power
that
orients
us
towards
the
good
is
called
the
“

”

while
the

towards

resulting

“

with

to

writes
for

that
there
are
two
motivations
one
by
which
a
man
naturally
wants
what
is
good
why
naturally
and
why
is
it
called
“
natural
”
because
such
was
the
motivation
of
human
nature
in
its
original
state
in
which
we
were
created
without
any
defect
and
this
is
properly
called
“
nature
”
for
man
was
created
with
a
righteous
will
man
is
therefore
rightly
said
naturally
to
want
what
is
good
because
he
was
constructed
with
a
good
and
righteous
will
for
the
higher
spark
of

superior
enim

which
as
jerome
says
“

sic
in
the

is
the
full
extent
of
his
treatment
of
conscience
and
synderesis
still
that
was
sufficient
to
ensure
that
it
would
receive
robust
attention
by
later
scholastics
who
would
track
down
the

from

in

to
comment
on
it
a
compilation
of
theological
writings
taken
mainly
from
scripture
and
the
fathers
and
arranged
in

fashion
the
sentences
had
an
enormous
impact
on

enquiry
since
much
it
after
the
1220s
was
carried
out
within
the
taxonomy
that
lombard
had
laid
out
in

work

after

would
continue
well
into
the
sixteenth
century
consisting
of
four
books
each
subdivided
into
chapters
the
sentences
follows
the
distinction
that
saint
augustine
had
drawn
in
the
de
doctrina
christiana
between
the
things
that
are
real
and
the
signs
that
lead
us
back
to
the
former
book

treats
of
god
who
is
really
real
and
his
triune
nature
book
two
deals
with
creation
and
the
fall
including
human
nature
treating
these
as

that
point
back

book
three
treats
of
christ
who
is
the
antidote
to
the
fall
and
who
as
god
incarnate
is
both
thing
and
sign
finally
book
four
treats
of
the
sacraments
which
are
signs
that
assist
the
fallen
in
their
return
to
god
the
ultimate
reality
since
book
two
deals
with
human
moral
psychology
in

and
the
fall
it
is
here
in
distinction
39
that
peter
lombard
s
mention
of
jerome
s
commentary
on
ezekiel
is
found
since
lombard
s
treatment
of
jerome
was
partial
and
elliptical
later
thinkers
in
composing
their
commentaries
on
the
sentences
naturally
turned
to
jerome
s
text
in
order
to
scrutinize
the
original
passage
there
they
discovered
his
apparent
distinction
between
synderesis
and
conscience
which
in
turn
would
come
to
frame
the
parameters
of
the
later
medieval
debate
if
synderesis
and
conscience
are
in
fact
two
separate
parts
of
the
soul
for
instance
what
is
their
relationship
to
one
another
what
come
to
that
are
their
respective
natures
and
rather
importantly
can
they
become
disordered

questions

the

reason

the

draws
reason
towards
what
is
bad
—
specifically
towards
the
sin
of
sensuality
—
while
synderesis
attempts
to
sway
it
towards

it
is

these
two
impulses
freedom

moreover
just
as
the
impulse
to
sin
is
distinct
from
the
soul
so
too
is
synderesis
but
whereas
the
former
inclines
the
agent
towards
evil
the
latter
inclines
him
towards
goodness
is
synderesis
then
a
power
of
the
soul
or
a
habit
this
distinction
goes
back
to
aristotle
for
whom
powers
are
innate
and
associated
with
specific
capacities
while
habits
are
acquired
and
associated
by
contrast
with
tendencies
to
behave
in
certain
ways
habits
moreover
inhere
in
powers
although
both
of
these
properties
dispose
the
agent
to
act
in
particular
ways
powers
in
contrast
to
habits
are
linked
to
the
ability
to
do
so
contingently
if
i
am
in
the
habit
of
speaking
russian
for
instance
then
i
will
have
the
tendency
to
do
so
on
a
regular
basis
it
is
my
preferred
mode
of
communication
and
i
will
take
every
opportunity
to
express
myself
in
that
language
that
i
may
have
the
mere
capacity
—
or
power
—
to
speak
russian
on
the
other
hand
having
studied
it
in
school
say
in
no
way
ensures
that
i
will
do
so
even
in
situations
where
i
probably
should
i
might
for
example
hate
and
resent
speaking
russian
for
various
reasons
and
therefore
freely
refuse
to
do
so

any
circumstances

although
philip
seems
to
favour
the
belief
that
synderesis
is
a
habit
the
claim
that
it
is
a
power
of
the
soul
has
the
rather
weighty
authority
of
st
paul
and
st
jerome
philip
therefore
splits
the
difference
as
it
were
and
argues
that
it
is
a
“
habitlike
power
”
or
“
dispositional
potentiality
”
habitualis
potentiae
—
a
faculty
of
the
soul
that
disposes
its
possessor
towards
choosing
the
unqualified
good
—
though
one
that
is
innate
rather
than
acquired
through
habituation
synderesis
although
the
morphology
of
its
name
makes
it
sound
more
like
a
disposition
than
a
potentiality
is
nevertheless
the
name
of
a
dispositional
potentiality
i
do
not
say
of
an
acquired
disposition
but
of
an
innate
one
and
thus
qua
disposition
it
can
be
applied
to
what
is
related
to
it
as
a
disposition
qua
potentiality
to
what
is
related
to
it
as
a
potentiality
from
this
it
follows
that
it
has
a
certain
opposition
to
free
choice
a
certain
opposition
to
the
impulse
to
sin
and
sensuality
and
a
certain
opposition
to
proheresis
which
is
part
of
free
choice
qua
potentiality
it
is
disparate
from
free
choice
and
from
sensuality
qua
disposition
it
is
disparate
from
proheresis
and
the
impulse
to
sinso
if
anyone
asks
whether
it
is
a
potentiality
or
a
disposition
the
right
answer
lies
in
taking
something
in
between
a
dispositional
potentiality

it
would
seem
then
that
synderesis
is
a
potentiality
albeit
an
unusual
one
is
it
connected
to
the
cognitive
side
of
the
soul
or
to
the
appetitive
according
to
philip
it
is
related
to
the
appetitive
and
specifically
to
the
rational
appetite
that
is
to
the
will
rather
than
to
the
sense
appetite
however
as
we
saw
philip
divides
the
rational
appetite
into
what
he
calls
“
natural
will
”
and
“
deliberative
will
”
the
natural
will
signifies
the
general
inclination
that
humans
have
to
the
good
or
happiness
as
such
such
an
object
is
beyond
the
scope
of
choice
having
said
that
happiness
can
be
achieved
in
any
number
of
ways
and
by
the
acquisition
of
any
number
of
legitimate
though
contingent
goods
indeed
it
is
fair
to
say
that
rational
agents
never
choose
happiness
as
such
given
that
it
is
a
mere
abstraction
rather
what
they
choose
are
particular
goods
which
taken
together
comprise
the
good
life
if
pursued
in
an
orderly
way
such
contingent
goods
are
the
means
to
happiness
and
are
the
objects
of
the
deliberative
will
and
therefore
choice
synderesis
according
to
philip
pertains
to
the
natural
will
it
is
the
remnant
of
original
rectitude
or
justice
which
although
damaged
during
the
fall
remains
in
the
soul
in
diminished
form
as
philip
puts
it
synderesis
is
that
which
“
murmurs
back
against
sin
and
correctly
contemplates

wants
what
is

on
the
matter
of
conscience
and
how
it
is
related
to

philip
distinguishes
them
for
one
thing
conscience
can
be
mistaken
while
synderesis
cannot
specifically
conscience
is
the
result
of
a
concurrence
of
synderesis
with

decision

otherwise
it
is
the
specific
application
of
a
general
moral
principle
that
is

outcome
of

when
correctly
applied
conscience
is
correct
when
incorrectly
applied
it
errs
in
either
case
the
judgement
of
conscience
generates
a
moral
obligation
to
act
philip
uses
the
following
example
of
how
synderesis
which
is
always
right
can
nonetheless
conjoin
with
an
erring
conscience

“
therefore

”
from
the
foregoing
example
it
is
clear
that
synderesis
delivers
a
general
nondeliberative
proposition
while
conscience
yields
what
potts
calls
a
particular
“
deontic
proposition
”
philip
s
argument
is
that
we
need
to
distinguish
between
general
and
particular
propositions
which
are
of
the
form
“
a

where
the

then

what

the

in
order
to
apply

that

are
cognizable
are
very

evident

as
axioms

some

also
in

some
are

“

you
do
not

you
”
and
that
one
should
submit
to

and
suchlike
in
the
same
way
then
as
the
cognition
of
first
principles
is
said
to
be
innate
in
us
by
reason
of
that
light
because
due
to
their
selfevidence
that
light
suffices
for
cognizing
them
after
the
reception
of
species
without
any
additional
persuasion
so
also
the
cognition
of
moral
first
principles
is
innate
in
us
in
that
that
judicatory
suffices
for
cognizing
them
again
in
the

way
as
cognition
of
the
particular
conclusions
of
the
sciences
is
acquired
because
the
light
innate
in
us
does
not
fully
suffice
for
knowing
them
but
some
persuasion
and
fuller
acquaintance
are
needed
so
on
the
side
of
things
that
can
be

we
must
understand
similarly
that
we
are

to
do
some
things

this

between

to
the

whether

can

that

so
long
as
it

it
can

drawing
this
distinction
he
seems
to
mean
something
like
the
following
about
the
primary
precepts
of
the
natural
law
noone
can
go
wrong
unfortunately
as
we
have
seen
such
precepts
are
of
a
very
general
character
such
as
“
do
good
and
avoid
evil
”
for
such
general
knowledge
to
be
applicable
by
conscience
it
must
be
further
specified
this
further
specification
comprises
the
secondary
precepts
of
the
natural
law
which
are
closely
drawn
from
the
former
precepts
and
from
natural
inclination
about
such
secondary
derived
precepts
of
the
natural
law
such
as
“
adultery
is
to
be
avoided
”
humans
are
all
too
prone
to
become
ignorant
for
aquinas
such
ignorance
is
the
result
either
of
vice
or
of
having
been
socialized
in
a
culture
with
“
vicious
customs
”
i
answer
that
there
belongs
to
the
natural
law
first
certain
most
general
precepts
that
are
known
to
all
and
secondly
certain
secondary
and
more
detailed
precepts
which
are
as
it
were
conclusions
following
closely
from
first
principles
as
to
those
general
principles
the
natural
law
in
the
abstract
can
nowise
be
blotted
out
from
men
s
hearts
but
as
to
the
secondary
precepts
the
natural
law
can
be
blotted
out
from
the
human
heart
either
by
evil
persuasions
just
as
in
speculative
matters
errors
occur
in
respect
of
necessary
conclusions
or
by
vicious
customs
and
corrupt
habits

a

problem

are
we
not
according

s
account
of
the

left
with
the
possibility
of
a

dilemma
for
if
we

an

we
sometimes

when
we
do

then
it

we

we
seem
that
is
to
sometimes
have

so
that
regardless
of
what
we
do
we

aquinas
s
solution
is
that
it
is
only
wrong
to
follow
a
conscience
that
is
in
a
state
of
vincible
ignorance
since
such
ignorance
is
by
definition
correctable
we
can
always
resolve
the
apparent
dilemma
by
choosing
to
put

our

is

new
directions
in
the
understanding
of
synderesis
and
conscience
with
the
fourteenthcentury
theologian
william
of
ockham
1285
–
1347
we
encounter
some
radically
new
developments
on
the
topics
of
synderesis
and
conscience
while
ockham
s
franciscan
predecessor
john
duns
scotus
had
disagreements
with
aquinas
about
the
nature
of
the
moral
law
scotus
fundamentally
agreed
with
the
dominican
in
viewing
synderesis
and
conscience
a
habit
and
an
act
of
the
practical
reason
respectively
whose
jobs
were
to
apprehend
the
basic
principles
of
morality
in
the
case
of
synderesis
and
to
apply
them
in
the
case
of
conscience

like
scotus
ockham
also
agrees
with
aquinas
in
several
crucial
respects
where
ockham
departs
from
aquinas
and
indeed
with
the
entire
scholastic
tradition
which
preceded
him
however
is
in
his
abandonment
of
the
concept
of
synderesis
and
in
his
unique
approach
to
the
invincibly
erroneous
conscience
it
is
difficult
to
know
for
certain
why
ockham
abandoned
the
concept
of
synderesis
michael
baylor
however
has
suggested
two
possibilities
the
first
is
that
as
we
have
seen
synderesis
was
regarded
by
ockham
s
predecessors
like
aquinas
as
an
inborn
habit
but
for
ockham
rational
agents
only
come
to
possess
habits
by
acquiring
them
and
they
can
only
acquire
them
by
doing
the
relevant
acts
repeatedly
the
notion
that
a
habit
could
be
innate
then
would
have
seemed
incoherent
to
ockham
baylor

the
second
possible
explanation
—
though
baylor
thinks
this
implausible
—
has
to
do
with
the
way
that
ockham
understands
the
foundations
of
morality
as
compared
with
aquinas
for
ockham
there
is
no
essential
connection
between
the
moral
order
as
it
currently
exists
and
the
divine
wisdom
the
highest
norm
of
morality
is
the
divine
will
it
just
so
happens
that
murder
for
example
is
wrong
today
but
there
is
no
reason
that
god
could
not
make
murder
right
tomorrow
if
he
so
willed
the
moral
order
in
short
is
contingent
on
the
thomistic
view
however
the
natural
law
is
a
participation
in
the
eternal
law
it
is
the
point
of
contact
between
god
s
plan
for
us
as
conceived
in
the
divine
mind
on
the
one
hand
and
the
human
intellect
on
the
other
synderesis
as
we
saw
above
plays
a
key
role
in
this
connection
insofar
as
it
grasps
the
moral
principles
that
lead
human
beings
to
their
final
destiny
moreover
the
moral
principles
that
guide
us
in
how
to
achieve
our
final
end
are
as
true
today
as
they
were
yesterday
and
indeed
will
be
for
all
time
owing
to
the
natures
that
god
has
bestowed
upon
us
as
baylor
writes
as
the
element
of
man
s
original
nature
which
was
substantially
undamaged
after
adam
s
fall
the
synteresis
was
the
anthropological
point
of
connection
between
an
abiding
moral
order
which
manifested
ideas
in
the
divine
intellect
according
to
which
creation
was
necessarily
ordered
and
man
s
certain
knowledge
of
universal
principles
of
that
moral
order
ockham
however
stressed
the
absolute
contingency
of
creation
for
ockham
god
s
will
as
manifested
in
the
moral
precepts
he
has
ordained
constitutes
the
ultimate
and
objective
norm
of
morality
god
is
under
no
obligation
rather
it
is
divine
will
which
determines
moral
obligation
this
awesome
conception
of
divine
liberty
and
omnipotence
and
the
contingency
of
the
created
order
has
led
many
to
the
conclusion
that
the
objective
basis
of
ockham
s
ethics
is
authoritarian
or
positivistic
and
inherently
unstable
since
it
appears
to
depend
only
upon
an
alterable
divine
fiat
if
this
were
so
then
it
would
appear
odd
also
to
posit
within
man
an
inborn
and
inalienable
knowledge
of
moral
principles
in
the
form
of
synteresis
baylor
1977

a
distinguished
proponent
of
the
interpretation
baylor
describes
was
servais
pinckaers
because
the
foundations
of
morality
are
rooted
in
the
divine
will
which
can
change
there
was
no
need
for
ockham
to
resort
to
a
mechanism
that
discovers
the
eternal
principles
of
morality
as
these
emerge
from
human
nature
since
for
ockham
no
such
principles
exist
rather
according
to
pinckaers
interpretation
of
ockham
moral
principles
are
known
through
revelation
pinckaers
1993
258
while
pinckaers
was
correct
in
his
assessment
of
ockham
s
metaethics
—
which
is
fundamentally
authoritarian
despite
elements
of
rationalism
—
he
was
wrong
in
his
characterization
of
ockham
s
moral
epistemology
this
is
because
while
it
is
indeed
possible
to
come
to
know
the
principles
of
morality
via
divine
revelation
on
ockham
s
account
it
is
also
possible
despite
their
grounding
in
god
s
will
to
come
to
know
them
via
natural
reason
and
experience
see

examples
of
the
former
that
is
of
principles
that
are
selfevidently
true
are
“
every
blameworthy
evil
is
to
be
avoided
”
and
“
the
will
ought
to
conform
itself
to
right
reason
”
an
example
of
a
moral
proposition
that
is
grounded
in
experience
on
the
other
hand
is
“
an
angry
man
should
be
calmed

god
obviously
wills
that
we
should
follow
such
injunctions
but
how
can
we
know
his
will
if
not
through
revelation
although
the
contemporary
philosopher
peter
geach
was
not
a
particularly
sympathetic
reader
of
ockham
he
was
willing
to
concede
the
possibility
that
a
metaethics
grounded
in
divine
commands
could
nonetheless
yield
a
naturalistic
moral
epistemology
as
he
put
it
the
rational
recognition
that
a
practice
is
generally
undesirable
and
that
it
is
best
for
people
on
the
whole
not
even
to
think
of
resorting
to
it
is
thus
in
fact
a
promulgation
to
a
man
of
the
divine
law
forbidding
the
practice
even
if
he
does
not
realise
that
this
is
a
promulgation
of
the
divine
law
even
if
he
does
not
believe
there
is
a
god
geach
1981

ockham
would
have
agreed
a
second
and
related
way
in
which
pinckaers
misinterpreted
ockham
s
moral
epistemology
was
pinckaers
assumption
that
because
ockham
discarded
the
traditional
notion
of
synderesis
he
must
have
done
the
same
for
its
twin
concept
of
conscience
pinckaers
conceded
that
moral
principles
even
if
rooted
in
the
divine
will
still
need
to
be
applied
to
particular
situations
on
ockham
s
account
this
role
was
of
course
reserved
for
conscience
in
the
earlier
tradition
in
ockham
according
to
pinckaers
this
role
now
became
associated
with
practical
reason
and
prudence
pinckaers
1993
259
a
closer
reading
of
the
textual
evidence
suggests
that
ockham
very
much
made
use
of
the
traditional
concept
of
conscience
indeed
much
of
how
he
employed
the
concept
was
consistent
with
the
tradition
especially
as
articulated
by
aquinas
ockham
associates
the
dictates
of
practical
reason
for
example
with
judgements
of
conscience
he
is
also
emphatic
in
his
belief
that
rational
agents
have
an
absolute
obligation
to
follow
their
consciences
which
can
be
correct
or
erroneous

a
conscience
is
correct
when
it
is
in
accord
with
right
reason
it
is
erroneous
when
it
is
not
finally
an
erroneous
conscience
for
ockham
as
with
aquinas
is
either
in
a
state
of
vincible
—
voluntary
and
therefore
culpable
—
ignorance
or
in
a
state
of
invincible
—
or
involuntary
—
ignorance
where
conscience
is
in
a
state
of
vincible
ignorance
we
must
do
our
best
to
set
it
aside
in
all
these
cases
ockham
follows
the
tradition
with
one
exception
that
of
the
invincibly
erroneous
conscience
eardley
2013
94
–
98
the
state
in
which
the
agent
finds
himself
with
the
correct
universal
principles
but
nonculpably
errs
with
respect
to
his
grasp
of
the
circumstances
in
which
he
finds
himself
in
what
sense
does
ockham
depart
from
the
tradition
for
ockham
the
act
of
following
an
invincibly
erroneous
conscience
is
not
merely
excusable
as
it
was
for
aquinas
but
“
virtuous
and
meritorious
”
consider
the
following
example
from
ockham
while
walking
down
the
street
one
day
you
pass
a
homeless
person
who
asks
you
for
money
he
appears
to
have
a
moral
claim
on
you
since
you
assent
to
the
moral
principle
that
“
help
is
to
be
given
to
every
needy
person
in
extreme
need
lest
he
die
”
does
he
appear
needy
and
indeed
desperate
to
you
yes
sizing
him
up
you
determine
that
although
it
is
theoretically
possible
that
he
could
be
fraud
this
seems
unlikely
for
ockham
you
are
obliged
in
this
instance
to
follow
your
conscience
and
indeed
you
do
it
turns
out
however
that
this
apparent
homeless
person
is
in
fact
a
very
wealthy
person
who
is
impersonating
a
beggar
for
ockham
in
following
your
conscience
you
are
not
merely
excused
or
absolved
of
your
error
but
your
ignorant
act
is
virtuous
and
indeed
regarded
by
god
as
meritorious
so
long
that
is
that
your
act
of
charity
is
done
out
of
love
for
god
as
ockham
puts
it
consequently
in
the
above
case
a
right
act
of
the
will
and
an
error
of
the
intellect
remain
at
the
same
time
with
respect
to
the
same
object
and
the
whole
reason
is
because
that
error
is
not
in
the
power
of
the
one
who
is
mistaken
who
took
all
due
diligence
to
find
out
the
truth
and
therefore
that
error
excuses
from
every
sin
and
consequently
the
will
that
elicits
the
act
in
conformity
to
such
invincibly
erroneous
reason
acts
virtuously
and
meritoriously
indeed
had
he
not
while
in
such
error
willed
to
help
that
person
he
would
have
performed
a
vicious
and
demeritorious
act
because
such
an
act
would
have
been
knowingly
elicited
against
conscience
and
against
nonculpable
reason
because
in
the
aforementioned
case
he
does
not
know
that
he
is
in
error
but
believes
that
he
possesses
right
reason
and
consequently
by
despising
reason
in
this
way
he
sins

what
is
motivating
ockham
s
novel
suggestion
even
aquinas
admitted
that
we
have
an
obligation
to
follow
our
consciences
whether
right
or
erroneous
when
we
do
not
do
so
according
to
aquinas
we
sin
of
course
when
our
consciences
are
in
a
state
of
voluntary
or
vincible
ignorance
we
also
have
a
duty
to
put
aside
our
error
otherwise
we
sin
it
is
obviously
not
possible
however
to
put
error
aside
in
the
case
of
invincible
ignorance
since
such
ignorance
is
by
definition
involuntary
accordingly
for
aquinas
we
are
obliged
to
follow
such
a
conscience
although
we
act
wrongly
in
such
cases
we
are
for
aquinas
excused
on
the
grounds
that
we
could
not
have
known
better
to
return
to
aquinas
s
example
of
inadvertently
sleeping
with
someone
who
is
not
your
spouse
this
might
be
excusable
for
aquinas
but
there
is
no
possibility
that
such
an
act
might
be
considered
virtuous
much
less
meritorious
but
for
ockham
if
it
is
vicious
and
therefore
punishable
not
to
follow
an
invincibly
erroneous
conscience
then
merely
being
excused
for
following
it
when
we
are
under
a
moral
obligation
to
do
so
would
be
an
insufficient
reward
rather
it
should
logically
follow
that
it
is
virtuous
and
therefore
meritorious

why
did
the
experience
of
consciousness
evolve
from
our
underlying
brain
physiology
despite
being
a
vibrant
area
of
neuroscience
current
research
on
consciousness
is
characterised
by
disagreement
and
controversy
–
with
several
rival
theories
in
contention
a
recent
scoping
review
of
over
1000
articles
identified
over
20
different
theoretical
accounts
philosophers
like
david
chalmers
argue
that
no
single
scientific
theory
can
truly
explain
consciousness
we
define
consciousness
as
embodied
subjective
awareness
including
self
awareness
in
a
recent
article
published
in
interalia
which
is
not
peer
reviewed
we
argue
that
one
reason
for
this
predicament
is
the
powerful
role
played
by
intuition
we
are
not
alone
social
scientist
jacy
reese
anthis
writes
“
much
of
the
debate
on
the
fundamental
nature
of
consciousness
takes
the
form
of
intuition
jousting
in
which
the
different
parties
each
report
their
own
strong
intuitions
and
joust
them
against
each
other
”
dangers
of
intuition
key
intuitive
beliefs
–
for
example
that
our
mental
processes
are
distinct
from
our
physical
bodies
mindbody
dualism
and
that
our
mental
processes
give
rise
to
and
control
our
decisions
and
actions
mental
causation
–
are
supported
by
a
lifetime
of
subjective
experiences
these
beliefs
are
found
in
all
human
cultures
they
are
important
as
they
serve
as
foundational
beliefs
for
most
liberal
democracies
and
criminal
justice
systems
they
are
resistant
to
counter
evidence
that
s
because
they
are
powerfully
endorsed
by
social
and
cultural
concepts
such
as
free
will
human
rights
democracy
justice
and
moral
responsibility
all
these
concepts
assume
that
consciousness
plays
a
central
controlling
influence
intuition
however
is
an
automatic
cognitive
process
that
evolved
to
provide
fast
trusted
explanations
and
predictions
in
fact
it
does
so
without
the
need
for
us
to
know
how
or
why
we
know
it
the
outcomes
of
intuition
therefore
shape
how
we
perceive
and
explain
our
everyday
world
without
the
need
for
extensive
reflection
or
formal
analytic
explanations
while
helpful
and
indeed
crucial
for
many
everyday
activities
intuitive
beliefs
can
be
wrong
they
can
also
interfere
with
scientific
literacy
intuitive
accounts
of
consciousness
ultimately
put
us
in
the
driver
s
seat
as
“
captain
of
our
own
ship
”
we
think
we
know
what
consciousness
is
and
what
it
does
from
simply
experiencing
it
mental
thoughts
intentions
and
desires
are
seen
as
determining
and
controlling
our
actions
the
widespread
acceptance
of
these
tacit
intuitive
accounts
helps
explain
in
part
why
the
formal
study
of
consciousness
was
relegated
to
the
margins
of
mainstream
neuroscience
until
late
20th
century
the
problem
for
scientific
models
of
consciousness
remains
accommodating
these
intuitive
accounts
within
a
materialist
framework
consistent
with
the
findings
of
neuroscience
while
there
is
no
current
scientific
explanation
for
how
brain
tissue
generates
or
maintains
subjective
experience
the
consensus
among
most
neuroscientists
is
that
it
is
a
product
of
brain
processes
social
purpose
if
that
s
the
case
why
did
consciousness
defined
as
subjective
awareness
evolve
consciousness
presumably
evolved
as
part
of
the
evolution
of
the
nervous
system
according
to
several
theories
the
key
adaptive
function
providing
an
organism
with
survival
and
reproductive
benefits
of
consciousness
is
to
make
volitional
movement
possible
and
volition
is
something
we
ultimately
associate
with
will
agency
and
individuality
it
is
therefore
easy
to
think
that
consciousness
evolved
to
benefit
us
as
individuals
humans
are
a
highly
social
species
esteban
de
armasshuttestock
but
we
have
argued
that
consciousness
may
have
evolved
to
facilitate
key
social
adaptive
functions
rather
than
helping
individuals
survive
it
evolved
to
help
us
broadcast
our
experienced
ideas
and
feelings
into
the
wider
world
and
this
might
benefit
the
survival
and
wellbeing
of
the
wider
species
the
idea
fits
with
new
thinking
on
genetics
while
evolutionary
science
traditionally
focuses
on
individual
genes
there
is
growing
recognition
that
natural
selection
among
humans
operates
at
multiple
levels
for
example
culture
and
society
influence
traits
passed
on
between
generations
–
we
value
some
more
than
others
central
to
our
account
is
the
idea
that
sociality
the
tendency
of
groups
and
individuals
to
develop
social
links
and
live
in
communities
is
a
key
survival
strategy
that
influences
how
the
brain
and
cognition
evolve
adopting
this
social
evolutionary
framework
we
propose
that
subjective
awareness
lacks
any
independent
capacity
to
causally
influence
other
psychological
processes
or
actions
an
example
would
be
initiating
a
course
of
action
the
idea
that
subjective
awareness
has
a
social
purpose
has
been
described
previously
by
other
reserachers
the
claim
that
subjective
awareness
is
without
causal
influence
however
is
not
to
deny
the
reality
of
subjective
experience
or
claim
that
the
experience
is
an
illusion
while
our
model
removes
subjective
awareness
from
the
traditional
driving
seat
of
the
mind
it
does
not
imply
that
we
don
t
value
private
internal
experiences
indeed
it
is
precisely
because
of
the
value
we
place
on
these
experiences
that
intuitive
accounts
remain
compelling
and
widespread
in
social
and
legal
organisation
systems
and
psychology
while
it
is
counterintuitive
to
attribute
agency
and
personal
accountability
to
a
biological
assembly
of
nerve
cells
it
makes
sense
that
highly
valued
social
constructs
such
as
free
will
truth

people
in

think
about
it
while
we
are

our
social
nature
is
largely
defined
by
our
roles
and
interactions
in
society

such
the
mental
architecture
of
the
mind
should
be
strongly
adapted
for
the

ideas

consequently
while

as

are
incapable

executive
consciously
acknowledging
an
error
or
weakness
as
well
as
a
strength
is
the
starting
point
for
learning
and
generating
improvements
through
concrete
actions
this
is
precisely
what
conscious
leadership
is
about
next
we
will
provide
more
information
about
this
new
type
of
leadership
explaining
its
characteristics
the
skills
involved
and
the
benefits
it
brings
to
organizations
and
their
teams
 
what
is
conscious
leadership
 
the
key
to
this
type
of
leadership
is
precisely
the
consciousness
of
the
act
of
leading
it
means
that
being
aware
is
not
just
about
realizing
it
but
also
about
being
capable
of
reflecting
on
our
actions
roles
and
the
repercussions
of
the
actions
we
execute
this
type
of
leadership
implies
that
those
in
charge
of
a
company
s
destiny
are
fully
present
in
their
roles
committed
and
engaged
only
from
there
can
they
make
conscious
decisions
generating
trust
and
inspiring
teams
an
essential
aspect
of
practicing
conscious
leadership
is
taking
responsibility
for
mistakes
and
learning
from
them
while
also
analyzing
successes
to
replicate
them
all
of
this
is
done
in
order
to
better
guide
teams
and
the
company
 
difference
from
traditional
leadership
conscious
leadership
and
traditional
leadership
are
not
differentiated
by
just
a
single
word
while
traditional
leadership
focuses
on
achieving
economic
results
conscious
leadership
places
emphasis
on
three
aspects
of
value
generation
within
the
company
profitability
social
development
and
environmental
care
additionally
traditional
leadership
revolves
around
a
leader
who
prioritizes
these
results
over
personal
attributes
when
making
decisions
whereas
conscious
leadership
requires
a
leader
who
seeks
selfawareness
this
entails
understanding
one
s
strengths
and
weaknesses
as
well
as
the
importance
of
making
decisions
and
acting
with
social
and
ethical
responsibility
this
significant
difference
makes
conscious
leadership
the
result
of
a
reflective
process
in
which
the
leader
knows
oneself
to
then
know
and
accept
others
the
challenge
lies
in
promoting
and
implementing
within
work
teams
the
aspects
qualities
and
business
skills
that
echo
conscious
leadership
 
 
 
the
importance
of
a
conscious
leader
a
conscious
leader
is
a
figure
that
is
increasingly
gaining
prominence
in
companies
consciousness
applied
to
decisionmaking
within
an
organization
is
crucial
for
leading
positive
changes
why
because
it
allows
for
the
consideration
of
different
variables
involved
in
a
way
conscious
leadership
is
based
on
the
idea
that
conscious
leaders
can
make
a
difference
and
lead
their
teams
towards
excellence
happiness
and
wellbeing
adopting
this
approach
by
the
leader
is
important
as
it
can
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
company
s
culture
employee
satisfaction
and
team
performance
 
characteristics
of
a
conscious
leader
a
good
conscious
leader
doesn
t
just
have
to
appear
to
be
one
but
actually
be
one
here
are
some
of
the
general
characteristics
they
should
possess
1
ability
to
listen
it
s
not
always
the
time
to
speak
but
often
the
time
to
listen
and
it
should
be
done
actively
paying
attention
to
every
detail
conveyed
by
the
words
and
body
language
of
others
2
the
importance
of
leading
by
example
to
be
a
good
conscious
leader
you
must
preach
and
practice
at
the
same
time
leading
by
example
allows
the
team
to
see
that
you
re
the
first
person
to
align
yourself
with
the
principles
you
promote
3
promoting
collaboration
encourage
not
only
teamwork
but
also
collaboration
among
members
of
the
organization
and
foster
healthy
competition
4
observational
skills
it
s
not
just
about
taking
action
as
a
conscious
leader
you
should
have
the
ability
to
step
back
and
gain
perspective
observe
and
consider
alternative
options
bringing
forth
new
ideas
5
clarity
decisions
should
be
made
with
clarity
as
the
team
needs
to
see
that
you
are
confident
in
your
actions
which
generates
the
necessary
trust
within
the
team
6
the
importance
of
smiling
it
s
important
to
convey
calmness
and
happiness
even
in
challenging
circumstances
fostering
a
happy
team
translates
into
a
motivated
team
that
performs
better
7
assertiveness
communication
from
a
conscious
leader
is
consistently
assertive
they
express
their
thoughts
and
ideas
honestly
and
simply
this
allows
each
team
member
to
know
what
is
expected
of
them
fostering
confidence
and
clarity
in
their
work
lives
8
recognizing
mistakes
as
mentioned
earlier
a
conscious
leader
is
based
on
selfawareness
which
involves
recognizing
mistakes
acknowledging
mistakes
is
the
foundation
for
improvement
and
change
this
is
not
seen
as
a
weakness
by
the
team
but
rather
as
a
sign
of
a
human
leader
who
is
continuously
striving
for
improvement
 
advantages
of
conscious
leadership
when
it
comes
to
benefits
there
are
several
advantages
associated
with
conscious
leadership
such
as
the
following
1
better
understanding
of
the
company
s
vision
conscious
leadership
involves
identifying
and
calibrating
the
different
and
most
important
aspects
of
the
organization
so
that
the
team
can
focus
on
them
a
conscious
leader
considers
goals
in
relation
to
the
purpose
and
vision
of
the
company
2
talent
development
conscious
leadership
attracts
talent
to
companies
moreover
through
the
development
of
good
practices
talent
chooses
to
stay
because
it
s
not
about
retention
but
rather
growth
3
improved
work
relationships
as
mentioned
before
a
conscious
leader
promotes
positive
teamwork
and
collaboration
this
leads
to
better
project
outcomes
and
fewer
interpersonal
conflicts
since
the
emphasis
is
on
group
performance
rather
than
individual
contributions
4
increased
job
satisfaction
it
s
not
just
about
directing
but
also
about
motivating
teams
and
helping
them
improve
encouraging
them
to
become
drivers
of
change
and
innovation
within
the
company
5
higher
productivity
when
employees
feel
valued
engaged
motivated
and
satisfied
employee
turnover
decreases
and
absenteeism
reduces
resulting
in
increased
productivity
6
inspiring
leadership
soft
skills
are
promoted
which
allow
for
greater
wellbeing
from
within
to
the
outside
being
at
peace
with
oneself
translates
into
being
at
peace
with
others

the
words
conscious
and
consciousness
in
the
english
language
date
to
the
17th
century
and
the
first
recorded
use
of
conscious
as
a
simple
adjective
was
applied
figuratively
to
inanimate
objects
the
conscious
groves
1643
6
175
it
derived
from
the
latin
conscius
con
together
and
scio
to
know
which
meant
knowing
with
or
having
joint
or
common
knowledge
with
another
especially
as
in
sharing
a
secret
7
thomas
hobbes
in
leviathan
1651
wrote
where
two
or
more
men
know
of
one
and
the
same
fact
they
are
said
to
be
conscious
of
it
one
to
another
8
there
were
also
many
occurrences
in
latin
writings
of
the
phrase
conscius
sibi
which
translates
literally
as
knowing
with
oneself
or
in
other
words
sharing
knowledge
with
oneself
about
something
this
phrase
has
the
figurative
sense
of
knowing
that
one
knows
which
is
something
like
the
modern
english
word
conscious
but
it
was
rendered
into
english
as
conscious
to
oneself
or
conscious
unto
oneself
for
example
archbishop
ussher
wrote
in
1613
of
being
so
conscious
unto
myself
of
my
great
weakness
9
the
latin
conscientia
literally
knowledgewith
first
appears
in
roman
juridical
texts
by
writers
such
as
cicero
it
means
a
kind
of
shared
knowledge
with
moral
value
specifically
what
a
witness
knows
of
someone
else
s
deeds

although
rené

1650
writing
in
latin
is
generally
taken
to
be
the
first
philosopher
to
use
conscientia
in
a
way
less
like
the
traditional
meaning
and
more
like
the
way
modern
english
speakers
would
use
conscience
his
meaning
is
nowhere
defined

the
origin
of
the

of

is

attributed
to

who
defined
the
word
in

published
in

as
the

consciousness
philosophers
have
used
the
term
consciousness
for
four
main
topics
knowledge
in
general
intentionality
introspection
and
the
knowledge
it
specifically
generates
and
phenomenal
experience
something
within
one
s
mind
is
introspectively
conscious
just
in
case
one
introspects
it
or
is
poised
to
do
so
introspection
is
often
thought
to
deliver
one
s
primary
knowledge
of
one
s
mental
life
an
experience
or
other
mental
entity
is
phenomenally
conscious
just
in
case
there
is
something
it
is
like
for
one
to
have
it
the
clearest
examples
are
perceptual
experience
such
as
tastings
and
seeings
bodilysensational
experiences
such
as
those
of
pains

imaginative

and
streams

as
in
the

23
traditional
metaphors
for
mind
edit
during
the
early
19th
century
the
emerging
field
of
geology
inspired
a
popular
metaphor
that
the
mind
likewise
had
hidden
layers
which
recorded
the
past
of
the
individual
24
3
by
1875
most
psychologists
believed
that
consciousness
was
but
a
small
part
of
mental
life24
3
and
this
idea
underlies
the
goal
of
freudian
therapy
to
expose
the
unconscious
layer
of
the
mind
other
metaphors
from
various
sciences
inspired
other
analyses
of
the
mind
for
example
johann
friedrich
herbart
described
ideas
as
being
attracted
and
repulsed
like
magnets
john
stuart
mill
developed
the
idea
of
mental
chemistry
and
mental
compounds
and
edward
b
titchener
sought
the
structure
of
the
mind
by
analyzing
its
elements
the
abstract
idea
of
states
of
consciousness
mirrored
the
concept
of
states
of
matter
in
1892
william
james
noted
that
the
ambiguous
word
content
has
been
recently
invented
instead
of
object
and
that
the
metaphor
of
mind
as
a
container
seemed
to
minimize
the
dualistic
problem
of
how
states
of
consciousness
can
know
things
or
objects25
465
by
1899
psychologists
were
busily
studying
the
contents
of
conscious
experience
by
introspection
and
experiment
26
365
another
popular
metaphor
was
james
s
doctrine
of
the
stream
of
consciousness
with
continuity
fringes
and
transitions
25
vii
a
james
discussed
the
difficulties
of
describing
and
studying
psychological
phenomena
recognizing
that
commonlyused
terminology
was
a
necessary
and
acceptable
starting
point
towards
more
precise
scientifically
justified
language
prime
examples
were
phrases
like
inner
experience
and
personal
consciousness
the
first
and
foremost
concrete
fact
which
every
one
will
affirm
to
belong
to
his
inner
experience
is
the
fact
that
consciousness
of
some
sort
goes
on
states
of
mind
succeed
each
other
in
him
but
everyone
knows
what
the
terms
mean
only
in
a
rough
way
when
i
say
every
state
or
thought
is
part
of
a
personal
consciousness
personal
consciousness
is
one
of
the
terms
in
question
its
meaning
we
know
so
long
as
no
one
asks
us
to
define
it
but
to
give
an
accurate
account
of
it
is
the
most
difficult
of
philosophic
tasks
the
only
states
of

that
we
naturally

from
introspection
to
awareness
edit
prior
to
the
20th
century
philosophers
treated
the
phenomenon
of
consciousness
as
the
inner
world
of
one
s
own
mind
and
introspection
was
the
mind
attending
to
itselfb
an
activity
seemingly
distinct
from
that
of
perceiving
the
outer
world
and
its
physical
phenomena
in
1892
william
james
noted
the
distinction
along
with
doubts
about
the
inward
character
of
the
mind
things
have
been
doubted
but
thoughts
and
feelings
have
never
been
doubted
the
outer
world
but
never
the
inner
world
has
been
denied
everyone
assumes
that
we
have
direct
introspective
acquaintance
with
our
thinking
activity
as
such
with
our
consciousness
as
something
inward
and
contrasted
with
the
outer
objects
which
it
knows
yet
i
must
confess
that
for
my
part
i
cannot
feel
sure
of
this
conclusion
it
seems
as
if
consciousness
as
an
inner
activity
were
rather
a
postulate
than
a
sensibly
given
fact
25
467
by
the
1960s
for
many
philosophers
and
psychologists
who
talked
about
consciousness
the
word
no
longer
meant
the
inner
world
but
an
indefinite
large
category
called
awareness
as
in
the
following
example
it
is
difficult
for
modern
western
man
to
grasp
that
the
greeks
really
had
no
concept
of
consciousness
in
that
they
did
not
class
together
phenomena
as
varied
as
problem
solving
remembering
imagining
perceiving
feeling
pain
dreaming
and
acting
on
the
grounds
that
all
these
are
manifestations
of
being
aware
or
being
conscious
28

many
philosophers
and
scientists
have
been
unhappy
about
the
difficulty
of
producing
a
definition
that
does
not
involve
circularity
or
fuzziness
29
in
the
macmillan
dictionary
of
psychology
1989
edition
stuart
sutherland
emphasized
external
awareness
and
expressed
a
skeptical
attitude
more
than
a
definition
consciousness
—
the
having
of
perceptions
thoughts
and
feelings
awareness
the
term
is
impossible
to
define
except
in
terms
that
are
unintelligible
without
a
grasp
of
what
consciousness
means
many
fall
into
the
trap
of
equating
consciousness
with
selfconsciousness
—
to
be
conscious
it
is
only
necessary
to
be
aware
of
the
external
world
consciousness
is
a
fascinating
but
elusive
phenomenon
it
is
impossible
to
specify
what
it
is
what
it
does
or
why
it
has
evolved
nothing
worth
reading
has
been
written
on
it
29
using
awareness
however
as
a
definition
or
synonym
of
consciousness
is
not
a
simple
matter
if
awareness
of
the
environment
is
the
criterion
of
consciousness
then
even
the
protozoans
are
conscious
if
awareness
of
awareness
is
required
then
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
great
apes
and
human
infants
are
conscious
26
influence
on
research
edit
many
philosophers
have
argued
that
consciousness
is
a
unitary
concept
that
is
understood
by
the
majority
of
people
despite
the
difficulty
philosophers
have
had
defining
it
30
max
velmans
proposed
that
the
everyday
understanding
of
consciousness
uncontroversially
refers
to
experience
itself
rather
than
any
particular
thing
that
we
observe
or
experience
and
he
added
that
consciousness
is
therefore
exemplified
by
all
the
things
that
we
observe
or
experience31
4
whether
thoughts
feelings
or
perceptions
velmans
noted
however
as
of
2009
that
there
was
a
deep
level
of
confusion
and
internal
division31
among
experts
about
the
phenomenon
of
consciousness
because
researchers
lacked
a
sufficiently
wellspecified
use
of
the
term
to
agree
that
they
are
investigating
the
same
thing
31
3
he
argued
additionally
that
preexisting
theoretical
commitments
to
competing
explanations
of
consciousness
might
be
a
source
of
bias
within
the
modern
consciousness
studies
community
the
technical
phrase
phenomenal
consciousness
is
a
common
synonym
for
all
forms
of
awareness
or
simply
experience
31

without
differentiating
between
inner
and
outer
or
between
higher
and
lower
types
with
advances
in
brain
research
the
presence
or
absence
of
experienced
phenomena31
3
of
any
kind
underlies
the
work
of
those
neuroscientists
who
seek
to
analyze
the
precise
relation
of
conscious
phenomenology
to
its
associated
information
processing
in
the
brain
31
10
this
neuroscientific
goal
is
to
find
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
ncc
one
criticism
of
this
goal
is
that
it
begins
with
a
theoretical
commitment
to
the
neurological
origin
of
all
experienced
phenomena
whether
inner
or
outer
c
also
the
fact
that
the
easiest
content
of
consciousness
to
be
so
analyzed
is
the
experienced
threedimensional
world
the
phenomenal
world
beyond
the
body
surface31
4
invites
another
criticism
that
most
consciousness
research
since
the
1990s
perhaps
because
of
bias
has
focused
on
processes
of
external
perception
33
from
a
history
of
psychology
perspective
julian
jaynes
rejected
popular
but
superficial
views
of
consciousness2
447
especially
those
which
equate
it
with
that
vaguest
of
terms
experience
24
8
in
1976
he
insisted
that
if
not
for
introspection
which
for
decades
had
been
ignored
or
taken
for
granted
rather
than
explained
there
could
be
no
conception
of
what
consciousness
is24
18
and
in
1990
he
reaffirmed
the
traditional
idea
of
the
phenomenon
called
consciousness
writing
that
its
denotative
definition
is
as
it
was
for
rené
descartes
john
locke
and
david
hume
what
is
introspectable
2
450
jaynes
saw
consciousness
as
an
important
but
small
part
of
human
mentality
and
he
asserted
there
can
be
no
progress
in
the
science
of
consciousness
until
 
what
is
introspectable
is
sharply
distinguished2
447
from
the
unconscious
processes
of
cognition
such
as
perception
reactive
awareness
and
attention
and
automatic
forms
of
learning
problemsolving
and
decisionmaking

the
cognitive
science
point
of
view
—
with
an
interdisciplinary
perspective
involving
fields
such
as
psychology
linguistics
and
anthropology34
—
requires
no
agreed
definition
of
consciousness
but
studies
the
interaction
of
many
processes
besides
perception
for
some
researchers
consciousness
is
linked
to
some
kind
of
selfhood
for
example
to
certain
pragmatic
issues
such
as
the
feeling
of
agency
and
the
effects
of
regret33
and
action
on
experience
of
one
s
own
body
or
social
identity
35
similarly
daniel
kahneman
who
focused
on
systematic
errors
in
perception
memory
and
decisionmaking
has
differentiated
between
two
kinds
of
mental
processes
or
cognitive
systems36
the
fast
activities
that
are
primary
automatic
and
cannot
be
turned
off36
22
and
the
slow
deliberate
effortful
activities
of
a
secondary
system
often
associated
with
the
subjective
experience
of
agency
choice
and
concentration
36
13
kahneman
s
two
systems
have
been
described
as
roughly
corresponding
to
unconscious
and
conscious
processes
37
8
the
two
systems
can
interact
for
example
in
sharing
the
control
of
attention
36
22
while
system
1
can
be
impulsive
system
2
is
in
charge
of
selfcontrol36
26
and
when
we
think
of
ourselves
we
identify
with
system
2
the
conscious
reasoning
self
that
has
beliefs
makes
choices
and
decides
what
to
think
about
and
what
to
do
36
21
some
have
argued
that
we
should
eliminate
the
concept
from
our
understanding
of
the
mind
a
position
known
as
consciousness
semanticism
38
in
medicine
a
level
of
consciousness
terminology
is
used
to
describe
a
patient
s
arousal
and
responsiveness
which
can
be
seen
as
a
continuum
of
states
ranging
from
full
alertness
and
comprehension
through
disorientation
delirium
loss
of
meaningful
communication
and
finally
loss
of
movement
in
response
to
painful
stimuli
39
issues
of
practical
concern
include
how
the
level
of
consciousness
can
be
assessed
in
severely
ill
comatose
or
anesthetized
people
and
how
to
treat
conditions
in
which
consciousness
is
impaired
or
disrupted
40
the
degree
or
level
of
consciousness
is
measured
by
standardized
behavior
observation
scales
such
as
the
glasgow
coma
scale
philosophy
of
mind
edit
while
historically
philosophers
have
defended
various
views
on
consciousness
surveys
indicate
that
physicalism
is
now
the
dominant
position
among
contemporary
philosophers
of
mind
41
for
an
overview
of
the
field
approaches
often
include
both
historical
perspectives
e
g
descartes
locke
kant
and
organization
by
key
issues
in
contemporary
debates
an
alternative
is
to
focus
primarily
on
current
philosophical
stances
and
empirical
findings
coherence
of
the
concept
edit
philosophers
differ
from
nonphilosophers
in
their
intuitions
about
what
consciousness
is
42
while
most
people
have
a
strong
intuition
for
the
existence
of
what
they
refer
to
as
consciousness30
skeptics
argue
that
this
intuition
is
too
narrow
either
because
the
concept
of
consciousness
is
embedded
in
our
intuitions
or
because
we
all
are
illusions
gilbert
ryle
for
example
argued
that
traditional
understanding
of
consciousness
depends
on
a
cartesian
dualist
outlook
that
improperly
distinguishes
between
mind
and
body
or
between
mind
and
world
he
proposed
that
we
speak
not
of
minds
bodies
and
the
world
but
of
entities
or
identities
acting
in
the
world
thus
by
speaking
of
consciousness
we
end
up
leading
ourselves
by
thinking
that
there
is
any
sort
of
thing
as
consciousness
separated
from
behavioral
and
linguistic
understandings
43
types
edit
ned
block
argued
that
discussions
on
consciousness
often
failed
to
properly
distinguish
phenomenal
pconsciousness
from
access
aconsciousness
though
these
terms
had
been
used
before
block
44
pconsciousness
according
to
block
is
raw
experience
it
is
moving
colored
forms
sounds
sensations
emotions
and
feelings
with
our
bodies
and
responses
at
the
center
these
experiences
considered
independently
of
any
impact
on
behavior
are
called
qualia
aconsciousness
on
the
other
hand
is
the
phenomenon
whereby
information
in
our
minds
is
accessible
for
verbal
report
reasoning
and
the
control
of
behavior
so
when
we
perceive
information
about
what
we
perceive
is
access
conscious
when
we
introspect
information
about
our
thoughts
is
access
conscious
when
we
remember
information
about
the
past
is
access
conscious
and
so
on
although
some
philosophers
such
as
daniel
dennett
have
disputed
the
validity
of
this
distinction45
others
have
broadly
accepted
it
david
chalmers
has
argued
that
aconsciousness
can
in
principle
be
understood
in
mechanistic
terms
but
that
understanding
pconsciousness
is
much
more
challenging
he
calls
this
the
hard
problem
of
consciousness
46
some
philosophers
believe
that
block
s
two
types
of
consciousness
are
not
the
end
of
the
story
william
lycan
for
example
argued
in
his
book
consciousness
and
experience
that
at
least
eight
clearly
distinct
types
of
consciousness
can
be
identified
organism
consciousness
control
consciousness
consciousness
of
stateevent
consciousness
reportability
introspective
consciousness
subjective
consciousness
selfconsciousness
—
and
that
even
this
list
omits
several
more
obscure
forms
47
there
is
also
debate
over
whether
or
not
aconsciousness
and
pconsciousness
always
coexist
or
if
they
can
exist
separately
although
pconsciousness
without
aconsciousness
is
more
widely
accepted
there
have
been
some
hypothetical
examples
of
a

at

seen

consciousness
is
a

the

come

christopher

argues
that
this
field
of

is
symbolized
by
the

its

the

influential
philosopher
to
discuss
this
question
specifically
was
descartes
and
the
answer
he
gave
is
known
as
mind
–
body
dualism
descartes
proposed
that
consciousness
resides
within
an
immaterial
domain
he
called
res
cogitans
the
realm
of
thought
in
contrast
to
the
domain
of
material
things
which
he
called
res
extensa
the
realm
of
extension
51
he
suggested
that
the
interaction
between
these
two
domains
occurs
inside
the
brain
perhaps
in
a
small
midline
structure
called
the
pineal
gland
52
although
it
is
widely
accepted
that
descartes
explained
the
problem
cogently
few
later
philosophers
have
been
happy
with
his
solution
and
his
ideas
about
the
pineal
gland
have
especially
been
ridiculed
53
however
no
alternative
solution
has
gained
general
acceptance
proposed
solutions
can
be
divided
broadly
into
two
categories
dualist
solutions
that
maintain
descartes
s
rigid
distinction
between
the
realm
of
consciousness
and
the
realm
of
matter
but
give
different
answers
for
how
the
two
realms
relate
to
each
other
and
monist
solutions
that
maintain
that
there
is
really
only
one
realm
of
being
of
which
consciousness
and
matter
are
both
aspects
each
of
these
categories
itself
contains
numerous
variants
the
two
main
types
of
dualism
are
substance
dualism
which
holds
that
the
mind
is
formed
of
a
distinct
type
of
substance
not
governed
by
the
laws
of
physics
and
property
dualism
which
holds
that
the
laws
of
physics
are
universally
valid
but
cannot
be
used
to
explain
the
mind
the
three
main
types
of
monism
are
physicalism
which
holds
that
the
mind
consists
of
matter
organized
in
a
particular
way
idealism
which
holds
that
only
thought
or
experience
truly
exists
and
matter
is
merely
an
illusion
and
neutral
monism
which
holds
that
both
mind
and
matter
are
aspects
of
a
distinct
essence
that
is
itself
identical
to
neither
of
them
there
are
also
however
a
large
number
of
idiosyncratic
theories
that
cannot
cleanly
be
assigned
to
any
of
these
schools
of
thought
54
since
the
dawn
of
newtonian
science
with
its
vision
of
simple
mechanical
principles
governing
the
entire
universe
some
philosophers
have
been
tempted
by
the
idea
that
consciousness
could
be
explained
in
purely
physical
terms
the
first
influential
writer
to
propose
such
an
idea
explicitly
was
julien
offray
de
la
mettrie
in
his
book
man
a
machine
l
homme
machine
his
arguments
however
were
very
abstract
55
the
most
influential
modern
physical
theories
of
consciousness
are
based
on
psychology
and
neuroscience
theories
proposed
by
neuroscientists
such
as
gerald
edelman56
and
antonio
damasio57
and
by
philosophers
such
as
daniel
dennett58
seek
to
explain
consciousness
in
terms
of
neural
events
occurring
within
the
brain
many
other
neuroscientists
such
as
christof
koch59
have
explored
the
neural
basis
of
consciousness
without
attempting
to
frame
allencompassing
global
theories
at
the
same
time
computer
scientists
working
in
the
field
of
artificial
intelligence
have
pursued
the
goal
of
creating
digital
computer
programs
that
can
simulate
or
embody
consciousness
60
a
few
theoretical
physicists
have
argued
that
classical
physics
is
intrinsically
incapable
of
explaining
the
holistic
aspects
of
consciousness
but
that
quantum
theory
may
provide
the
missing
ingredients
several
theorists
have
therefore
proposed
quantum
mind
qm
theories
of
consciousness
61
notable
theories
falling
into
this
category
include
the
holonomic
brain
theory
of
karl
pribram
and
david
bohm
and
the
orchor
theory
formulated
by
stuart
hameroff
and
roger
penrose
some
of
these
qm
theories
offer
descriptions
of
phenomenal
consciousness
as
well
as
qm
interpretations
of
access

none
of
the
quantum
mechanical
theories
have
been
confirmed

falsify
proposals
such
as
those
of
hameroff
which
rely
on
quantum
entanglement
in

at
the
present
time
many
scientists
and
philosophers
consider
the
arguments
for
an
important
role
of
quantum
phenomena
to
be
unconvincing
63
empirical
evidence
is
against
the
notion
of
quantum
consciousness
an
experiment
about
wave
function
collapse
led
by
catalina
curceanu
in
2022
suggests
that
quantum
consciousness
as
suggested
by
roger
penrose
and
stuart
hameroff
is
highly
implausible
64
apart
from
the
general
question
of
the
hard
problem
of
consciousness
which
is
roughly
speaking
the
question
of
how
mental
experience
can
arise
from
a
physical
basis65
a
more
specialized
question
is
how
to
square
the
subjective
notion
that
we
are
in
control
of
our
decisions
at
least
in
some
small
measure
with
the
customary
view
of
causality
that
subsequent
events
are

by
prior

problem
of
other
minds
many
philosophers
consider
experience
to
be
the
essence
of
consciousness
and
believe
that
experience
can
only
fully
be
known
from
the
inside
subjectively
the
problem
of
other
minds
is
a
philosophical
problem
traditionally
stated
as
the
following
epistemological
question
given
that
i
can
only
observe
the
behavior
of
others
how
can
i
know
that
others
have
minds
66
the
problem
of
other
minds
is
particularly
acute
for
people
who
believe
in
the
possibility
of
philosophical
zombies
that
is
people
who
think
it
is
possible
in
principle
to
have
an
entity
that
is
physically
indistinguishable
from
a
human
being
and
behaves
like
a
human
being
in
every
way
but
nevertheless
lacks
consciousness
67
related

have
also
been

extensively
by
greg
littmann

by
colin
allen
a
professor
at
the
university
of
pittsburgh
regarding
the

research
studying
artificial
intelligence
in
androids
69
the
most
commonly
given
answer
is
that
we
attribute
consciousness
to
other
people
because
we
see
that
they
resemble
us
in
appearance
and
behavior
we
reason
that
if
they
look
like
us
and
act
like
us
they
must
be
like
us
in
other
ways
including
having
experiences
of
the
sort
that
we
do
70
there
are
however
a
variety
of
problems
with
that
explanation
for
one
thing
it
seems
to
violate
the
principle
of
parsimony
by
postulating
an
invisible
entity
that
is
not
necessary
to
explain
what
we
observe
70
some
philosophers
such
as
daniel
dennett
in
a
research
paper
titled
the
unimagined
preposterousness
of
zombies
argue
that
people
who
give
this
explanation
do
not
really
understand
what
they
are
saying
71
more
broadly
philosophers
who
do
not
accept
the
possibility
of
zombies
generally
believe
that
consciousness
is
reflected
in
behavior
including
verbal
behavior
and
that
we
attribute
consciousness
on
the
basis
of
behavior
a
more
straightforward
way
of
saying
this
is
that
we
attribute
experiences
to
people
because
of
what
they
can
do
including
the
fact
that
they
can
tell
us
about
their

experimental
research
on
consciousness
presents
special
difficulties
due
to
the
lack
of
a
universally
accepted
operational
definition
in
the
majority
of
experiments
that
are
specifically
about
consciousness
the
subjects
are
human
and
the
criterion
used
is
verbal
report
in
other
words
subjects
are
asked
to
describe
their
experiences
and
their
descriptions
are
treated
as
observations
of
the
contents
of
consciousness
82
for
example
subjects
who
stare
continuously
at
a
necker
cube
usually
report
that
they
experience
it
flipping
between
two
3d
configurations
even
though
the
stimulus
itself
remains
the
same
83
the
objective
is
to
understand
the
relationship
between
the
conscious
awareness
of
stimuli
as
indicated
by
verbal
report
and
the
effects
the
stimuli
have
on
brain
activity
and
behavior
in
several
paradigms
such
as
the
technique
of
response
priming
the
behavior
of
subjects
is
clearly
influenced
by
stimuli
for
which
they
report
no
awareness
and
suitable
experimental
manipulations
can
lead
to
increasing
priming
effects
despite
decreasing

double
dissociation
84
verbal
report
is
widely
considered
to
be
the
most
reliable
indicator
of
consciousness
but
it
raises
a
number
of
issues
85
for
one
thing
if
verbal
reports
are
treated
as
observations
akin
to
observations
in
other
branches
of
science
then
the
possibility
arises
that
they
may
contain
errors
—
but
it
is
difficult
to
make
sense
of
the
idea
that
subjects
could
be
wrong
about
their
own
experiences
and
even
more
difficult
to
see
how
such
an
error
could
be
detected
86
daniel
dennett
has
argued
for
an
approach
he
calls
heterophenomenology
which
means
treating
verbal
reports
as
stories
that
may
or
may
not
be
true
but
his
ideas
about
how
to
do
this
have
not
been
widely
adopted
87
another
issue
with
verbal
report
as
a
criterion
is
that
it
restricts
the
field
of
study
to
humans
who
have
language
this
approach
cannot
be
used
to
study
consciousness
in
other
species
prelinguistic
children
or
people
with
types
of
brain
damage
that
impair
language
as
a
third
issue
philosophers
who
dispute
the
validity
of
the
turing
test
may
feel
that
it
is
possible
at
least
in
principle
for
verbal
report
to
be
dissociated
from
consciousness
entirely
a
philosophical
zombie
may
give
detailed
verbal
reports
of
awareness
in
the
absence
of
any
genuine
awareness
88
although
verbal
report
is
in
practice
the
gold
standard
for
ascribing
consciousness
it
is
not
the
only
possible
criterion
85
in
medicine
consciousness
is
assessed
as
a
combination
of
verbal
behavior
arousal
brain
activity
and
purposeful
movement
the
last
three
of
these
can
be
used
as
indicators
of
consciousness
when
verbal
behavior
is
absent
8990
the
scientific
literature
regarding
the
neural
bases
of
arousal
and
purposeful
movement
is
very
extensive
their
reliability
as
indicators
of
consciousness
is
disputed
however
due
to
numerous
studies
showing
that
alert
human
subjects
can
be
induced
to
behave
purposefully
in
a
variety
of
ways
in
spite
of
reporting
a
complete
lack
of
awareness
84
studies
related
to
the
neuroscience

have
also

that
the
influence
consciousness
has

1970s
gordon
gallup
developed
an
operational
test
for
selfawareness
known
as
the
mirror
test
the
test
examines
whether
animals
are
able
to
differentiate
between
seeing
themselves
in
a
mirror
versus
seeing
other
animals
the
classic
example
involves
placing
a
spot
of
coloring
on
the
skin
or
fur
near
the
individual
s
forehead
and
seeing
if
they
attempt
to
remove
it
or
at
least
touch
the
spot
thus
indicating
that
they
recognize
that
the
individual
they

in

—
that
is
studies
of
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
the
hope
is
to
find
that
activity
in
a
particular
part
of
the
brain
or
a
particular
pattern
of
global
brain
activity
which
will
be
strongly
predictive
of
conscious
awareness
several
brain
imaging
techniques
such
as
eeg
and
fmri
have
been
used
for
physical
measures
of
brain
activity
in
these
studies
97
another
idea
that
has
drawn
attention
for
several
decades
is
that
consciousness
is
associated
with
highfrequency
gamma
band
oscillations
in
brain
activity
this
idea
arose
from
proposals
in
the
1980s
by
christof
von
der
malsburg
and
wolf
singer
that
gamma
oscillations
could
solve
the
socalled
binding
problem
by
linking
information
represented
in
different
parts
of
the
brain
into
a
unified
experience
98
rodolfo
llinás
for
example
proposed
that
consciousness
results
from
recurrent
thalamocortical
resonance
where
the
specific
thalamocortical
systems
content
and
the
nonspecific
centromedial
thalamus
thalamocortical
systems
context
interact
in
the
gamma
band
frequency
via
synchronous
oscillations
99
a
number
of
studies
have
shown
that
activity
in
primary
sensory
areas
of
the
brain
is
not
sufficient
to
produce
consciousness
it
is
possible
for
subjects
to
report
a
lack
of
awareness
even
when
areas
such
as
the
primary
visual
cortex
v1
show
clear
electrical
responses
to
a
stimulus
100
higher
brain
areas
are
seen
as
more
promising
especially
the
prefrontal
cortex
which
is
involved
in
a
range
of
higher
cognitive
functions
collectively
known
as
executive
functions
101
there
is
substantial
evidence
that
a
topdown
flow
of
neural
activity
i
e
activity
propagating
from
the
frontal
cortex
to
sensory
areas
is
more
predictive
of
conscious
awareness
than
a
bottomup
flow
of
activity
102
the
prefrontal
cortex
is
not
the
only
candidate
area
however
studies
by
nikos
logothetis
and
his
colleagues
have
shown
for
example
that
visually
responsive
neurons
in
parts
of
the
temporal
lobe
reflect
the
visual
perception
in
the
situation
when
conflicting
visual
images
are
presented
to
different
eyes
i
e
bistable
percepts
during
binocular
rivalry
103
furthermore
topdown
feedback
from
higher
to
lower
visual
brain
areas
may
be
weaker
or
absent
in
the
peripheral
visual
field
as
suggested
by
some
experimental
data
and
theoretical
arguments104
nevertheless
humans
can
perceive
visual
inputs
in
the
peripheral
visual
field
arising
from
bottomup
v1
neural
activities
104105
meanwhile
bottomup
v1
activities
for
the
central
visual
fields
can
be
vetoed
and
thus
made
invisible
to
perception
by
the
topdown
feedback
when
these
bottomup
signals
are
inconsistent
with
the
brain
s
internal
model
of
the
visual
world
104105
modulation
of
neural
responses
may
correlate
with
phenomenal
experiences
in
contrast
to
the
raw
electrical
responses
that
do
not
correlate
with
consciousness
the
modulation
of
these
responses
by
other
stimuli
correlates
surprisingly
well
with
an
important
aspect
of
consciousness
namely
with
the
phenomenal
experience
of
stimulus
intensity
brightness
contrast
in
the
research
group
of
danko
nikolić
it
has
been
shown
that
some
of
the
changes
in
the
subjectively
perceived
brightness
correlated
with
the
modulation
of
firing
rates
while
others
correlated
with
the
modulation
of
neural
synchrony
106
an
fmri
investigation
suggested
that
these
findings
were
strictly
limited
to
the
primary
visual
areas
107
this
indicates
that
in
the
primary
visual
areas
changes
in
firing
rates
and
synchrony
can
be
considered
as
neural
correlates
of
qualia
—
at
least
for
some
type
of
qualia
in
2013
the
perturbational
complexity
index
pci
was
proposed
a
measure
of
the
algorithmic
complexity
of
the
electrophysiological
response
of
the
cortex
to
transcranial
magnetic
stimulation
this
measure
was
shown
to
be
higher
in
individuals
that
are
awake
in
rem
sleep
or
in
a
lockedin
state
than
in
those
who
are
in
deep
sleep
or
in
a
vegetative
state108
making
it
potentially
useful
as
a
quantitative
assessment
of
consciousness
states
assuming
that
not
only
humans
but
even
some
nonmammalian
species
are
conscious
a
number
of
evolutionary
approaches
to
the
problem
of
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
open
up
for
example
assuming
that
birds
are
conscious
—
a
common
assumption
among
neuroscientists
and
ethologists
due
to
the
extensive
cognitive
repertoire
of
birds
—
there
are
comparative
neuroanatomical
ways
to
validate
some
of
the
principal
currently
competing
mammalian
consciousness
–
brain
theories
the
rationale
for
such
a
comparative
study
is
that
the
avian
brain
deviates
structurally
from
the
mammalian
brain
so
how
similar
are
they
what
homologs
can
be
identified
the
general
conclusion
from
the
study
by
butler
et
al
109
is
that
some
of
the
major
theories
for
the
mammalian
brain110111112
also
appear
to
be
valid
for
the
avian
brain
the
structures
assumed
to
be
critical
for
consciousness
in
mammalian
brains
have
homologous
counterparts
in
avian
brains
thus
the
main
portions
of
the
theories
of
crick
and
koch110
edelman
and
tononi111
and
cotterill
112
seem
to
be
compatible
with
the
assumption
that
birds
are
conscious
edelman
also
differentiates
between
what
he
calls
primary
consciousness
which
is
a
trait
shared
by
humans
and
nonhuman
animals
and
higherorder
consciousness
as
it
appears
in
humans
alone
along
with
human
language
capacity
111
certain
aspects
of
the
three
theories
however
seem
less
easy
to
apply
to
the
hypothesis
of
avian
consciousness
for
instance
the
suggestion
by
crick
and
koch
that
layer
5
neurons
of
the
mammalian
brain
have
a
special
role
seems
difficult
to
apply
to
the
avian
brain
since
the
avian
homologs
have
a
different
morphology
likewise
the
theory
of
eccles113114
seems
incompatible
since
a
structural
homologanalogue
to
the
dendron
has
not
been
found
in
avian
brains
the
assumption
of
an
avian
consciousness
also
brings
the
reptilian
brain
into
focus
the
reason
is
the
structural
continuity
between
avian
and
reptilian
brains
meaning
that
the
phylogenetic
origin
of
consciousness
may
be
earlier
than
suggested
by
many
leading
neuroscientists
joaquin
fuster

has
advocated
the
position
of
the
importance
of
the
prefrontal
cortex
in

as
being

claustrum

a
proposal

francis
crick
codiscoverer
of
the
double
helix
which
stated
that
to

a

proposed

collate

the
duo
reckoned
that
the
claustrum
was
well

idea
73
the
proposal

biological

the
emergence

ongoing

inquiry
the
survival

is
still
a
matter
of
exploration
and
understanding
while
consciousness
appears
to
play
a
crucial
role
in

decisionmaking

its

across

question
whether

argue

that

its

an
epiphenomenalist
theory
of

according
to
which
consciousness
is
a
causally
inert
effect
of
neural
activity
—
as
the

which

this
william

interaction
implying
that
if
the
preservation

development
of
consciousness
in
the
biological
evolution
is
a
result
of

selection
it
is
plausible
that
consciousness

has

itself

it

further
exploration
of
the

in

139
regarding
the
primary
function
of
conscious
processing
a
recurring
idea
in
recent
theories
is
that
phenomenal
states
somehow
integrate
neural
activities
and
informationprocessing
that
would
otherwise
be
independent
140
this
has
been
called
the
integration
consensus
another
example
has
been
proposed
by
gerald
edelman
called
dynamic
core
hypothesis
which
puts
emphasis
on
reentrant
connections
that
reciprocally
link
areas
of
the
brain
in
a
massively
parallel
manner
141
edelman
also
stresses
the
importance
of
the
evolutionary
emergence
of
higherorder
consciousness
in
humans
from
the
historically
older
trait
of
primary
consciousness
which
humans
share
with
nonhuman
animals
see
neural
correlates
section
above
these
theories
of
integrative
function
present
solutions
to
two
classic
problems
associated
with
consciousness
differentiation
and
unity
they
show
how
our
conscious
experience
can
discriminate
between
a
virtually
unlimited
number
of
different
possible
scenes
and
details
differentiation
because
it
integrates
those
details
from
our
sensory
systems
while
the
integrative
nature
of
consciousness
in
this
view
easily
explains
how
our
experience
can
seem
unified
as
one
whole
despite
all
of
these
individual
parts
however
it
remains
unspecified
which
kinds
of
information
are
integrated
in
a
conscious
manner
and
which
kinds
can
be
integrated
without
consciousness
nor
is
it
explained
what
specific
causal
role
conscious
integration
plays
nor
why
the
same
functionality
cannot
be
achieved
without
consciousness
not
all
kinds
of
information
are
capable
of
being
disseminated
consciously
e
g
neural
activity
related
to
vegetative
functions
reflexes
unconscious
motor
programs
lowlevel
perceptual
analyzes
etc
and
many
kinds
of
information
can
be
disseminated
and
combined
with
other
kinds
without
consciousness
as
in
intersensory
interactions
such
as
the
ventriloquism
effect
142
hence
it
remains
unclear
why
any
of
it
is
conscious

review
of
the
differences

conscious
and
unconscious
integrations

article

as
noted
earlier
even
among
writers
who
consider
consciousness
to

welldefined
there
is
widespread
dispute
about
which
animals
other
than

can
be
said
to

described
this
distinction
as
that
of
humans
possessing
higherorder
consciousness
while
sharing
the
trait
of
primary
consciousness
with
nonhuman
animals
see
previous
paragraph
thus
any
examination
of
the
evolution
of
consciousness
is
faced
with
great
difficulties
nevertheless
some
writers
have
argued
that
consciousness
can
be
viewed
from
the
standpoint
of
evolutionary
biology
as
an
adaptation
in
the
sense
of
a
trait
that
increases
fitness
144
in
his
article
evolution
of
consciousness
john
eccles
argued
that
special
anatomical
and
physical
properties
of
the
mammalian
cerebral
cortex
gave
rise
to
consciousness
a
psychon
linked
to
a
dendron
through
quantum
physics
145
bernard
baars
proposed
that
once
in
place
this
recursive
circuitry
may
have
provided
a
basis
for
the
subsequent
development
of
many
of
the
functions
that
consciousness
facilitates
in
higher
organisms
146
peter
carruthers
has
put
forth
one
such
potential
adaptive
advantage
gained
by
conscious
creatures
by
suggesting
that
consciousness
allows
an
individual
to
make
distinctions
between
appearance
and
reality
147
this
ability
would
enable
a
creature
to
recognize
the
likelihood
that
their
perceptions
are
deceiving
them
e
g
that
water
in
the
distance
may
be
a
mirage
and
behave
accordingly
and
it
could
also
facilitate
the
manipulation
of
others
by
recognizing
how
things
appear
to
them
for
both
cooperative
and
devious
ends
other
philosophers
however
have
suggested
that
consciousness
would
not
be
necessary
for
any
functional
advantage
in
evolutionary
processes
148149
no
one
has
given
a
causal
explanation
they
argue
of
why
it
would
not
be
possible
for
a
functionally
equivalent
nonconscious
organism
i
e
a
philosophical
zombie
to
achieve
the
very
same
survival
advantages
as
a
conscious
organism
if
evolutionary
processes
are
blind
to
the
difference
between
function
f
being
performed
by
conscious
organism
o
and
nonconscious
organism
o
it
is
unclear
what
adaptive
advantage
consciousness
could
provide
150
as
a
result
an
exaptive
explanation
of
consciousness
has
gained
favor
with
some
theorists
that
posit
consciousness
did
not
evolve
as
an
adaptation
but
was
an
exaptation
arising
as
a
consequence
of
other
developments
such
as
increases
in
brain
size
or
cortical
rearrangement
137
consciousness
in
this
sense
has
been
compared
to
the
blind
spot
in
the
retina
where
it
is
not
an
adaption
of
the
retina
but
instead
just
a
byproduct
of
the
way
the
retinal
axons
were
wired
151
several
scholars
including
pinker
chomsky
edelman
and
luria
have
indicated
the
importance
of
the
emergence
of
human
language
as
an
important
regulative
mechanism
of
learning
and
memory
in
the
context
of
the

altered
state
of
consciousness
there
are
some
brain
states
in
which
consciousness
seems
to
be
absent
including
dreamless
sleep
or
coma
there
are
also
a
variety
of
circumstances
that
can
change
the
relationship
between
the
mind
and
the
world
in
less
drastic
ways
producing
what
are
known
as
altered
states
of
consciousness
some
altered
states
occur
naturally
others
can
be
produced
by
drugs
or
brain
damage
152
altered
states
can
be
accompanied
by
changes
in

feelings

153
the
two
most
widely
accepted
altered

are
sleep
and
dreaming
although
dream
sleep
and

appear
very
similar

each
is

people

these

even
describe

underlying
these

are
not
as
well
understood
as
those
induced
by

there
is
substantial

has
reported

whether

the

the
medical
approach
to

people
whose

impaired
as
a

of

toxins
or

in
medicine
conceptual
distinctions
are
considered
useful
to
the
degree
that
they
can
help
to
guide
treatments
the
medical
approach
focuses
mostly
on
the
amount
of
consciousness
a
person
has
in
medicine
consciousness
is
assessed
as
a
level
ranging
from
coma
and
brain
death
at
the
low
end
to
full

and
purposeful
responsiveness
at
the
high

163
consciousness
is
of
concern
to
patients
and
physicians
especially
neurologists
and
anesthesiologists
patients
may
have
disorders
of

may
need
to
be

physicians
may
perform

interventions

as

administering

assessment
edit
in
medicine
consciousness
is
examined
using
a
set
of
procedures
known
as
neuropsychological
assessment
89
there
are
two
commonly
used
methods
for
assessing
the
level
of
consciousness
of
a
patient
a
simple
procedure
that
requires
minimal
training
and
a
more
complex
procedure
that
requires
substantial
expertise
the
simple
procedure
begins
by
asking
whether
the
patient
is
able
to
move
and
react
to
physical
stimuli
if
so
the
next
question
is
whether
the
patient
can
respond
in
a
meaningful
way
to
questions
and
commands
if
so
the
patient
is
asked
for
name
current
location
and
current
day
and
time
a
patient
who
can
answer
all
of
these
questions
is
said
to
be
alert
and
oriented
times
four
sometimes
denoted
aox4
on
a
medical
chart
and
is
usually
considered
fully
conscious
166
the
more
complex
procedure
is
known
as
a
neurological
examination
and
is
usually
carried
out
by
a
neurologist
in
a
hospital
setting
a
formal
neurological
examination
runs
through
a
precisely
delineated
series
of
tests
beginning
with
tests
for
basic
sensorimotor
reflexes
and
culminating
with
tests
for
sophisticated
use
of
language
the
outcome
may
be
summarized
using
the
glasgow
coma
scale
which
yields
a
number
in
the
range
3
–
15
with
a
score
of
3
to
8
indicating
coma
and
15
indicating
full
consciousness
the
glasgow
coma
scale
has
three
subscales
measuring
the
best
motor
response
ranging
from
no
motor
response
to
obeys
commands
the
best
eye
response
ranging
from
no
eye
opening
to
eyes
opening
spontaneously
and
the
best
verbal
response
ranging
from
no
verbal
response
to
fully
oriented
there
is
also
a
simpler
pediatric
version
of
the
scale
for
children
too
young
to
be
able
to
use
language
163
in
2013
an
experimental
procedure
was
developed
to
measure
degrees
of
consciousness
the
procedure
involving
stimulating
the
brain
with
a
magnetic
pulse
measuring
resulting
waves
of
electrical
activity
and
developing
a
consciousness

173
anosognosia
is
a
greekderived
term
meaning
unawareness
of
disease
this
is
a
condition
in
which
patients
are
disabled
in
some
way
most
commonly
as
a
result
of
a
stroke
but
either
misunderstand

174
the
most
frequently
occurring
form
is
seen
in
people
who
have
experienced
a
stroke
damaging
the
parietal
lobe
in
the
right
hemisphere
of
the
brain
giving
rise
to
a
syndrome
known
as
hemispatial
neglect
characterized
by
an
inability
to
direct
action
or
attention
toward
objects
located
to
the
left
with
respect
to
their

patients
with
hemispatial

are
often
paralyzed
on

side
of
the
body
but
sometimes
deny
being
unable
to
move
when
questioned
about
the
obvious
problem
the
patient
may
avoid
giving
a
direct
answer
or
may
give
an
explanation
that

make
sense
patients
with
hemispatial

may
also
fail
to
recognize
paralyzed
parts
of

one
frequently

animal
consciousness
the
topic
of
animal
consciousness
is
beset
by
a
number
of
difficulties
it
poses
the
problem
of
other
minds
in
an
especially
severe
form
because
nonhuman
animals
lacking
the
ability
to
express
human
language
cannot
tell
humans
about
their
experiences
182
also
it
is
difficult
to
reason
objectively
about
the
question
because
a
denial
that
an
animal
is
conscious
is
often
taken
to
imply
that
it
does
not
feel
its
life
has
no
value
and
that
harming
it
is
not
morally
wrong
descartes
for
example
has
sometimes
been
blamed
for
mistreatment
of
animals
due
to
the
fact
that
he
believed
only
humans
have
a
nonphysical
mind
183
most
people
have
a
strong
intuition
that
some
animals
such
as
cats
and
dogs
are
conscious
while
others
such
as
insects
are
not
but
the
sources
of
this
intuition
are
not
obvious
and
are
often
based

personal
interactions

other
animals

thomas

imagine
what
it
is

by
taking

generally
believe
as

that
the
existence

nature
of
animal
consciousness
can
never
rigorously
be
known
thomas
nagel
spelled
out
this
point
of
view
in
an
influential
essay
titled
what
is
it
like
to
be
a
bat
he
said
that
an
organism
is
conscious
if
and
only
if
there
is
something
that
it
is
like
to
be
that
organism
—
something
it
is
like
for
the
organism
and
he
argued
that
no
matter
how
much
we
know
about
an
animal
s
brain
and
behavior
we
can
never
really
put
ourselves
into
the
mind
of
the
animal
and
experience
its
world
in
the
way
it
does
itself
184
other
thinkers

as
douglas

dismiss
this
argument
as
incoherent

several

ethologists
have
argued
for
the
existence
of
animal
consciousness
by
describing
a
range
of
behaviors
that
appear
to
show
animals
holding
beliefs
about
things
they
cannot
directly
perceive

eminent
scientists
from
different
branches
of
neuroscience
gathered
at
the
university
of
cambridge
to
celebrate
the
francis
crick
memorial
conference
which
deals
with
consciousness
in
humans
and
prelinguistic
consciousness
in
nonhuman
animals
after
the
conference
they
signed
in
the
presence
of
stephen
hawking
the
cambridge
declaration
on
consciousness
which
summarizes
the
most
important
findings
of
the
survey
we
decided
to
reach
a
consensus
and
make
a
statement
directed
to
the
public
that
is
not
scientific
it
s
obvious
to
everyone
in
this
room
that
animals
have
consciousness
but
it
is
not
obvious
to
the
rest
of
the
world
it
is
not
obvious
to
the
rest
of
the
western
world
or
the
far
east
it
is
not
obvious
to
the
society
186
convergent
evidence
indicates
that
nonhuman
animals
including
all
mammals
and
birds
and
other
creatures
have
the
necessary
neural
substrates
of
consciousness
and
the
capacity
to
exhibit
intentional
behaviors

artificial
consciousness
the
idea
of
an
artifact
made
conscious
is
an
ancient
theme
of
mythology
appearing
for
example
in
the
greek
myth
of
pygmalion
who
carved
a
statue
that
was
magically
brought
to
life
and
in
medieval
jewish
stories
of
the
golem
a
magically
animated
homunculus
built
of
clay
188
however
the
possibility
of
actually
constructing
a
conscious
machine
was
probably
first
discussed
by
ada
lovelace
in
a
set
of
notes
written
in
1842
about
the
analytical
engine
invented
by
charles
babbage
a
precursor
never
built
to
modern
electronic
computers
lovelace
was
essentially
dismissive
of
the
idea
that
a
machine
such
as
the
analytical
engine
could
think
in
a
humanlike
way
she
wrote
it
is
desirable
to
guard
against
the
possibility
of
exaggerated
ideas
that
might
arise
as
to
the
powers
of
the
analytical
engine
 
the
analytical
engine
has
no
pretensions
whatever
to
originate
anything
it
can
do
whatever
we
know
how
to
order
it
to
perform
it
can
follow
analysis
but
it
has
no
power
of
anticipating
any
analytical
relations
or
truths
its
province
is
to
assist
us
in
making
available
what
we
are
already
acquainted
with
189
one
of
the
most
influential
contributions
to
this
question
was
an
essay
written
in
1950
by
pioneering
computer
scientist
alan
turing
titled
computing
machinery
and
intelligence
turing
disavowed
any
interest
in
terminology
saying
that
even
can
machines
think
is
too
loaded
with
spurious
connotations
to
be
meaningful
but
he
proposed
to
replace
all
such
questions
with
a
specific
operational
test
which
has
become
known
as
the
turing
test
190
to
pass
the
test
a
computer
must
be
able
to
imitate
a
human
well
enough
to
fool
interrogators
in
his
essay
turing
discussed
a
variety
of
possible
objections
and
presented
a
counterargument
to
each
of
them
the
turing
test
is
commonly
cited
in
discussions
of
artificial
intelligence
as
a
proposed
criterion
for
machine
consciousness
it
has
provoked
a
great
deal
of
philosophical
debate
for
example
daniel
dennett
and
douglas
hofstadter
argue
that
anything
capable
of
passing
the
turing
test
is
necessarily
conscious191
while
david
chalmers
argues
that
a
philosophical
zombie
could
pass
the
test
yet
fail
to
be
conscious
192
a
third
group
of
scholars
have
argued
that
with
technological
growth
once
machines
begin
to
display
any
substantial
signs
of
humanlike
behavior
then
the
dichotomy
of
human
consciousness
compared
to
humanlike
consciousness
becomes
passé
and
issues
of
machine
autonomy
begin
to
prevail
even
as
observed
in
its
nascent
form
within
contemporary
industry
and
technology
6869
jürgen
schmidhuber
argues
that
consciousness
is
the
result
of
compression
193
as
an
agent
sees
representation
of
itself
recurring
in
the
environment
the
compression
of
this
representation
can
be
called
consciousness
john
searle
in
december
2005
in
a
lively
exchange
over
what
has
come
to
be
referred
to
as
the
chinese
room
argument
john
searle
sought
to
refute
the
claim
of
proponents
of
what
he
calls
strong
artificial
intelligence
ai
that
a
computer
program
can
be
conscious
though
he
does
agree
with
advocates
of
weak
ai
that
computer
programs
can
be
formatted
to
simulate
conscious
states
his
own
view
is
that
consciousness
has
subjective
firstperson
causal
powers
by
being
essentially
intentional
due
to
the
way
human
brains
function
biologically
conscious
persons
can
perform
computations
but
consciousness
is
not
inherently
computational
the
way
computer
programs
are
to
make
a
turing
machine
that
speaks
chinese
searle
imagines
a
room
with
one
monolingual
english
speaker
searle
himself
in
fact
a
book
that
designates
a
combination
of
chinese
symbols
to
be
output
paired
with
chinese
symbol
input
and
boxes
filled
with
chinese
symbols
in
this
case
the
english
speaker
is
acting
as
a
computer
and
the
rulebook
as
a
program
searle
argues
that
with
such
a
machine
he
would
be
able
to
process
the
inputs
to
outputs
perfectly
without
having
any
understanding
of
chinese
nor
having
any
idea
what
the
questions
and
answers
could
possibly
mean
if
the
experiment
were
done
in
english
since
searle
knows
english
he
would
be
able
to
take
questions
and
give
answers
without
any
algorithms
for
english
questions
and
he
would
be
effectively
aware
of
what
was
being
said
and
the
purposes
it
might
serve
searle
would
pass
the
turing
test
of
answering
the
questions
in
both
languages
but
he
is
only
conscious
of
what
he
is
doing
when
he
speaks
english
another
way
of
putting
the
argument
is
to
say
that
computer
programs
can
pass
the
turing
test
for
processing
the
syntax
of
a
language
but
that
the
syntax
cannot
lead
to
semantic
meaning
in
the
way
strong
ai
advocates
hoped
194195
in
the
literature
concerning
artificial
intelligence
searle
s
essay
has
been
second
only
to
turing
s
in
the
volume
of
debate
it
has
generated
196
searle
himself
was
vague
about
what
extra
ingredients
it
would
take
to
make
a
machine
conscious
all
he
proposed
was
that
what
was
needed
was
causal
powers
of
the
sort
that
the
brain
has
and
that
computers
lack
but
other
thinkers
sympathetic
to
his
basic
argument
have
suggested
that
the
necessary
though
perhaps
still
not
sufficient
extra
conditions
may
include
the
ability
to
pass
not
just
the
verbal
version
of
the
turing
test
but
the
robotic
version197
which
requires
grounding
the
robot
s
words
in
the
robot
s
sensorimotor
capacity
to
categorize
and
interact
with
the
things
in
the
world

its
words
are
about

victor
argonov
has
suggested
a
nonturing
test
for
machine
consciousness
based
on
a
machine
s
ability
to
produce
philosophical
judgments
199
he
argues
that
a
deterministic
machine
must
be
regarded
as
conscious
if
it
is
able
to
produce
judgments
on
all
problematic
properties
of
consciousness
such
as
qualia
or
binding
having
no
innate
preloaded
philosophical
knowledge
on
these
issues
no
philosophical
discussions
while
learning
and
no
informational
models
of
other
creatures
in
its
memory
such
models
may
implicitly
or
explicitly
contain
knowledge
about
these
creatures
consciousness
however
this
test
can
be
used
only
to
detect
but
not
refute
the
existence
of
consciousness
a
positive
result
proves
that
a
machine
is
conscious
but
a
negative
result
proves
nothing
for
example
absence
of
philosophical
judgments
may
be
caused
by
lack
of
the
machine
s
intellect
not
by
absence
of
consciousness

stream
of
consciousness
psychology
william
james
is
usually
credited
with
popularizing
the
idea
that
human
consciousness
flows
like
a
stream
in
his
principles
of
psychology
of
1890
according
to
james
the
stream
of
thought
is
governed
by
five
characteristics200
1
every
thought
tends
to
be
part
of
a
personal
consciousness
2
within
each
personal
consciousness
thought
is
always
changing
3
within
each
personal
consciousness
thought
is
sensibly
continuous
4
it
always
appears
to
deal
with
objects
independent
of
itself
5
it
is
interested
in
some
parts
of
these
objects
to
the
exclusion
of
others
a
similar
concept
appears
in
buddhist
philosophy
expressed
by
the
sanskrit
term
cittasaṃtāna
which
is
usually
translated
as
mindstream
or
mental
continuum
buddhist
teachings
describe
that
consciousness
manifests
moment
to
moment
as
sense
impressions
and
mental
phenomena
that
are
continuously
changing
201
the
teachings
list
six
triggers
that
can
result
in
the
generation
of
different
mental
events
201
these
triggers
are
input
from
the
five
senses
seeing
hearing
smelling
tasting
or
touch
sensations
or
a
thought
relating
to
the
past
present
or
the
future
that
happen
to
arise
in
the
mind
the
mental
events
generated
as
a
result
of
these
triggers
are
feelings
perceptions
and
intentionsbehaviour
the
momentbymoment
manifestation
of
the
mindstream
is
said
to
happen
in
every
person
all
the
time
it
even
happens
in
a
scientist
who
analyzes
various
phenomena
in
the
world
or
analyzes
the
material
body
including
the
organ
brain
201
the
manifestation
of
the
mindstream
is
also
described
as
being
influenced
by
physical
laws
biological
laws
psychological
laws
volitional
laws
and
universal
laws
201
the
purpose
of
the
buddhist
practice
of
mindfulness
is
to
understand
the
inherent
nature
of
the
consciousness
and
its
characteristics

narrative
form
edit
in

west
the
primary
impact
of
the
idea
has
been
on
literature
rather
than
science
stream
of
consciousness
as
a
narrative
mode
means
writing
in
a
way
that
attempts
to
portray
the
momenttomoment
thoughts
and
experiences
of
a
character
this
technique
perhaps
had
its
beginnings
in
the
monologues
of
shakespeare
s
plays
and
reached
its
fullest
development
in
the
novels
of
james
joyce
and
virginia
woolf
although
it
has
also
been
used
by
many
other
noted
writers

s

perhaps
no
aspect
of
mind
is
more
familiar
or
more
puzzling
than
consciousness
and
our
conscious
experience
of
self
and
world
the
problem
of
consciousness
is
arguably
the
central
issue
in
current
theorizing
about
the
mind
despite
the
lack
of
any
agreed
upon
theory
of
consciousness
there
is
a
widespread
if
less
than
universal
consensus
that
an
adequate
account
of
mind
requires
a
clear
understanding
of
it
and
its
place
in
nature
we
need
to
understand
both
what
consciousness
is
and
how
it
relates
to
other
nonconscious
aspects
of
reality

history
of
the
issue
questions
about
the
nature
of
conscious
awareness
have
likely
been
asked
for
as
long
as
there
have
been
humans
neolithic
burial
practices
appear
to
express
spiritual
beliefs
and
provide
early
evidence
for
at
least
minimally
reflective
thought
about
the
nature
of
human
consciousness
pearson
1999
clark
and
rielsalvatore
2001
preliterate
cultures
have
similarly
been
found
invariably
to
embrace
some
form
of
spiritual
or
at
least
animist
view
that
indicates
a
degree
of
reflection
about
the
nature
of
conscious
awareness
nonetheless
some
have
argued
that
consciousness
as
we
know
it
today
is
a
relatively
recent
historical
development
that
arose
sometime
after
the
homeric
era
jaynes
1974
according
to
this
view
earlier
humans
including
those
who
fought
the
trojan
war
did
not
experience
themselves
as
unified
internal
subjects
of
their
thoughts
and
actions
at
least
not
in
the
ways
we
do
today
others
have
claimed
that
even
during
the
classical
period
there
was
no
word
of
ancient
greek
that
corresponds
to
“
consciousness
”
wilkes
1984
1988
1995
though
the
ancients
had
much
to
say
about
mental
matters
it
is
less
clear
whether
they
had
any
specific
concepts
or
concerns
for
what
we
now
think
of
as
consciousness
although
the
words
“
conscious
”
and
“
conscience
”
are
used
quite
differently
today
it
is
likely
that
the
reformation
emphasis
on
the
latter
as
an
inner
source
of
truth
played
some
role
in
the
inward
turn
so
characteristic
of
the
modern
reflective
view
of
self
the
hamlet
who
walked
the
stage
in
1600
already
saw
his
world
and
self
with
profoundly
modern
eyes
by
the
beginning
of
the
early
modern
era
in
the
seventeenth
century
consciousness
had
come
full
center
in
thinking
about
the
mind
indeed
from
the
mid17th
through
the
late
19th
century
consciousness
was
widely
regarded
as
essential
or
definitive
of
the
mental
rené
descartes
defined
the
very
notion
of
thought
pensée
in
terms
of
reflexive
consciousness
or
selfawareness
in
the
principles
of
philosophy
1640
he
wrote
by
the
word
thought
pensée
i
understand
all
that
of
which
we
are
conscious
as
operating
in
us
later
toward
the
end
of
the
17th
century
john
locke
offered
a
similar
if
slightly
more
qualified
claim
in
an
essay
on
human
understanding
1688
i
do
not
say
there
is
no
soul
in
man
because
he
is
not
sensible
of
it
in
his
sleep
but
i
do
say
he
can
not
think
at
any
time
waking
or
sleeping
without
being
sensible
of
it
our
being
sensible
of
it
is
not
necessary
to
anything
but
our
thoughts
and
to
them
it
is
and
to
them
it
always
will
be
necessary
locke
explicitly
forswore
making
any
hypothesis
about
the
substantial
basis
of
consciousness
and
its
relation
to
matter
but
he
clearly
regarded
it
as
essential
to
thought
as
well
as
to
personal
identity
locke
s
contemporary
g
w
leibniz
drawing
possible
inspiration
from
his
mathematical
work
on
differentiation
and
integration
offered
a
theory
of
mind
in
the
discourse
on
metaphysics
1686
that
allowed
for
infinitely
many
degrees
of
consciousness
and
perhaps
even
for
some
thoughts
that
were
unconscious
the
so
called
“
petites
perceptions
”
leibniz
was
the
first
to
distinguish
explicitly
between
perception
and
apperception
i
e
roughly
between
awareness
and
selfawareness
in
the
monadology
1720
he
also
offered
his
famous
analogy
of
the
mill
to
express
his
belief
that
consciousness
could
not
arise
from
mere
matter
he
asked
his
reader
to
imagine
someone
walking
through
an
expanded
brain
as
one
would

s
recognition
of

for
most
of
the
next
two
centuries
the
domains
of
thought
and
consciousness
were
regarded
as
more
or
less
the
same
associationist
psychology
whether
pursued
by
locke

in

century
by

in

principles
by

thoughts
or
ideas
interacted
or
affected

other
james
mill
s
son
john
stuart
mill
continued
his
father
s
work
on
associationist
psychology
but
he
allowed
that
combinations
of
ideas
might
produce
resultants
that
went
beyond
their
constituent
mental
parts
thus
providing
an
early
model
of
mental
emergence
1865
the
purely
associationist
approach
was
critiqued
in
the
late
eighteenth
century
by
immanuel
kant
1787
who
argued
that
an
adequate
account
of
experience
and
phenomenal
consciousness
required
a
far
richer
structure
of
mental
and
intentional
organization
phenomenal
consciousness
according
to
kant
could
not
be
a
mere
succession
of
associated
ideas
but
at
a
minimum
had
to
be
the
experience
of
a
conscious
self
situated
in
an
objective
world
structured
with
respect
to
space
time
and
causality
within
the
angloamerican
world
associationist
approaches
continued
to
be
influential
in
both
philosophy
and
psychology
well
into
the
twentieth
century
while
in
the
german
and
european
sphere
there
was
a
greater
interest
in
the
larger
structure
of
experience
that
led
in
part
to
the
study
of
phenomenology
through
the
work
of
edmund
husserl
1913
1929
martin
heidegger
1927
maurice
merleauponty
1945
and
others
who
expanded
the
study
of
consciousness
into
the
realm
of
the
social
the
bodily
and
the
interpersonal
at
the
outset
of
modern
scientific
psychology
in
the
midnineteenth
century
the
mind
was
still
largely
equated
with
consciousness
and
introspective
methods
dominated
the
field
as
in

of

james
1890
and

however
the
relation
of
consciousness
to

remained
very
much
a
mystery
as
expressed
in
t

famous
remark
how
it

anything

consciousness
remained
a

creature
consciousness
an
animal
person
or
other
cognitive
system
may
be
regarded
as
conscious
in
a
number
of
different
senses
sentience
it
may
be
conscious
in
the
generic
sense
of
simply
being
a
sentient
creature
one
capable
of
sensing
and
responding
to
its
world
armstrong
1981
being
conscious
in
this
sense
may
admit
of
degrees
and
just
what
sort
of
sensory
capacities
are
sufficient
may
not
be
sharply
defined
are
fish
conscious
in
the
relevant
respect
and
what
of
shrimp
or
bees
wakefulness
one
might
further
require
that
the
organism
actually
be
exercising
such
a
capacity
rather
than
merely
having
the
ability
or
disposition
to
do
so
thus
one
might
count
it
as
conscious
only
if
it
were
awake
and
normally
alert
in
that
sense
organisms
would
not
count
as
conscious
when
asleep
or
in
any
of
the
deeper
levels
of
coma
again
boundaries
may
be
blurry
and
intermediate
cases
may
be
involved
for
example
is
one
conscious
in
the
relevant
sense
when
dreaming
hypnotized
or
in
a
fugue
state
selfconsciousness
a
third
and
yet
more
demanding
sense
might
define
conscious
creatures
as
those
that
are
not
only
aware
but
also
aware
that
they
are
aware
thus
treating
creature
consciousness
as
a
form
of
selfconsciousness
carruthers
2000
the
selfawareness
requirement
might
get
interpreted
in
a
variety
of
ways
and
which
creatures
would
qualify
as
conscious
in
the
relevant
sense
will
vary
accordingly
if
it
is
taken
to
involve
explicit
conceptual
selfawareness
many
nonhuman
animals
and
even
young
children
might
fail
to
qualify
but
if
only
more
rudimentary
implicit
forms
of
selfawareness
are
required
then
a
wide
range
of
nonlinguistic
creatures
might
count
as
selfconscious
what
it
is
like
thomas
nagel
s
1974
famous
“
what
it
is
like
”
criterion
aims
to
capture
another
and
perhaps
more
subjective
notion
of
being
a
conscious
organism
according
to
nagel
a
being
is
conscious
just
if
there
is
“
something
that
it
is
like
”
to
be
that
creature
i
e
some
subjective
way
the
world
seems
or
appears
from
the
creature
s
mental
or
experiential
point
of
view
in
nagel
s
example
bats
are
conscious
because
there
is
something
that
it
is
like
for
a
bat
to
experience
its
world
through
its
echolocatory
senses
even
though
we
humans
from
our
human
point
of
view
can
not
emphatically
understand
what
such
a
mode
of
consciousness
is
like
from
the
bat
s
own
point
of
view
subject
of
conscious
states
a
fifth
alternative
would
be
to
define
the
notion
of
a
conscious
organism
in
terms
of
conscious
states
that
is
one
might
first
define
what
makes
a
mental
state
a
conscious
mental
state
and
then
define
being
a
conscious
creature
in
terms
of
having
such
states
one
s
concept
of
a
conscious
organism
would
then
depend
upon
the
particular
account
one
gives
of
conscious
states

transitive
consciousness
in
addition
to
describing
creatures
as
conscious
in
these
various
senses
there
are
also
related
senses
in
which
creatures
are
described
as
being
conscious
of
various
things
the
distinction
is
sometimes
marked
as
that
between
transitive
and
intransitive
notions
of
consciousness
with
the
former
involving
some
object
at
which

is

state
consciousness
the
notion
of
a
conscious
mental
state
also
has
a
variety
of
distinct
though
perhaps
interrelated
meanings
there
are
at
least
six
major
options
states
one
is
aware
of
on
one
common
reading
a
conscious
mental
state
is
simply
a
mental
state
one
is
aware
of
being
in
rosenthal
1986
1996
conscious
states
in
this
sense
involve
a
form
of
metamentality
or
metaintentionality
in
so
far
as
they
require
mental
states
that
are
themselves
about
mental
states
to
have
a
conscious
desire
for
a
cup
of
coffee
is
to
have
such
a
desire
and
also
to
be
simultaneously
and
directly
aware
that
one
has
such
a
desire
unconscious
thoughts
and
desires
in
this
sense
are
simply
those
we
have
without
being
aware
of
having
them
whether
our
lack
of
selfknowledge
results
from
simple
inattention
or
more
deeply
psychoanalytic
causes
qualitative
states
states
might
also
be
regarded
as
conscious
in
a
seemingly
quite
different
and
more
qualitative
sense
that
is
one
might
count
a
state
as
conscious
just
if
it
has
or
involves
qualitative
or
experiential
properties
of
the
sort
often
referred
to
as
“
qualia
”
or
“
raw
sensory
feels
”
see
the
entry
on
qualia
one
s
perception
of
the
merlot
one
is
drinking
or
of
the
fabric
one
is
examining
counts
as
a
conscious
mental
state
in
this
sense
because
it
involves
various
sensory
qualia
e
g
taste
qualia
in
the
wine
case
and
color
qualia
in
one
s
visual
experience
of
the
cloth
there
is
considerable
disagreement
about
the
nature
of
such
qualia
churchland
1985
shoemaker
1990

and
even
about
their
existence
traditionally
qualia
have
been
regarded
as
intrinsic
private
ineffable
monadic
features
of
experience
but
current
theories
of
qualia
often
reject
at
least
some
of
those
commitments
dennett
1990
phenomenal
states
such
qualia
are
sometimes
referred
to
as
phenomenal
properties
and
the
associated
sort
of
consciousness
as
phenomenal
consciousness
but
the
latter
term
is
perhaps
more
properly
applied
to
the
overall
structure
of
experience
and
involves
far
more
than
sensory
qualia
the
phenomenal
structure
of
consciousness
also
encompasses
much
of
the
spatial
temporal
and
conceptual
organization
of
our
experience
of
the
world
and
of
ourselves
as
agents
in
it
see
section

it
is
therefore
probably
best
at
least
initially
to
distinguish
the
concept
of
phenomenal
consciousness
from
that
of
qualitative
consciousness
though
they
no
doubt
overlap
whatitislike
states
consciousness
in
both
those
senses
links
up
as
well
with
thomas
nagel
s
1974
notion
of
a
conscious
creature
insofar
as
one
might
count
a
mental
state
as
conscious
in
the
“
what
it
is
like
”
sense
just
if
there
is
something
that
it
is
like
to
be
in
that
state
nagel
s
criterion
might
be
understood
as
aiming
to
provide
a
firstperson
or
internal
conception
of
what
makes
a
state
a
phenomenal
or
qualitative
state
access
consciousness
states
might
be
conscious
in
a
seemingly
quite
different
access
sense
which
has
more
to
do
with
intramental
relations
in
this
respect
a
state
s
being
conscious
is
a
matter
of
its
availability
to
interact
with
other
states
and
of
the
access
that
one
has
to
its
content
in
this
more
functional
sense
which
corresponds
to
what
ned
block
1995
calls
access
consciousness
a
visual
state
s
being
conscious
is
not
so
much
a
matter
of
whether
or
not
it
has
a
qualitative
“
what
it
s
likeness
”
but
of
whether
or
not
it
and
the
visual
information
that
it
carries
is
generally
available
for
use
and
guidance
by
the
organism
in
so
far
as
the
information
in
that
state
is
richly
and
flexibly
available
to
its
containing
organism
then
it
counts
as
a
conscious
state
in
the
relevant
respect
whether
or
not
it
has
any
qualitative
or
phenomenal
feel
in
the
nagel
sense
narrative
consciousness
states
might
also
be
regarded
as
conscious
in
a
narrative
sense
that
appeals
to
the
notion
of
the
“
stream
of
consciousness
”
regarded
as
an
ongoing
more
or
less
serial
narrative
of
episodes
from
the
perspective
of
an
actual
or
merely
virtual
self
the
idea
would
be
to
equate
the
person
s
conscious
mental
states
with
those
that
appear
in
the
stream
dennett
1991
1992
although
these
six
notions
of
what
makes
a
state
conscious
can
be
independently
specified
they
are
obviously
not
without
potential
links
nor
do
they
exhaust
the
realm
of
possible
options
drawing
connections
one
might
argue
that
states
appear
in
the
stream
of
consciousness
only
in
so
far
as
we
are
aware
of
them
and
thus
forge
a
bond
between
the
first
metamental
notion
of
a
conscious
state
and
the
stream
or
narrative
concept
or
one
might
connect
the
access
with
the
qualitative
or
phenomenal
notions
of
a
conscious
state
by
trying
to
show
that
states
that
represent
in
those
ways
make
their
contents
widely
available
in
the
respect
required
by
the
access
notion
aiming
to
go
beyond
the
six
options
one
might
distinguish
conscious
from
nonconscious
states
by
appeal
to
aspects
of
their
intramental
dynamics
and
interactions
other
than
mere
access
relations
e
g
conscious
states
might
manifest
a
richer
stock
of
contentsensitive
interactions
or
a
greater
degree
of
flexible
purposive
guidance
of
the
sort
associated
with
the
selfconscious
control
of
thought
alternatively
one
might
try
to
define
conscious
states
in
terms
of
conscious
creatures
that
is
one
might
give
some
account
of
what
it
is
to
be
a
conscious
creature
or
perhaps
even
a
conscious
self
and
then
define
one
s
notion
of
a
conscious
state
in
terms
of
being
a
state
of
such
a
creature
or
system
which
would
be
the
converse
of
the
last
option
considered
above
for
defining
conscious
creatures
in
terms
of
conscious
mental
states

consciousness
as
an
entity
the
noun
“
consciousness
”
has
an
equally
diverse
range
of
meanings
that
largely
parallel
those
of
the
adjective
“
conscious
”
distinctions
can
be
drawn
between
creature
and
state
consciousness
as
well
as
among
the
varieties
of
each
one
can
refer
specifically
to
phenomenal
consciousness
access
consciousness
reflexive
or
metamental
consciousness
and
narrative
consciousness
among
other
varieties
here
consciousness
itself
is
not
typically
treated
as
a
substantive
entity
but
merely
the
abstract
reification
of
whatever
property
or
aspect
is
attributed
by
the
relevant
use
of
the
adjective
“
conscious
”
access
consciousness
is
just
the
property
of
having
the
required
sort
of
internal
access
relations
and
qualitative
consciousness
is
simply
the
property
that
is
attributed
when
“
conscious
”
is
applied
in
the
qualitative
sense
to
mental
states
how
much
this
commits
one
to
the
ontological
status
of
consciousness
per
se
will
depend
on
how
much
of
a
platonist
one
is
about
universals
in
general
see
the
entry
on
the
medieval
problem
of
universals
it
need
not
commit
one
to
consciousness
as
a
distinct
entity
any
more
than
one
s
use
of
“
square
”
“
red
”
or
“
gentle
”
commits
one
to
the
existence
of
squareness
redness
or
gentleness
as
distinct
entities
though
it
is
not
the
norm
one
could
nonetheless
take
a
more
robustly
realist
view
of
consciousness
as
a
component
of
reality
that
is
one
could
think
of
consciousness
as
more
on
a
par
with
electromagnetic
fields
than
with
life
since
the
demise
of
vitalism
we
do
not
think
of
life
per
se
as
something
distinct
from
living
things
there
are
living
things
including
organisms
states
properties
and
parts
of
organisms
communities
and
evolutionary
lineages
of
organisms
but
life
is
not
itself
a
further
thing
an
additional
component
of
reality
some
vital
force
that
gets
added
into
living
things
we
apply
the
adjectives
“
living
”
and
“
alive
”
correctly
to
many
things
and
in
doing
so
we
might
be
said
to
be
attributing
life
to
them
but
with
no
meaning
or
reality
other
than
that
involved
in
their
being
living
things
electromagnetic
fields
by
contrast
are
regarded
as
real
and
independent
parts
of
our
physical
world
even
though
one
may
sometimes
be
able
to
specify
the
values
of
such
a
field
by
appeal
to
the
behavior
of
particles
in
it
the
fields
themselves
are
regarded
as
concrete
constituents
of
reality
and
not
merely
as
abstractions
or
sets
of
relations
among
particles
similarly
one
could
regard
“
consciousness
”
as
referring
to
a
component
or
aspect
of
reality
that
manifests
itself
in
conscious
states
and
creatures
but
is
more
than
merely
the
abstract
nominalization
of
the
adjective
“
conscious
”
we
apply
to
them
though
such
strongly
realist
views
are
not
very
common
at
present
they
should
be
included
within
the
logical
space
of
options
there
are
thus
many
concepts
of
consciousness
and
both
“
conscious
”
and
“
consciousness
”
are
used
in
a
wide
range
of
ways
with
no
privileged
or
canonical
meaning
however
this
may
be
less
of
an
embarrassment
than
an
embarrassment
of
riches
consciousness
is
a
complex
feature
of
the
world
and
understanding
it
will
require
a
diversity
of
conceptual
tools
for
dealing
with
its
many
differing
aspects
conceptual
plurality
is
thus
just
what
one
would
hope
for
as
long
as
one
avoids
confusion
by
being
clear
about
one
s
meanings
there
is
great
value
in
having
a
variety
of
concepts
by
which
we
can
access
and
grasp
consciousness
in
all
its
rich
complexity
however
one
should
not
assume
that
conceptual
plurality
implies
referential
divergence
our
multiple
concepts
of
consciousness
may
in
fact
pick
out
varying
aspects
of
a
single
unified
underlying
mental
phenomenon

and
to
what

they
do
so
remains

problems
of
consciousness
the
task
of
understanding
consciousness
is
an
equally
diverse
project
not
only
do
many
different
aspects
of
mind
count
as
conscious
in
some
sense
each
is
also
open
to
various
respects
in
which
it
might
be
explained
or
modeled
understanding
consciousness
involves
a
multiplicity
not
only
of
explananda
but
also
of
questions
that
they
pose
and
the
sorts
of
answers
they
require
at
the
risk
of
oversimplifying
the
relevant
questions
can
be
gathered
under
three
crude
rubrics
as
the
what
how
and
why
questions
the
descriptive
question
what
is
consciousness
what
are
its
principal
features
and
by
what
means
can
they
be
best
discovered
described
and
modeled
the
explanatory
question
how
does
consciousness
of
the
relevant
sort
come
to
exist
is
it
a
primitive
aspect
of
reality
and
if
not
how
does
or
could
consciousness
in
the
relevant
respect
arise
from
or
be
caused
by
nonconscious
entities
or
processes
the
functional
question
why
does
consciousness
of
the
relevant
sort
exist
does
it
have
a
function
and
if
so
what
is
it
does
it
act
causally
and
if
so
with
what
sorts
of
effects
does
it
make
a
difference
to
the
operation
of
systems
in
which
it
is
present
and
if
so
why
and
how
the
three
questions
focus
respectively
on
describing
the
features
of
consciousness
explaining
its
underlying
basis
or
cause
and
explicating
its
role
or
value
the
divisions
among
the
three
are
of
course
somewhat
artificial
and
in
practice
the
answers
one
gives
to
each
will
depend
in
part
on
what
one
says
about
the
others
one
can
not
for
example
adequately
answer
the
what
question
and
describe
the
main
features
of
consciousness
without
addressing
the
why
issue
of
its
functional
role
within
systems
whose
operations
it
affects
nor
could
one
explain
how
the
relevant
sort
of
consciousness
might
arise
from
nonconscious
processes
unless
one
had
a
clear
account
of
just
what
features
had
to
be
caused
or
realized
to
count
as
producing
it
those
caveats
notwithstanding
the
threeway
division
of
questions
provides
a
useful
structure
for
articulating
the
overall
explanatory
project
and
for
assessing
the
adequacy
of
particular
theories
or
models
of
consciousness

the
descriptive
question
what
are
the
features
of
consciousness
the
what
question
asks
us
to
describe
and
model
the
principal
features
of
consciousness
but
just
which
features
are
relevant
will
vary
with
the
sort
of
consciousness
we
aim
to
capture
the
main
properties
of
access
consciousness
may
be
quite
unlike
those
of
qualitative
or
phenomenal
consciousness
and
those
of
reflexive
consciousness
or
narrative
consciousness
may
differ
from
both
however
by
building
up
detailed
theories
of
each
type
we
may
hope
to
find
important
links
between
them
and
perhaps
even
to
discover
that
they
coincide
in
at

some
key

qualitative
character
qualitative
character
is
often
equated
with
so
called
“
raw
feels
”
and
illustrated
by
the
redness
one
experiences
when
one
looks
at
ripe
tomatoes
or
the
specific
sweet
savor
one
encounters
when
one
tastes
an
equally
ripe
pineapple
locke
1688
the
relevant
sort
of
qualitative
character
is
not
restricted
to
sensory
states
but
is
typically
taken
to
be
present
as
an
aspect
of
experiential
states
in
general
such
as
experienced
thoughts
or
desires
siewert
1998
the
existence
of
such
feels
may
seem
to
some
to
mark
the
threshold
for
states
or
creatures
that
are
really
conscious
if
an
organism
senses
and
responds
in
apt
ways
to
its
world
but
lacks
such
qualia
then
it
might
count
as
conscious
at
best
in
a
loose
and
less
than
literal
sense
or
so
at
least
it
would
seem
to
those
who
take
qualitative
consciousness
in
the
“
what
it
is

sense

the

again
there
are
good
reason
to
recognize
it

in
some
of
its
forms
as

consciousness
—
related
to
the
qualitative
and
the
phenomenal
but
different
from
each

the
epistemic
form
of
subjectivity

apparent

on
the

or
even
the

selfperspectival
organization
the
perspectival
structure
of
consciousness
is
one
aspect
of
its
overall
phenomenal
organization
but
it
is
important
enough
to
merit
discussion
in
its
own
right
insofar
as
the
key
perspective
is
that
of
the
conscious
self

might
be
called

experiences
do
not
exist
as

unity
unity
is
closely
linked
with
the
selfperspective
but
it
merits
specific
mention
on
its
own
as
a
key
aspect
of
the
organization
of
consciousness
conscious
systems
and
conscious
mental
states
both
involve
many
diverse
forms
of
unity
some
are
causal
unities
associated
with
the
integration
of
action
and
control
into
a
unified
focus
of
agency
others
are
more
representational
and
intentional
forms
of
unity
involving
the
integration
of
diverse
items
of
content

many
scales
and
levels

some
such
integrations
are
relatively
local

intentionality
and

regarded

are

however
nonconscious

in
such
ways
and
it
is
important
to
understand
the
ways
in
which
the
representational
aspects
of

resemble
and
differ
from
those
of
nonconscious

a
contrary
view
according
to
which
only
conscious

dispositions
to
have

states
can
be
genuinely
intentional
but
most
theorists
regard
intentionality
as
extending
widely
into
the
unconscious
domain

“

our

far
as
we
seem

conscious
thoughts
and
experiences
are
also
transparent
in
a
semantic
sense
in
that
their
meanings
seem
immediately
known
to
us
in
the
very
act
of
thinking
them

they

represent
transparency
in
this
semantic
sense
may
correspond
at
least
partly
with
what
john
searle
calls
the
“
intrinsic
intentionality
”
of
consciousness
searle
1992
our
conscious
mental
states
seem
to
have
their
meanings
intrinsically
or
from
the
inside
just
by
being
what
they
are
in
themselves
by
contrast
with
many
externalist
theories
of
mental
content
that
ground
meaning
in
causal
counterfactual
or
informational
relations
between
bearers
of
intentionality
and
their
semantic
or
referential
objects
the
view
of
conscious
content
as
intrinsically
determined
and
internally
selfevident
is
sometimes
supported
by
appeals
to
brain
in
the
vat
intuitions
which
make
it
seem
that
the
envatted
brain
s
conscious
mental
states
would
keep
all
their
normal
intentional
contents

loss
of
all
their

and

of

intentionality
though
semantic
transparency
and

intentionality
have
some
affinities
they
should
not
be
simply
equated
since
it
may
be
possible
to

the

externalist
account

they
are

the
dynamics
of

are
evident
in
the
coherent
order
of
its
ever
changing
process
of
flow
and
selftransformation
what
william
james
1890
called
the
“
stream
of
consciousness
”
some
temporal
sequences
of
experience
are
generated
by
purely
internal
factors
as
when
one
thinks
through
a
puzzle
and
others
depend
in
part
upon
external
causes
as
when
one
chases
a
fly
ball
but
even
the
latter
sequences
are
shaped
in
large
part
by
how
consciousness
transforms
itself

partly
in
response
to
outer
influences

entirely
from

an

to

more
than

its

it
must
give
some
account
of
the
temporal

the
ways
in
which
its

reflects
both
its

to

than

having

its

in

is
it
a
fundamental

in

diversity
of
explanatory
projects
the
how
question
is
not
a
single
question
but
rather
a
general
family
of
more
specific
questions
van
gulick
1995
they
all
concern
the
possibility
of
explaining
some
sort
or
aspect
of
consciousness
but
they
vary
in
their
particular
explananda
the
restrictions
on
their
explanans
and
their
criteria
for
successful
explanation
for
example
one
might
ask
whether
we
can
explain
access
consciousness
computationally
by
mimicking
the
requisite
access
relations
in
a
computational
model
or
one
might
be
concerned
instead
with
whether
the
phenomenal
and
qualitative
properties
of
a
conscious
creature
s
mind
can
be
a
priori
deduced
from
a
description
of
the
neural
properties
of
its
brain
processes
both
are
versions
of
the
how
question
but
they
ask
about
the
prospects
of
very
different
explanatory
projects
and
thus
may
differ
in
their
answers
lycan
1996
it
would
be
impractical
if
not
impossible
to
catalog
all
the
possible
versions
of
the
how
question
but
some
of
the
main
options
can
be
listed
explananda
possible
explananda
would
include
the
various
sorts
of
state
and
creature
consciousness
distinguished
above
as
well
as
the
seven
features
of
consciousness
listed
in
response
to
the
what
question
those
two
types
of
explananda
overlap
and
intersect
we
might
for
example
aim
to
explain
the
dynamic
aspect
either
of
phenomenal
or
of
access
consciousness
or
we
could
try
to
explain
the
subjectivity
of
either
qualitative
or
metamental
consciousness
not
every
feature
applies
to
every
sort
of
consciousness
but
all
apply
to
several
how
one
explains
a

feature
in
relation
to
one
sort
of
consciousness
may
not
correspond
with
what
is
needed
to
explain
it
relative
to
another
explanans
the
range
of
possible
explanans
is
also
diverse
in
perhaps
its
broadest
form
the
how
question
asks
how
consciousness
of
the
relevant
sort
could
be
caused
or
realized
by
nonconscious
items
but
we
can
generate
a
wealth
of
more
specific
questions
by
further
restricting
the
range
of
the
relevant
explanans
one
might
seek
to
explain
how
a
given
feature
of
consciousness
is
caused
or
realized
by
underlying
neural
processes
biological
structures
physical
mechanisms
functional
or
teleofunctional
relations
computational
organization
or
even
by
nonconscious
mental
states
the
prospects
for
explanatory
success
will
vary
accordingly

and
elementary
the
range
of

criteria
of
explanation
the
third
key
parameter
is
how
one
defines
the
criterion
for
a
successful
explanation
one
might
require
that
the
explanandum
be
a
priori
deducible
from
the
explanans
although
it
is
controversial
whether
this
is
either
a
necessary
or
a
sufficient
criterion
for
explaining
consciousness
jackson
1993
its
sufficiency
will
depend
in
part
on
the
nature
of
the
premises
from
which
the
deduction
proceeds
as
a
matter
of
logic
one
will
need
some
bridge
principles
to
connect
propositions
or
sentences
about
consciousness
with
those
that
do
not
mention
it
if
one
s
premises
concern
physical
or
neural
facts
then
one
will
need
some
bridge
principles
or
links
that
connect
such
facts
with
facts
about
consciousness
kim
1998
brute
links
whether
nomic
or
merely
well
confirmed
correlations
could
provide
a
logically
sufficient
bridge
to
infer
conclusions
about
consciousness
but
they
would
probably
not
allow
us
to
see
how
or
why
those
connections
hold
and
thus
they
would
fall
short
of
fully
explaining
how
consciousness
exists
levine
1983
1993
mcginn
1991
one
could
legitimately
ask
for
more
in
particular
for
some
account
that
made
intelligible
why
those
links
hold
and
perhaps
why
they
could
not
fail
to
do
so
a
familiar
twostage
model
for
explaining
macroproperties
in
terms
of
microsubstrates
is
often
invoked
in
the
first
step
one
analyzes
the
macroproperty
in
terms
of
functional
conditions
and
then
in
the
second
stage
one
shows
that
the
microstructures
obeying
the
laws
of
their
own
level
nomically
suffice
to
guarantee
the
satisfaction
of
the
relevant
functional
conditions

the
microproperties
of

suffice
to
satisfy
the
conditions
for
the
liquidity
of
the
water
they
compose
moreover
the
model
makes
intelligible
how
the
liquidity
is
produced
by
the
microproperties
a
satisfactory
explanation
of
how
consciousness
is
produced
might
seem
to
require
a
similar
two
stage
story
without
it
even
a
priori
deducibility
might
seem
explanatorily
less
than
sufficient

the
explanatory
gap
our
current
inability
to
supply
a
suitably
intelligible
link
is
sometimes
described
following
joseph
levine
1983
as
the
existence
of
an
explanatory
gap
and
as
indicating
our
incomplete
understanding
of
how
consciousness
might
depend
upon
a
nonconscious
substrate
especially
a
physical
substrate
the
basic
gap
claim
admits
of
many
variations
in
generality
and
thus
in
strength
in
perhaps
its
weakest
form
it
asserts
a
practical
limit
on
our
present
explanatory
abilities
given
our
current
theories
and
models
we
can
not
now
articulate
an
intelligible
link
a
stronger
version
makes
an
in
principle
claim
about
our
human
capacities
and
thus
asserts
that
given
our
human
cognitive
limits
we
will
never
be
able
to
bridge
the
gap
to
us
or
creatures
cognitively
like
us
it
must
remain
a
residual
mystery
mcginn
1991
colin
mcginn
1995
has
argued
that
given
the
inherently
spatial
nature
of
both
our
human
perceptual
concepts
and
the
scientific
concepts
we
derive
from
them
we
humans
are
not
conceptually
suited
for
understanding
the
nature
of
the
psychophysical
link
facts
about
that
link
are
as
cognitively
closed
to
us
as
are
facts
about
multiplication
or
square
roots
to
armadillos
they
do
not
fall
within
our
conceptual
and
cognitive
repertoire
an
even
stronger
version
of
the
gap
claim
removes
the
restriction
to
our
cognitive
nature
and
denies
in
principle
that
the
gap
can
be
closed
by
any
cognitive
agents
those
who
assert
gap
claims
disagree
among
themselves
about
what
metaphysical
conclusions
if
any
follow
from
our
supposed
epistemic
limits
levine
himself
has
been
reluctant
to
draw
any
antiphysicalist
ontological
conclusions
levine
1993
2001
on
the
other
hand
some
neodualists
have
tried
to
use
the
existence
of
the
gap
to
refute
physicalism
foster
1996
chalmers
1996
the
stronger
one
s
epistemological
premise
the
better
the
hope
of
deriving
a
metaphysical
conclusion
thus
unsurprisingly
dualist
conclusions
are
often
supported
by
appeals
to
the
supposed
impossibility
in
principle
of
closing
the
gap
if
one
could
see
on
a
priori
grounds
that
there
is
no
way
in
which
consciousness
could
be
intelligibly
explained
as
arising
from
the
physical
it
would
not
be
a
big
step
to
concluding
that
it
in
fact
does
not
do
so
chalmers
1996
however
the
very
strength
of
such
an
epistemological
claim
makes
it
difficult
to
assume
with
begging
the
metaphysical
result
in
question
thus
those
who
wish
to
use
a
strong
in
principle
gap
claim
to
refute
physicalism
must
find
independent
grounds
to
support
it

and
for
the

that

and

systems
that
may
not
be
strictly
intertranslatable
or

cited
as

fodor

economic
facts
may
be
realized
by
underlying
physical
processes
but
no
one
seriously
demands
that
we
be
able
to
deduce
the
relevant
economic
facts
from
detailed
descriptions
of
their
underlying
physical
bases
or
that
we
be
able
to
put
the
concepts
and
vocabulary
of
economics
in
tight
correspondence
with
those
of
the
physical
sciences
nonetheless
our
deductive
inability
is
not
seen
as
cause
for
ontological
misgivings
there
is
no
“
moneymatter
”
problem
all
that
we
require
is
some
general
and
less
than
deductive
understanding
of
how
economic
properties
and
relations
might
be
underlain
by
physical
ones
thus
one
might
opt
for
a
similar
criterion
for
interpreting
the
how
question
and
for
what
counts
as
explaining
how
consciousness
might
be
caused
or
realized
by
nonconscious
items
however
some
critics
such
as
kim
1987
have
challenged
the
coherence
of
any
view
that
aims
to
be
both
nonreductive
and
physicalist
though
supporters
of
such
views
have
replied
in
turn
van
gulick
1993
others
have
argued
that
consciousness
is
especially
resistant
to
explanation
in
physical
terms
because
of
the
inherent
differences
between
our
subjective
and
objective
modes
of
understanding
thomas
nagel
famously
argued
1974
that
there
are
unavoidable
limits
placed
on
our
ability
to
understand
the
phenomenology
of
bat
experience
by
our
inability
to
empathetically
take
on
an
experiential
perspective
like
that
which
characterizes
the
bat
s
echolocatory
auditory
experience
of
its
world
given
our
inability
to
undergo
similar
experience
we
can
have
at
best
partial
understanding
of
the
nature
of
such
experience
no
amount
of
knowledge
gleaned
from
the
external
objective
thirdperson
perspective
of
the
natural
sciences
will
supposedly
suffice
to
allow
us
to
understand
what
the
bat
can
understand
of
its
own
experience
from
its
internal
firstperson
subjective
point

the
how
question
thus
subdivides
into
a
diverse
family
of
more
specific
questions
depending
upon
the
specific
sort
or
feature
of
consciousness
one
aims
to
explain
the
specific

one
places
on
the
range
of
the
explanans
and
the
criterion
one
uses
to
define

some
of
the
resulting
variants
seem
easier
to
answer
than

progress
may
seem

on
some
of
the
so
called
“

”

as

of

consciousness
in

of

others
may
seem

the

”
chalmers
1995
which
is
more
or
less
that
of
giving

from

positive

to
some
versions
of
the

seem
near
at
hand
but
others
appear
to
remain
deeply
baffling
nor
should
we
assume
that
every
version
has
a
positive
answer
if
dualism
is
true
then
consciousness
in
at
least
some
of
its
types
may
be
basic
and
fundamental
if
sowe
will
not
be
able
to
explain
how
it
arises
from
nonconscious
items
since
it
simply
does
not
do
so
one
s
view
of
the
prospects
for
explaining
consciousness
will
typically
depend
upon
one
s
perspective
optimistic
physicalists
will
likely
see
current
explanatory
lapses
as
merely
the
reflection
of
the
early
stage
of
inquiry
and
sure
to
be
remedied
in
the
not

distant
future

those

bankruptcy

what

sees
depends
in

on
where

stands

be
accompanied

about

the
functional
question
why
does
consciousness
exist
the
functional
or
why
question
asks
about
the
value
or
role
or
consciousness
and
thus
indirectly
about
its
origin
does
it
have
a
function
and
if
so
what
is
it
does
it
make
a
difference
to
the
operation
of
systems
in
which
it
is
present
and
if
so
why
and
how
if
consciousness
exists
as
a
complex
feature
of
biological
systems
then
its
adaptive
value
is
likely
relevant
to
explaining
its
evolutionary
origin
though
of
course
its
present
function
if
it
has
one
need
not
be
the
same
as
that
it
may
have
had
when
it
first
arose
adaptive
functions
often
change
over
biological
time
questions
about
the
value
of
consciousness
also
have
a
moral
dimension
in
at
least
two
ways
we
are
inclined
to
regard
an
organism
s
moral
status
as
at
least
partly
determined
by
the
nature
and
extent
to
which
it
is
conscious
and
conscious
states
especially
conscious
affective
states
such
as
pleasures
and
pains
play
a
major
role
in
many
of
the
accounts
of
value
that
underlie
moral
theory

as
with
the
what
and
how
questions
the
why

poses
a
general
problem
that
subdivides
into
a
diversity
of
more
specific
inquiries
in
so
far
as
the
various
sorts
of
consciousness
e
g
access
phenomenal

are
distinct
and
separable
—
which
remains
an
open
question
—
they
likely
also

causal
status
of
consciousness
perhaps
the
most
basic
issue
posed
by
any
version
of
the
why
question
is
whether
or
not
consciousness
of
the
relevant
sort
has
any
causal
impact
at
all
if
it
has
no
effects
and
makes
no
causal
difference
whatsoever
then
it
would
seem
unable
to
play
any
significant
role
in
the
systems
or
organisms
in
which
it
is
present
thus
undercutting
at
the
outset
most
inquiries
about
its
possible
value
nor
can
the
threat
of
epiphenomenal
irrelevance
be
simply
dismissed
as
an
obvious
nonoption
since
at
least
some
forms
of
consciousness
have
been
seriously
alleged
in
the
recent
literature
to
lack
causal
status
see
the
entry
on
epiphenomenalism
such
worries
have
been
raised
especially
with
regard
to
qualia
and
qualitative
consciousness

chalmers

but
challenges
have
also
been
leveled
against
the
causal
status
of
other
sorts
including
metamental
consciousness
velmans
1991
both
metaphysical
and
empirical
arguments
have
been
given
in
support
of
such
claims
among
the
former
are
those
that
appeal
to
intuitions
about
the
conceivability
and
logical
possibility
of
zombies
i
e
of
beings
whose
behavior
functional
organization
and
physical
structure
down
to
the
molecular
level
are
identical
to
those
of
normal
human
agents
but
who
lack
any
qualia
or
qualitative
consciousness
some
kirk
1970
chalmers
1996
assert
such
beings
are
possible
in
worlds
that
share
all
our
physical
laws
but
others
deny
it
dennett
1991
levine
2001
if
they
are
possible
in
such
worlds
then
it
would
seem
to
follow
that
even
in
our
world
qualia
do
not
affect
the
course
of
physical
events
including
those
that
constitute
our
human
behaviors
if
those
events
unfold
in
the
same
way
whether
or
not
qualia
are
present
then
qualia
appear
to
be
inert
or
epiphenomenal
at
least
with
respect
to
events
in
the
physical
world
however
such
arguments
and
the
zombie
intuitions
on
which
they
rely
are
controversial
and
their
soundness
remains
in
dispute

arguments
of
a
far
more
empirical
sort
have
challenged
the
causal
status
of
metamental
consciousness
at
least
in
so
far
as
its
presence
can
be
measured
by
the
ability
to
report
on
one
s
mental
state
scientific
evidence
is
claimed
to
show
that
consciousness
of
that
sort
is
neither
necessary
for
any
type
of
mental
ability
nor
does
it
occur
early
enough
to
act
as
a
cause
of
the
acts
or
processes
typically
thought
to
be
its
effects
velmans
1991
according
to
those
who
make
such
arguments
the
sorts
of
mental
abilities
that
are
typically
thought
to
require
consciousness
can
all
be
realized
unconsciously
in
the
absence
of
the
supposedly
required
selfawareness
moreover
even
when
conscious
selfawareness
is
present
it
allegedly
occurs
too
late
to
be
the
cause
of
the
relevant
actions
rather
than
their
result
or
at
best
a
joint
effect
of
some
shared
prior
cause
libet
1985
selfawareness
or
metamental
consciousness
according
to
these
arguments
turns
out
to
be
a
psychological
aftereffect
rather
than
an
initiating
cause
more
like
a
post
facto
printout
or
the
result
displayed
on

s
computer
screen
than
like
the
actual
processor
operations
that
produce
both
the
computer
s
response
and
its
display
once
again
the
arguments
are
controversial
and
both
the
supposed
data
and
their
interpretation
are
subjects
of
lively
disagreement
see
flanagan
1992
and
commentaries
accompanying
velmans
1991
though
the
empirical
arguments
like
the
zombie
claims
require
one
to
consider
seriously
whether
some
forms
of
consciousness
may
be
less
causally
potent
than
is
typically
assumed
many
theorists
regard
the
empirical
data
as
no
real
threat
to
the
causal
status
of
consciousness
if
the
epiphenomenalists
are
wrong
and
consciousness
in
its
various
forms
is
indeed

flexible

conscious
mental

appear
to
provide
highly
flexible
and
adaptive
forms
of
control
though
unconscious
automatic
processes
can
be
extremely
efficient
and
rapid
they
typically
operate
in
ways
that
are
more
fixed
and
predetermined
than
those
which
involve
conscious

out
of

as
well
as
for
the
deliberate
control
of
their

there
is
a
familiar
tradeoff
between
flexibility

controlled
conscious

purchase
their

the
price
of
being
slow

to
the

operations
anderson
1983
the
relevant
increases
in
flexibility
would
seem
most
closely
connected
with
the
metamental
or
higherorder
form
of
consciousness
in
so
far
as
the
enhanced
ability
to
control
processes
depends
upon
greater
selfawareness
however
flexibility
and
sophisticated
modes
of
control
may
be
associated
as
well
with
the

forms

social
coordination

capacity
for
social
coordination
consciousness
of
the
metamental
sort
may
well
involve
not
only
an
increase
in
selfawareness
but
also
an
enhanced
understanding
of
the
mental
states
of
other

it
is
to
have
such

and
are
aware
of
both
themselves
and
others
as

them
this
increase
in

of

other

enables

may
itself
remain
too
murky
and
contentious
to
shed
any
clear
light
on
the
role
of
consciousness
but
there
is
a
traditional
intuition
that
the
two
are
deeply
linked
consciousness
has
been
thought
to
open
a
realm
of
possibilities
a
sphere
of
options
within
which
the
conscious
self
might
choose
or
act
freely
at
a
minimum
consciousness
might
seem
a
necessary
precondition
for
any
such
freedom

hasker
1999
how
could
one
engage
in
the
requisite
sort
of

choice
while
remaining
solely
within
the
unconscious
domain
how
can
one
determine
one
s
own
will
without
being
conscious
of
it

of
the
options
one
has
to
shape
it
the
freedom
to

one

actions

the
ability
to
determine

may
admit
of
many
interesting
variations
and
degrees
rather
than
being
a
simple
all

nothing
matter
and
various
forms
or
levels
of
consciousness
might
be
correlated
with
corresponding
degrees
or
types
of

the
link
with

seems
strongest
for
the

form
of

intrinsic
motivation
intrinsically
motivating
states
at
least
some
conscious
states
appear
to
have
the
motive
force
they
do
intrinsically
in
particular
the
functional
and
motivational
roles
of
conscious
affective
states
such
as
pleasures
and
pains
seem
intrinsic
to
their
experiential
character
and
inseparable
from
their
qualitative
and
phenomenal
properties
though
the
view
has
been
challenged
nelkin
1989
rosenthal
1991
the
attractive
positive
motivational
aspect
of
a
pleasure
seems
a
part
of
its
directly
experienced
phenomenal
feel
as
does
the
negative
affective
character
of
a
pain
at
least
in
the
case
of
normal
nonpathological
experience
there
is
considerable
disagreement
about
the
extent
to
which
the
feel
and
motive
force
of
pain
can
dissociate
in
abnormal
cases
and
some
have
denied
the
existence
of
such
intrinsically
motivating
aspects
altogether
dennett
1991
however
at
least
in
the
normal
case
the
negative
motivational
force
of
pain
seems
built
right
into
the
feel
of
the
experience
itself
just
how
this
might
be
so
remains
less
than
clear
and
perhaps
the
appearance
of
intrinsic
and
directly
experienced
motivational
force
is
illusory
but
if
it
is
real
then
it
may
be
one
of
the
most
important
and
evolutionarily
oldest
respects
in
which
consciousness
makes
a
difference
to
the
mental
systems
and
processes
in
which
it
is
present
humphreys

other
suggestions
have
been
made
about
the
possible
roles
and
value
of
consciousness
and
these
six
surely
do
not
exhaust
the
options
nonetheless
they
are
among
the
most
prominent
recent
hypotheses

they
provide
a
fair
survey
of
the
sorts
of

that
have

constitutive
and
contingent
roles
one
further
point
requires
clarification
about
the
various
respects
in
which
the
proposed
functions
might
answer
the
why
question
in
particular
one
should
distinguish
between
constitutive
cases
and
cases
of
contingent
realization
in
the
former
fulfilling
the
role
constitutes
being
conscious
in
the
relevant
sense
while
in
the
latter
case
consciousness
of
a
given
sort
is
just
one
way
among
several
in
which
the
requisite
role
might
be
realized
van
gulick
1993
for
example
making
information
globally
available
for
use
by
a
wide
variety
of
subsystems
and
behavioral
applications
may
constitute
its
being
conscious
in
the
access
sense
by
contrast
even
if
the
qualitative
and
phenomenal
forms
of
consciousness
involve
a
highly
unified
and
densely
integrated
representation
of
objective
reality
it
may
be
possible
to
produce
representations
having
those
functional
characteristics
but
which
are
not
qualitative
or
phenomenal
in
nature
the
fact
that
in
us
the
modes
of
representation
with
those
characteristics
also
have
qualitative
and
phenomenal
properties
may
reflect
contingent
historical
facts
about
the
particular
design
solution
that
happened
to
arise
in
our
evolutionary
ancestry
if
so
there
may
be
quite
other
means
of
achieving
a
comparable
result
without
qualitative
or
phenomenal
consciousness
whether
this
is
the
right
way
to
think
about
phenomenal
and
qualitative
conscious
is
unclear
perhaps
the
tie
to
unified
and
densely
integrated
representation
is
in
fact
as
intimate
and
constitutive
as
it
seems
to
be
in
the
case
of
access
consciousness

theories
of
consciousness
in
response
to
the
what
how
and
why
questions
many
theories
of
consciousness
have
been
proposed
in
recent
years
however
not
all
theories
of
consciousness
are
theories
of
the
same
thing
they
vary
not
only
in
the
specific
sorts
of
consciousness
they
take
as
their
object
but
also
in
their
theoretical
aims
perhaps
the
largest
division
is
between
general
metaphysical
theories
that
aim
to
locate
consciousness
in
the
overall
ontological
scheme
of
reality
and
more
specific
theories
that
offer
detailed
accounts
of
its
nature
features
and
role
the
line
between
the
two
sorts
of
theories
blurs
a
bit
especially
in
so
far
as
many
specific
theories
carry
at
least
some
implicit
commitments
on
the
more
general
metaphysical
issues
nonetheless
it
is
useful
to
keep
the
division
in
mind

surveying
the

dualist

different
types
fundamental

dualism
regards
conscious
mental
properties
as
basic
constituents
of
reality
on
a
par
with
fundamental
physical
properties
such
as
electromagnetic
charge
they
may
interact
in
causal
and
lawlike
ways
with
other
fundamental
properties
such
as
those
of
physics
but
ontologically
their
existence
is
not
dependent
upon
nor
derivative
from
any
other
properties
chalmers
1996
emergent
property
dualism
treats
conscious
properties
as
arising
from
complex
organizations
of
physical
constituents
but
as
doing
so
in
a
radical
way
such
that
the
emergent
result
is
something
over
and
above
its
physical
causes
and
is
not
a
priori
predictable
from
nor
explicable
in
terms
of
their
strictly
physical
natures
the
coherence
of
such
emergent
views
has
been
challenged

neutral
monist
property
dualism
treats
both

as

way

a
more
basic
level
of
reality
that
in
itself
is
neither
mental
nor
physical

however
if
one
takes
dualism
to
be
a
claim
about
there
being
two
distinct
realms
of
fundamental
entities
or
properties
then
perhaps
neutral
monism
should
not
be
classified
as
a
version
of
property
dualism
in
so
far
as
it
does
not
regard
either
mental
or
physical
properties
as
ultimate
or
fundamental
panpsychism
might
be
regarded
as
a
fourth
type
of
property
dualism
in
that
it
regards
all
the
constituents
of
reality
as
having
some
psychic
or
at
least
protopsychic
properties
distinct
from
whatever
physical
properties
they
may
have
nagel
1979
indeed
neutral
monism
might
be
consistently
combined
with
some
version
of
panprotopsychism
chalmers

to
which
the
protomental
aspects
of
microconstituents
can
give
rise
under
suitable
conditions
of
combination
to
full

consciousness
see
the
entry
on
panpsychism
the
nature
of
the
relevant
protopsychic
aspect
remains
unclear
and
such
theories
face
a
dilemma
if
offered
in
hope
of
answering
the
hard
problem
either
the
protopsychic
properties
involve
the
sort
of
qualitative
phenomenal
feel
that
generates
the
hard
problem
or
they
do
not
if
they
do
it
is
difficult
to
understand
how
they
could
possibly
occur
as
ubiquitous
properties
of
reality
how
could
an
electron
or
a
quark
have
any
such
experiential
feel
however
if
the
protopsychic
properties
do
not
involve
any
such
feel
it
is
not
clear
how
they
are
any
better
able
than
physical
properties
to
account
for
qualitative
consciousness
in
solving
the
hard
problem
a
more
modest
form
of
panpsychism

this

there

the

it

it

thus
there
is
no

to
bridge
and
no

is

identities
are
not
the
sort
of
thing
that
can
be
explained
since
nothing
is
identical
with
anything
but
itself
and
it
makes
no

to
ask
why
something
is

unconscious
precisely
in
that
we
lack
the

than

on
the

hand
can

that

explains
some
of
the
additional
conditions
required

as
natural
consequences
of
the

the

in

those
conditions
are

whatever

both

challenges

having

nor
will
it
suffice
to
note
that
we
do
not
apply
the
term
“
conscious
”
to
rocks
or
pens
that
we
perceive

only
to

that
may
be
true
but
what
is
needed
is
some
account
of
why
it

appropriate
to
do
so
the
higherorder
view
is
most
obviously
relevant
to
the
metamental
forms
of
consciousness
but
some
of
its
supporters
take
it
to
explain
other
types
of
consciousness
as
well
including
the
more
subjective
what
it
s
like
and
qualitative
types
one
common
strategy
is
to
analyze
qualia
as
mental
features
that
are
capable
of
occurring
unconsciously
for
example
they
might
be
explained
as
properties

reflexive
theories
reflexive
theories
like
higherorder
theories
imply
a
strong
link
between
consciousness
and
selfawareness
they
differ
in
that
they
locate
the
aspect
of
selfawareness
directly
within
the
conscious
state
itself
rather
than
in
a
distinct
metastate
directed
at

the
idea
that
conscious
states
involve
a
double
intentionality
goes
back
at
least
to
brentano
1874
in
the
19th
century
the
conscious
state
is
intentionally
directed
at
an
object
outside
itself
—
such
as
a
tree
or
chair
in
the
case
of
a
conscious
perception
—
as
well
as
intentionally
directed
at
itself
one
and
the
same
state
is
both
an
outerdirected
awareness
and
an
awareness
of
itself
several
recent
theories
have
claimed
that
such
reflexive
awareness
is

central
feature

representationalist
theories
almost
all
theories
of
consciousness
regard
it
as
having
representational
features
but
so
called
representationalist
theories
are
defined
by
the
stronger
view
that
its
representational
features
exhaust
its
mental
features
harman
1990
tye
1995
2000
according
to
the
representationalist
conscious
mental
states
have
no
mental
properties
other
than
their
representational
properties
thus
two
conscious
or
experiential
states
that
share
all
their
representational
properties
will
not
differ
in
any
mental
respect
the
exact
force
of
the
claim
depends
on
how
one
interprets
the
idea
of
being
“
representationally
the
same
”
for
which
there
are
many
plausible
alternative
criteria
one
could
define
it
coarsely
in
terms
of
satisfaction
or
truth
conditions
but
understood
in
that
way
the
representationalist
thesis
seems
clearly
false
there
are
too
many
ways
in
which
states
might
share
their
satisfaction
or
truth
conditions
yet
differ
mentally
including
those
that
concern
their
mode
of
conceptualizing
or
presenting
those
conditions
at
the
opposite
extreme
one
could
count
two
states
as
representationally
distinct
if
they
differed
in
any
features
that
played
a
role
in
their
representational
function
or
operation
on
such
a
liberal
reading
any
differences
in
the
bearers
of
content
would
count
as
representational
differences
even
if
they
bore
the
same
intentional
or
representational
content
they
might
differ
only
in
their
means
or
mode
of
representation
not
their
content
such
a
reading
would
of
course
increase
the
plausibility
of
the
claim
that
a
conscious
state
s
representational
properties
exhaust
its
mental
properties
but
at
the
cost
of
significantly
weakening
or
even
trivializing
the
thesis
thus
the
representationalist
seems
to
need
an
interpretation
of
representational
sameness
that
goes
beyond
mere
satisfaction
conditions
and
reflects
all
the
intentional
or
contentful
aspects
of
representation
without
being
sensitive
to
mere
differences
in
underlying
noncontentful
features
of
the
processes
at
the
realization
level
thus
most
representationalists
provide
conditions
for
conscious
experience
that
include
both
a
content
condition
plus
some
further
causal
role
or
format
requirements

other
representationalists
accept
the
existence
of
qualia
but

them
as

that
external
objects
are
represented
as
having

they
treat
them
as

properties

the

to

the
mere
logical
possibility
of
inverted

shows
that
conscious

can
differ
in
a
significant
mental
respect

narrative
interpretative
theories
some
theories
of
consciousness
stress
the
interpretative
nature
of
facts
about
consciousness
according
to
such
views
what
is
or
is
not
conscious
is
not
always
a
determinate
fact
or
at
least
not
so
independent
of
a
larger
context
of
interpretative
judgments
the
most
prominent
philosophical
example
is
the
multiple
drafts
model
mdm
of
consciousness
advanced
by
daniel
dennett
1991
it
combines
elements
of
both
representationalism
and
higherorder
theory
but
does
so
in
a
way
that
varies
interestingly
from
the
more
standard
versions
of
either
providing
a
more
interpretational
and
less
strongly
realist
view
of
consciousness
the
mdm
includes
many
distinct
but
interrelated
features
its
name
reflects
the
fact
that
at
any
given
moment
content
fixations
of
many
sorts
are
occurring
throughout
the
brain
what
makes
some
of
these
contents
conscious
is
not
that
they
occur
in
a
privileged
spatial
or
functional
location
—
the
so
called
“
cartesian
theater
”
—
nor
in
a
special
mode
or
format
all
of
which
the
mdm
denies
rather
it
a
matter
of
what
dennett
calls
“
cerebral
celebrity
”
i
e
the
degree
to
which
a
given
content
influences
the
future
development
of
other
contents
throughout
the
brain
especially
with
regard
to
how
those
effects
are
manifest
in
the
reports
and
behaviors
that
the
person
makes
in
response
to
various
probes
that
might
indicate
her
conscious
state
one
of
the
mdm
s
key
claims
is
that
different
probes
e
g
being
asked
different
questions
or
being
in
different
contexts
that
make
differing
behavioral
demands
may
elicit
different
answers
about
the
person
s
conscious
state
moreover
according
to
the
mdm
there
may
be
no
probeindependent
fact
of
the
matter
about
what
the
person
s
conscious
state
really
was
hence
the
“
multiple
”
of
the
multiple
drafts
model
the
mdm
is
representationalist
in
that
it
analyzes
consciousness
in
terms
of
content
relations
it
also
denies
the
existence
of
qualia
and
thus
rejects
any
attempt
to
distinguish
conscious
states
from
nonconscious
states
by
their
presence
it
rejects
as
well
the
notion
of
the
self
as
an
inner
observer
whether
located
in
the
cartesian
theater
or
elsewhere
the
mdm
treats
the
self
as
an
emergent
or
virtual
aspect
of
the
coherent
roughly
serially
narrative
that
is
constructed
through
the
interactive
play
of
contents
in
the
system
many
of
those
contents
are
bound
together
at
the
intentional
level
as
perceptions
or
fixations
from
a
relatively
unified
and
temporally
extended
point
of
view
i
e
they
cohere
in
their
contents
as
if
they
were
the
experiences
of
a
ongoing
self
but
it
is
the
order
of
dependence
that
is
crucial
to
the
mdm
account
the
relevant
contents
are
not
unified
because
they
are
all
observed
by
a
single
self
but
just
the
converse
it
is
because
they
are
unified
and
coherent
at
the
level
of
content
that
they
count
as
the
experiences
of
a
single
self
at
least
of
a
single
virtual
self
it
is
in
this
respect
that
the
mdm
shares
some
elements
with
higherorder
theories
the
contents
that
compose
the
serial
narrative
are
at
least
implicitly
those
of
an
ongoing
if
virtual
self
and
it
is
they
that
are
most
likely
to
be
expressed
in
the
reports
the
person
makes
of
her
conscious
state
in
response
to
various
probes
they
thus
involve
a
certain
degree
of
reflexivity
or
selfawareness
of
the
sort
that
is
central
to
higherorder
theories
but
the
higherorder
aspect
is
more
an
implicit
feature
of
the
stream
of
contents
rather
than
present
in
distinct
explicit
higherorder
states
of
the
sort
found
in
standard
ho
theories
dennett
s
mdm
has
been
highly
influential
but
has
also
drawn
criticism
especially
from
those
who
find
it
insufficiently
realist
in
its

of

the

has
introduced
the
idea
of
an
“

based
in
the

that
makes
sense
of

in

constructs

cognitive
theories
a
number
theories
of
consciousness
associate
it
with
a
distinct
cognitive
architecture
or
with
a
special
pattern
of
activity
with
that
structure
global
workspace
a
major
psychological
example
of
the
cognitive
approach
is
the
global
workspace
theory
as
initially
developed
by
bernard
baars
1988
global
workspace
theory
describes
consciousness
in
terms
of
a
competition
among
processors
and
outputs
for
a
limited
capacity
resource
that
“
broadcasts
”
information
for
widespread
access
and
use
being
available
in
that
way
to
the
global
workspace
makes
information
conscious
at
least
in
the
access
sense
it
is
available
for
report
and
the
flexible
control
of
behavior
much
like
dennett
s
“
cerebral
celebrity
”
being
broadcast
in
the
workspace
makes
contents
more
accessible
and
influential
with
respect
to
other
contents
and
other
processors
at
the
same
time
the
original
content
is
strengthened
by
recurrent
support
back
from
the
workspace
and
from
other
contents
with
which
it
coheres
the
capacity
limits
on
the
workspace
correspond
to
the
limits
typically
placed
on
focal
attention
or
working
memory
in
many
cognitive
models
the
model
has
been
further
developed
with
proposed
connections
to
particular
neural
and
functional
brain
systems
by
stanislas
dehaene
and
others
2000
of
special
importance
is
the
claim
that
consciousness
in
both
the
access
and
phenomenal
sense
occurs
when
and
only
when
the
relevant
content
enters
the
larger
global
network
involving
both
primary
sensory
areas
as
well
as
many
other
areas
including
frontal
and
parietal
areas
associated
with
attention
dehaene
claims
that
conscious
perception
begins
only
with
the
“
ignition
”
of
that
larger
global

in
the
primary
sensory
areas
will
not
suffice

the

a

both

it

which

we

our

however
a
proposal
by
the
neuroscientist
giulio
tononi
2008
goes
further
in
identifying
consciousness
with
integrated
information
and
asserting
that
information
integration
of
the
relevant
sort
is
both
necessary
and
sufficient
for
consciousness
regardless
of
the
substrate
in
which
it
is
realized
which
need
not
be
neural
or
biological
according
to
tononi
s
integrated
information
theory
iit
consciousness
is
a
purely
informationtheoretic
property
of
systems
he
proposes
a
mathematical
measure
φ
that
aims
to
measure
not
merely
the
information
in
the
parts
of
a
given
system
but
also
the
information
contained
in
the
organization
of
the
system
over
and
above
that
in
its
parts
φ
thus
corresponds
to
the
system
s
degree
of
informational
integration
such
a
system
can
contain
many
overlapping
complexes
and
the
complex
with
the
highest
φ
value
will
be
conscious
according
to
iit
according
to
iit
consciousness
varies
in
quantity
and
comes
in
many
degrees
which
correspond
to
φ
values
thus
even
a
simple
system
such
a
single
photo
diode
will
be
conscious
to
some
degree
if
it
is
not
contained
within
a
larger
complex
in
that
sense
iit
implies
a
form
of
panpsychism
that
tononi
explicitly
endorses
according
to
iit
the
quality
of
the
relevant
consciousness
is
determined
by
the
totality
of
informational
relations
within
the
relevant
integrated
complex
thus
iit
aims
to
explain
both
the
quantity
and
quality
of
phenomenal
consciousness

neural
theories
neural
theories
of
consciousness
come
in
many
forms
though
most
in
some
way
concern
the
so
called
“
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
”
or
nccs
unless
one
is
a
dualist
or
other
nonphysicalist
more
than
mere
correlation
is
required
at
least
some
nccs
must
be
the
essential
substrates
of
consciousness
an
explanatory
neural
theory
needs
to
explain
why
or
how
the
relevant
correlations
exist
and
if
the
theory
is
committed
to
physicalism
that
will
require
showing
how
the
underlying
neural
substrates
could
be
identical
with
their
neural
correlates
or
at
least
realize
them
by
satisfying
the
required
roles

conditions

quantum
theories
other
physical
theories
have
gone
beyond
the
neural
and
placed
the
natural
locus
of
consciousness
at
a
far
more
fundamental
level
in
particular
at
the
microphysical
level
of
quantum
phenomena
according
to
such
theories
the
nature
and
basis
of
consciousness
can
not
be
adequately
understood
within
the
framework
of
classical
physics
but
must
be
sought
within
the
alternative
picture
of
physical
reality
provided
by
quantum
mechanics
the
proponents
of
the
quantum
consciousness
approach
regard
the
radically
alternative
and
often
counterintuitive
nature
of
quantum
physics
as
just
what
is
needed
to
overcome
the
supposed
explanatory
obstacles
that
confront
more
standard
attempts
to
bridge
the
psychophysical
gap
again
there
are
a
wide
range
of
specific
theories
and
models
that
have
been
proposed
appealing
to
a
variety
of
quantum
phenomena
to
explain
a
diversity
of
features
of
consciousness
it
would
be
impossible
to
catalog
them
here
or
even
explain
in
any
substantial
way
the
key
features
of
quantum
mechanics
to
which
they
appeal
however
a
brief
selective
survey
may
provide
a
sense
however
partial
and
obscure
of
the
options
that
have
been
proposed
the
physicist
roger
penrose
1989
1994
and
the
anesthesiologist
stuart
hameroff
1998
have
championed
a
model
according
to
which
consciousness
arises
through
quantum
effects
occurring
within
subcellular
structures
internal
to
neurons
known
as
microtubules
the
model
posits
so
called
“
objective
collapses
”
which
involve
the
quantum
system
moving
from
a
superposition
of
multiple
possible
states
to
a
single
definite
state
but
without
the
intervention
of
an
observer
or
measurement
as
in
most
quantum
mechanical
models
according
to
the
penrose
and
hameroff
the
environment
internal
to
the
microtubules
is
especially
suitable
for
such
objective
collapses
and
the
resulting
selfcollapses
produce
a
coherent
flow
regulating
neuronal
activity
and
making
nonalgorithmic
mental
processes
possible
the
psychiatrist
ian
marshall
has
offered
a
model
that
aims
to
explain
the
coherent
unity
of
consciousness
by
appeal
to
the
production
within
the
brain
of
a
physical
state
akin
to
that
of
a
boseeinstein
condensate
the
latter
is
a
quantum
phenomenon
in
which
a
collection
of
atoms
acts
as
a
single
coherent
entity
and
the
distinction
between
discrete
atoms
is
lost
while
brain
states
are
not
literally
examples
of
boseeinstein
condensates
reasons
have
been
offered
to
show
why
brains
are
likely
to
give
rise
to
states
that
are
capable
of
exhibiting
a
similar
coherence
marshall
and
zohar
1990
a
basis
for
consciousness
has
also
been
sought
in
the
holistic
nature
of
quantum
mechanics
and
the
phenomenon
of
entanglement
according
to
which
particles
that
have
interacted
continue
to
have
their
natures
depend
upon
each
other
even
after
their
separation
unsurprisingly
these
models
have
been
targeted
especially
at
explaining
the
coherence
of
consciousness
but
they
have
also
been
invoked
as
a
more
general
challenge
to
the
atomistic
conception
of
traditional
physics
according
to
which
the
properties
of
wholes
are
to
be
explained
by
appeal
to
the
properties
of
their
parts
plus
their
mode
of
combination
a
method
of
explanation
that
might
be
regarded
as
unsuccessful
to
date
in
explaining
consciousness
silberstein
1998
2001
others
have
taken
quantum
mechanics
to
indicate
that
consciousness
is
an
absolutely
fundamental
property
of
physical
reality
one
that
needs
to
be
brought
in
at
the
very
most
basic
level
stapp
1993
they
have
appealed
especially
to
the
role
of
the
observer
in
the
collapse
of
the
wave
function
i
e
the
collapse
of
quantum
reality
from
a
superposition
of
possible
states
to
a
single
definite
state
when
a
measurement
is
made
such
models
may
or
may
not
embrace
a
form
of
quasiidealism
in
which
the
very
existence
of
physical
reality
depends
upon
its
being
consciously
observed
there
are
many
other
quantum
models
of
consciousness
to
be
found
in
the
literature
—
some
advocating
a
radically
revisionist
metaphysics
and
others
not
—
but
these
four
provide
a
reasonable
though
partial
sample
of
the
alternatives
9

nonphysical
theories
most
specific
theories
of
consciousness
—
whether
cognitive
neural
or
quantum
mechanical
—
aim
to
explain
or
model
consciousness
as
a
natural
feature
of
the
physical
world
however
those
who
reject
a
physicalist
ontology
of
consciousness
must
find
ways
of
modeling
it
as
a
nonphysical
aspect
of
reality
thus
those
who
adopt
a
dualist
or
antiphysicalist
metaphysical
view
must
in
the
end
provide
specific
models
of
consciousness
different
from
the
five
types
above
both
substance
dualists
and
property
dualists
must
develop
the
details
of
their
theories
in
ways
that
articulate
the
specific
natures
of
the
relevant
nonphysical
features
of
reality
with
which
they
equate
consciousness
or
to
which
they
appeal
in
order
to
explain
it
a
variety
of
such
models
have
been
proposed
including
the
following
david
chalmers
1996
has
offered
an
admittedly
speculative
version
of
panpsychism
which
appeals
to
the
notion
of
information
not
only
to
explain
psychophysical
invariances
between
phenomenal
and
physically
realized
information
spaces
but
also
to
possibly
explain
the
ontology
of
the
physical
as
itself
derived
from
the
informational
a
version
of
“
it
from
bit
”
theory
in
a
somewhat
similar
vein
gregg
rosenberg
has
2004
proposed
an
account
of
consciousness
that
simultaneously
addresses
the
ultimate
categorical
basis
of
causal
relations
in
both
the
causal
case
and
the
conscious
case
rosenberg
argues
the
relationalfunctional
facts
must
ultimately
depend
upon
a
categorical
nonrelational
base
and
he
offers
a
model
according
to
which
causal
relations
and
qualitative
phenomenal
facts
both
depend
upon
the
same
base
also
as
noted
just
above
section
9
8
some
quantum
theories
treat
consciousness
as
a
fundamental
feature
of
reality
stapp
1993
and
insofar
as
they
do
so
they
might
be
plausibly
classified
as
nonphysical
theories
as
well
10
conclusion
a
comprehensive
understanding
of
consciousness
will
likely
require
theories
of
many
types
one
might
usefully
and
without
contradiction
accept
a
diversity
of
models
that
each
in
their
own
way
aim
respectively
to
explain
the
physical
neural
cognitive
functional
representational
and
higherorder
aspects
of
consciousness
there
is
unlikely
to
be
any
single
theoretical
perspective
that
suffices
for
explaining
all
the
features
of
consciousness
that
we
wish
to
understand
thus
a
synthetic
and
pluralistic
approach
may
provide
the
best
road
to
future
progress

activism

awareness
campaigns
consciousness
raising
also
called
awareness
raising
is
a
form
of
activism
popularized
by
united
states
feminists
in
the
late
1960s
it
often
takes
the
form
of
a
group
of
people
attempting
to
focus
the
attention
of
a
wider
group
on
some
cause
or
condition
common

include
diseases
e

breast
cancer
aids
conflicts
e
g
the
darfur
genocide
global

movements
e
g
greenpeace
peta
earth
hour
and
political
parties
or
politicians
since
informing
the
populace
of
a
public
concern
is
often
regarded
as
the
first
step
to
changing
how
the
institutions
handle
it
raising
awareness
is
often
the
first
activity
in
which
any
advocacy
group
engages
however
in
practice
raising
awareness
is
often
combined
with
other
activities
such
as
fundraising
membership
drives
or
advocacy
in
order
to
harness
andor
sustain
the
motivation
of
new
supporters
which
may
be
at
its
highest
just
after
they
have
learned
and
digested
the
new
information
the
term
awareness
raising
is
used
in
the
yogyakarta
principles
against
discriminatory
attitudes1
and
lgbt
stereotypes
as
well
as
the
convention
on
the
rights
of
persons
with
disabilities
to
combat
stereotypes
prejudices
and
harmful
practices
toward
people
with
disabilities

terminology
edit
until
the
early17th
century
english
speakers
used
the
word
consciousness
in
the
sense
of
moral
knowledge
of
right
or
wrong
—
a
concept
today
referred
to
as
conscience
3

consciousness
raising
groups
were
formed
by
new
york
radical
women
an
early
women
s
liberation
group
in
new
york
city
and
quickly
spread
throughout
the
united
states
in
november
1967
a
group
including
shulamith
firestone
anne
koedt
kathie
sarachild
originally
kathie
amatniek
and
carol
hanisch
began
meeting
in
koedt
s
apartment
meetings
often
involved
going
around
the
room
and
talking
about
issues
in
their
own
lives
the
phrase
consciousness
raising
was
coined
to
describe
the
process
when
kathie
sarachild
took
up
the
phrase
from
anne
forer
in
the
old
left
they
used
to
say
that
the
workers
don
t
know
they
re
oppressed
so
we
have
to
raise
their
consciousness
one
night
at
a
meeting
i
said
would
everybody
please
give
me
an
example
from
their
own
life
on
how
they
experienced
oppression
as
a
woman
i
need
to
hear
it
to
raise
my
own
consciousness
kathie
was
sitting
behind
me
and
the
words
rang
in
her
mind
from
then
on
she
sort
of
made
it
an
institution
and
called
it
consciousnessraising
—
anne
forer4
on
thanksgiving
1968
kathie
sarachild
presented
a
program
for
feminist
consciousness
raising
at
the
first
national
women
s
liberation
conference
near
chicago
illinois
in
which
she
explained
the
principles
behind
consciousnessraising
and
outlined
a
program
for
the
process
that
the
new
york
groups
had
developed
over
the
past
year
groups
founded
by
former
members
of
new
york
radical
women
—
in
particular
redstockings
founded
out
of
the
breakup
of
the
nyrw
in
1969
and
new
york
radical
feminists
—
promoted
consciousness
raising
and
distributed
mimeographed
sheets
of
suggesting
topics
for
consciousness
raising
group
meetings
new
york
radical
feminists
organized
neighborhoodbased
c
r
groups
in
manhattan
brooklyn
and
queens
involving
as
many
as
four
hundred
women
in
c
r
groups
at
its
peak
5
over
the
next
few
years
smallgroup
consciousness
raising
spread
rapidly
in
cities
and
suburbs
throughout
the
united
states
by
1971
the
chicago
women
s
liberation
union
which
had
already
organized
several
consciousness
raising
groups
in
chicago
described
small
consciousness
raising
groups
as
the
backbone
of
the
women
s
liberation
movement
6
susan
brownmiller
a
member
of
the
west
villagea
would
later
write
that
smallgroup
consciousness
raising
was
the
movement
s
most
successful
form
of
female
bonding
and
the
source
of
most
of
its
creative
thinking
some
of
the
small
groups
stayed
together
for
more
than
a
decade
7
in
1973
probably
the
height
of
cr
100000
women
in
the
united
states
belonged
to
cr
groups
8
early
midcentury
feminists
argued
that
women
were
isolated
from
each
other
and
as
a
result
many
problems
in
women
s
lives
were
misunderstood
as
personal
or
as
the
results
of
conflicts
between
the
personalities
of
individual
men
and
women
rather
than
systematic
forms
of
oppression
raising
consciousness
meant
helping
oneself
and
helping
others
to
become
politically
conscious
consciousness
raising
groups
aimed
to
get
a
better
understanding
of
women
s
oppression
by
bringing
women
together
to
discuss
and
analyze
their
lives
without
interference
from
the
presence
of
men
9
while
explaining
the
theory
behind
consciousness
raising
in
a
1973
talk
kathie
sarachild
remarked
that
from
the
beginning
of
consciousnessraising
 
there
has
been
no
one
method
of
raising
consciousness
what
really
counts
in
consciousnessraising
are
not
methods
but
results
the
only
methods
of
consciousness
raising
are
essentially
principles
they
are
the
basic
radical
political
principles
of
going
to
the
original
sources
both
historic
and
personal
going
to
people
—
women
themselves
and
going
to
experience
for
theory
and
strategy
10
however
most
consciousness
raising
groups
did
follow
a
similar
pattern
for
meeting
and
discussion
meetings
would
usually
be
held
about
once
a
week
with
a
small
group
of
women
often
in
the
living
room
of
one
of
the
members
meetings
were
womenonly
and
usually
involved
going
around
the
room
for
each
woman
to
talk
about
a
predetermined
subject
—
for
example
when
you
think
about
having
a
child
would
you
rather
have
a
boy
or
a
girl
citation
needed
—
speaking
from
her
own
experience
with
no
formal
leader
for
the
discussion
and
few
rules
for
directing
or
limiting
discussion
some
c
r
groups
did
implement
rules
designed
to
give
every
woman
a
chance
to
speak
to
prevent
interruptions
etc
speaking
from
personal
experience
was
used
as
a
basis
for
further
discussion
and
analysis
based
on
the
firsthand
knowledge
that
was
shared
citation
needed
some
feminist
advocates
of
consciousness
raising
argued
that
the
process
allowed
women
to
analyze
the
conditions
of
their
own
lives
and
to
discover
ways
in
which
what
had
seemed
like
isolated
individual
problems
such
as
needing
an
abortion
surviving
rape
conflicts
between
husbands
and
wives
over
housework
etc
actually
reflected
common
conditions
faced
by
all
women
citation
needed
as
sarachild
wrote
in
1969
we
assume
that
our
feelings
are
telling
us
something
from
which
we
can
learn
that
our
feelings
mean
something
worth
analyzing
that
our
feelings
are
saying
something
political
something
reflecting
fear
that
something
bad
will
happen
to
us
or
hope
desire
knowledge
that
something
good
will
happen
to
us
in
our
groups
let
s
share
our
feelings
and
pool
them
let
s
let
ourselves
go
and
see
where
our
feelings
lead
us
our
feelings
will
lead
us
to
ideas
and
then
to
actions
11
ellen
willis
wrote
in
1984
that
consciousness
raising
has
often
been
misunderstood
and
disparaged
as
a
form
of
therapy
but
that
it
was
in
fact
in
its
time
and
context
the
primary
method
of
understanding
women
s
condition
and
constituted
the
movement
s
most
successful
organizing
tool
at
the
same
time
she
saw
the
lack
of
theory
and
emphasis
on
personal
experience
as
concealing
prior
political
and
philosophical
assumptions
12
however
some
in
the
feminist
movement
criticised
consciousness
raising
groups
as
trivial
and
apolitical
13
through
poetry
edit
historically
poetry
has
been
used
as
a
consciousnessraising
tactic
by
consciousnessraising
groups
14
activist
and
writer
audre
lorde
was
noted
to
have
been
one
of
many
scholars
who
wrote
of
poetry
as
a
means
of
communication
for
women
of
color
activist
and
resistance
groups
15
this
focus
has
also
been
studied
by
other
feminist
scholars
as
a
new
approach
to
women
s
literary
writing
experience16
and
the
usage
of
critical
consciousness
through
the
creation
of
art
as
a
liberatory
praxis
17
art
as
a
liberatory
praxis
has
also
been
explored
through
a
radical
queer
lens
through
a
number
of
publications
and
journals
such
as
sinister
wisdom18
and
conditions19
online
publications
with
an
emphasis
on
lesbian
writing
for
lgbt
rights
edit
in
the
1960s
consciousnessraising
caught
on
with
gay
liberation
activists20
who
formed
the
first
comingout
groups
which
helped
participants
come
out
of
the
closet
among
welcoming
tolerant
individuals
and
share
personal
stories
about
coming
out
the
idea
of
coming
out
as
a
tool
of
consciousnessraising
had
been
preceded
by
even
earlier
opinions
from
german
theorists
such
as
magnus
hirschfeld
iwan
bloch
and
karl
heinrich
ulrichs
all
of
whom
saw
selfdisclosure
as
a
means
of
selfemancipation
the
raising
of
consciousness
among
fellow
uncloseted
individuals
and
a
means
of
raising
awareness
in
the
wider
society
citation
needed
in
atheism
edit
in
the
god
delusion
antireligion
activist
richard
dawkins
uses
the
term
consciousness
raising
for
several
other
things
explicitly
describing
these
as
analogous
to
the
feminist
case
21
these
include
replacing
references
to
children
as
catholic
muslim
etc
with
references
to
children
of
the
adults
who
are
members
of
these
religions
which
he
compares
to
our
using
nonsexist
terminology
and
darwin
as
raising
our
consciousness
in
biology
to
the
possibility
of
explaining
complexity
naturalistically
and
in
principle
raising
our
consciousness
to
the
possibility
of
doing
such
things
elsewhere
especially
in
physics
21
earlier
in
the
book
he
uses
the
term
without
explicitly
referring
to
feminism
to
refer
to
making
people
aware
that
leaving
their
parents
faith
is
an
option

consciousness
is
the
individual
awareness
of
your
unique
thoughts
memories
feelings
sensations
and
environments
essentially
your
consciousness
is
your
awareness
of
yourself
and
the
world
around
you
this
awareness
is
subjective
and
unique
to
you
if
you
can
describe
something
you
are
experiencing
in
words
then
it
is
part
of
your
consciousness
your
conscious
experiences
are
constantly
shifting
and
changing
for
example
in
one
moment
you
may
be
focused
on
reading
this
article
your
consciousness
may
then
shift
to
the
memory
of
a
conversation
you
had
earlier
with
a
coworker
next
you
might
notice
how
uncomfortable
your
chair
is
or
maybe
you
are
mentally
planning
dinner
this
evershifting
stream
of
thoughts
can
change
dramatically
from
one
moment
to
the
next
but
your
experience
of
it
seems
smooth
and
effortless
states
of
consciousness
the
various
states
of
consciousness
include
dreams
hallucinations
hypnosis
meditation
sleep
states
induced
by
psychoactive
drugs
the
two
normal
states
of
awareness
are
consciousness
and
unconsciousness
higher
states
of
consciousness
are
often
associated
with
spiritual
or
mystical
experiences
it
involves
an
elevated
state
of
awareness
where
people
are
able
to
gain
a
greater
sense
of
themselves
their
role
and
the
world
examples
of
this
include
transcendence
meditation
mindfulness

altered

include
coma

doctors
and
healthcare
professionals
use
various
assessments
to
measure

consciousness
has

it

consciousness
is
an
essential
state
in
philosophy
spirituality
and

all
of
these
require
selfawareness
which
is
impossible
without

changes
in

understanding
different
levels
of
consciousness
can
help
healthcare
professionals
spot
signs
that
someone
might
be
experiencing
a
problem
some
of
these
changes
occur
naturally
others
are
the
result
of
factors
such
as
drugs
or
brain
damage
changes
to
consciousness
also
can
cause
changes
to
perception
thinking
understanding
and
interpretations
of

changes
in
consciousness
can
sometimes
be
a
sign
of
medical
conditions
or
they
may
even
be
a
sign
of
an
immediate
medical
emergency
for
example
sudden

might
be

worse
history
of
consciousness
for
thousands
of
years
the
study
of
human
consciousness
was
largely
the
work
of
philosophers
the
french
philosopher
rene
descartes
introduced
the
concept
of
mindbody
dualism
or
the
idea
that
while
the
mind
and
body
are
separate
they
do
interact
once
psychology
was
established
as
a
discipline
separate
from
philosophy
and
biology
the
study
of
the
conscious
experience
became
one
of
the
first
topics
studied
by
early
psychologists
structuralists
used
a
process
known
as
introspection
to
analyze
and
report
conscious
sensations
thoughts
and
experiences
trained
observers
would
carefully
inspect
the
contents
of
their
own
minds
obviously
this
was
a
very
subjective
process
but
it
helped
inspire
further
research
on
the
scientific
study
of
consciousness
the
american
psychologist
william
james
compared
consciousness
to
a
stream
—
unbroken
and
continuous
despite
constant
shifts
and
changes
psychoanalyst
sigmund
freud
focused
on
understanding
the
importance
of
the
unconscious
and
conscious
mind
while
the
focus
of
much
of
the
research
in
psychology
shifted
to
purely
observable
behaviors
during
the
first
half
of
the
20th
century
research
on
human
consciousness
has
grown
tremendously
since
the
1950s
theories
of
consciousness
one
of
the
problems
with
the
study
of
consciousness
is
the
lack
of
a
universally
accepted
operational
definition
descartes
proposed
the
idea
of
cogito
ergo
sum
i
think
therefore
i
am
which
suggested
that
the
very
act
of
thinking
demonstrates
the
reality
of
one
s
existence
and
consciousness
today
consciousness
is
generally
defined
as
an
awareness
of
yourself
and
the
world
however
there
are
still
debates
about
the
different
aspects
of
this
awareness
research
on
consciousness
has
focused
on
understanding
the
neuroscience
behind
our
conscious
experiences
scientists
have
even
utilized
brainscanning
technology
to
seek
out
specific
neurons
that
might
be
linked
to
different
conscious
events
modern
researchers
have
proposed
two
major
theories
of
consciousness
integrated
information
theory
and
global
workspace
theory
integrated
information
theory
this
approach
looks
at
consciousness
by
learning
more
about
the
physical
processes
that
underlie
our
conscious
experiences
the
theory
attempts
to
create
a
measure
of
the
integrated
information
that
forms
consciousness
the
quality
of
an
organism
s
consciousness
is
represented
by
the
level
of
integration
this
theory
tends
to
focus
on
whether
something
is
conscious
and
to
what
degree
it
is
conscious
global
workspace
theory
this
theory
suggests
that
we
have
a
memory
bank
from
which
the
brain
draws
information
to
form
the
experience
of
conscious
awareness
﻿
﻿
while
integrated
information
theory
focuses
more
on
identifying
whether
an
organism
is
conscious
the
global
workspace
theory
offers
a
much
broader
approach
to
understanding
how
consciousness
works
the
different
states
of
consciousness
summary
while
consciousness
has
intrigued
philosophers
and
scientists
for
thousands
of
years
experts
clearly
have
a
long
way
to
go
in
our
understanding
of
the
concept
researchers
continue
to
explore
the
different
bases
of
consciousness
including
the
physical
social
cultural
and
psychological
influences
that
contribute
to
our
conscious
awareness
the
role
the

although
a

must
always
obey
the
certain
judgments
of
his

he
might
be
in
ignorance
and
make
erroneous
judgments
sometimes
the

is
to

for
having
an

conscience
because
he
took
no

in

he

consciousness
is
the
active
and
subjective
experiencing
aspect
of
an
experience
consciousness
is
what
transforms
a
biochemical
state
into
an
experience
although
we
have
mapped
brain
activity
to
specific
conscious
perceptions
we
still
don
t
know
how
this
gives
rise
to
conscious
experiences
consciousness
is
what
we
are
most
familiar
with
feeling
the
sun
s
warmth
on
our
face
the
joy
of
seeing
someone
we
love
or
the
thrill
of
being
on
a
rollercoaster
—
every
single
experience
we
ever
had
from
sensations
to
thoughts
and
emotions
is
linked
to
consciousness
it
seems
paradoxical
but
despite
being
at
the
centre
of
every
experience
consciousness
is
difficult
to
define
and
still
poorly
understood
scientifically
we
know
more
about
distant
galaxies
and
the
deepest
ocean
regions
than
we
do
about
our
consciousness
even
though
consciousness
has
been
discussed
by
philosophers
for
millennia
and
has
become
an
active
and
thriving
field
of
scientific
research
it
remains
largely
a
mystery
–
but
a
strange
mystery
one
that
we
may
not
understand
well
but
are
intimately
acquainted
with
so
what
exactly
is
consciousness
many
have
tried
to
answer
this
seemingly
simple
question
i
will
cover
most
of
the
influential
views
on
this
blog
but
a
universally
agreedupon
definition
still
seems
elusive
let
s
start
our
exploration
with
a
trip
to
the
dentist
experiencing
an
experience
local
anesthesia
can
make
dental
surgery
a
lot
more
bearable
specialised
neurons
that
detect
pain
called
nociceptors
still
respond
even
when
under
local
anesthesia
and
try
to
send
out
signals
to
alert
the
brain
to
tissue
damage
inside
the
mouth
while
some
local
anesthetics
reduce
nociceptor
activity
many
function
by
blocking
these
signals
from
being
passed
on
so
that
the
message
never
reaches
the
brain
another
example
of
this
is
spinal
epidural
anesthesia
where
the
signaling
pathway
is
blocked
in
the
spinal
cord
rather
than
at
the
source
nociceptors
olschewski
et
al
1998
the
tissue
damage
in
the
mouth
is
simply
a
biological
state
and
any
nociceptor
response
is
just
a
biochemical
reaction
an
event
or
an
occurrence
without
any
associated
experience
when
we
bite
into
a
juicy
apple
after
recovering
from
our
dental
surgery
our
minds
cannot
directly
interact
with
the
apple
whatever
the
mind
may
be
it
cannot
directly
taste
the
sweetness
sense
the
crunchy
texture
or
smell
the
chemicals
released
into
the
air
we
need
the
complex
sensory
machinery
inside
our
bodies
to
pick
up
on
these
things
encode
them
into
neural
signals
and
send
them
to
the
brain
when
the
upward
signaling
is
interrupted
like
it
was
by
the
local
anesthesia
at
the
dentist
all
of
this
is
merely
a
physiological
state
or
a
unique
biochemical
configuration
of
our
bodies
however
if
these
signals
reach
our
brains
when
awake
and
focused
something
extraordinary
happens
the
biological
signals
trigger
a
subjective
conscious
experience
we
still
don
t
know
much
about
how
or
why
this
happens
but
consciousness
lives
on
as
an
indisputable
aspect
of
our
minds
although
mysterious
it
is
also
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
meaningful
aspects
of
our
human
experience
it
makes
life
worth
living
and
gives
us
an
innate
sense
of
value
and
worth
there
are
no
laws
against
throwing
a
rock
but
very
strict
laws
against
throwing
rocks
at
a
human
being
the
simple
reason
is
that
unlike
rocks
—
as
far
as
we
know
—
human
beings
have
the
capacity
to
experience
both
pain
and
joy
all
human
rights
and
the
famous
unalienable
right
to
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
found
in
the
u
s
declaration
of
independence
are
based
on
the
human
capacity
to
have
experiences
consciousness
is
the
basis
for
our
experiences
and
undergirds
all
of
this
in
its
most
basic
sense
consciousness
is
linked
to
experience
in
a
way
it
turns
a
state
of
the
world
or
a
specific
configuration
of
atoms
molecules
organs
and
everything
else
into
an
experience
another
way
to
look
at
it
is
as
the
active
experiencing
of
an
experience

towards
neural
correlate
and
back
to
experience
several
decades
of
thriving
research
have
uncovered
much
of
what
lies
behind
our
conscious
experiences
such
as
the
complex
and
intricate
brain
processes
required
to
piece
together
what
we
sense
coherently
even
decoding
a
sound
s
origin
in
threedimensional
space
requires
complex
computation
within
a
specialised
neural
architecture
yet
we
are
not
directly
aware
of
any
of
these
myriad
operations
that
are
going
on
behind
the
scenes
and
effortlessly
turn
toward
the
direction
of
a
loud
sound
these
fascinating
insights
can
describe
the
brain
activity
associated
with
specific
conscious
perception
forms
in
great
detail
we
already
have
a
rich
catalogue
of
such
neural
correlates
and
new
findings
are
frequently
added
the
problem
is
that
while
neural
correlates
highlight
the
brain
s
necessary
work
in
the
background
that
makes
specific
conscious
experiences
possible
they
fail
to
explain
such
experiences
themselves
the
processes
are
unconscious
and
even
the
results
can
often
be
unconscious
like
when
we
are
distracted
or
when
a
stronger
stimulus
overrides
another
in
those
cases
the
exact
same
processes
do
not
result
in
a
conscious
experience
a
rollercoaster
can
provide
a
thrilling
ride
but
if
it
runs
empty
with
no
one
riding
it
no
thrill
is
experienced
this
does
not
mean
that
there
is
a
little
person
inside
watching
the
“
theatre
of
the
mind
”
—
what
the
british
philosopher
gilbert
ryle
19492002
mockingly
called
“
the
dogma
of
the
ghost
in
the
machine
”
a
majority
of
scientists
and
philosophers
reject
this
notion
however
it
does
mean
that
even
though
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
are
incredibly
useful
they
don
t
fully
explain

philosophers
have
gone
as
far
as
to
suggest
that
what
is
experienced
is
an
illusion

yet
even
in
this
extreme
scenario
if
the
content
of
an
experience
is
truly
illusionary
which
few
accept
the
experience
itself
would
still
be
real
any
philosophical
psychological
or
neurobiological
theory
of
consciousness
is
incomplete
without
a
full
account
of
experiences
which
brings
us
back
to
the
act
of
experiencing
what
exactly
is
consciousness
so
what
exactly
is
consciousness
it
is
what
we
are
most
familiar
with
and
what
undergirds
every
perception
emotion
and
thought
we
have
at
the
same
time
it
is
an
elusive
notion
that
is
difficult
to
define
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
linked
to
experiences
it
is
the
subjective
and
active
aspect
the
experiencing
of
an
experience

how
the
brain
conjures
conscious
awareness
from
the
electrical
activity
of
billions
of
individual
nerve
cells
remains
one
of
the
great
unanswered
questions
of
life
each
of
us
knows
that
we
are
conscious
in
terms
of
having
thoughts
perceptions
and
feelings
but
we
are
unable
to
prove
it
to
anyone
else
only
we
have
access
to
the
mysterious
essence
that
allows
us
to
experience
those
thoughts
perceptions
and
feelings
in
the
1990s
the
philosopher
david
chalmers
described
this
inaccessibility
to
external
objective
scrutiny
as
the
“
hard
problem
”
of
consciousness
he
proposed
that
an
easier
task
for
scientists
to
tackle
would
be
its
“
neural
correlates
”
—
where
and
how
brain
activity
changes
when
people
have
conscious
experiences
apart
from
curiosity
scientists
are
most
likely
motivated
to
discover
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
in
order
to
help
diagnose
and
treat
disorders
of
consciousness
such
as
persistent
vegetative
states
and
some
psychiatric
disorders
three
dimensions
of
consciousness
consciousness
has
several
distinct
dimensions
that
they
can
measure
three
of
the
most
important
ones
are
wakefulness
or
physiological
arousal
awareness
or
the
ability
to
have
conscious
mental
experiences
including
thoughts
feelings
and
perceptions
sensory
organization
or
how
different
perceptions
and
more
abstract
concepts
become
woven
together
to
create
a
seamless
conscious
experience
these
three
dimensions
interact
to
produce
our
overall
state
of
consciousness
from
moment
to
moment
for
example
when
wide
awake
we
are
in
a
state
of
high
awareness
but
as
we
drift
off
to
sleep
at
night
both
wakefulness
and
awareness
subside
awareness
and
physiological
arousal
return
during
rem
rapid
eye
movement
sleep
which
is
when
vivid
dreams
are
mostly
likely
to
occur
but
these
sensory
experiences
are
mostly
disconnected
from
external
stimuli
and
detached
from
the
concepts
that
anchor
us
to
reality
while
we
are
awake
in
a
similar
way
altered
states
of
consciousness
such
as
those
induced
by
psychedelic
drugs
or
low
oxygen
levels
involve
normal
levels
of
arousal
but
disorganized
sensory
experiences
these
can
include
hallucinations
of
sounds
smells
or
sights
but
also
synesthesia
when
there
is
crosstalk
between
usually
discrete
senses
such
as
sounds
that
evoke
visual
experiences
people
in
a
coma
or
under
anesthesia
can
have
levels
of
wakefulness
and
awareness
that
are
even
lower
than
during
nonrem
sleep
meanwhile
in
a
strange
hybrid
state
of
consciousness
known
as
unresponsive
wakefulness
syndrome
or
a
vegetative
state
patients
undergo
daily
cycles
of
sleep
and
wakefulness
but
without
showing
any
sign
of
awareness
despite
spending
long
periods
with
their
eyes
open
they
do
not
exhibit
behavioral
responses
to
external
stimuli
some
of
these
patients
will
recover
limited
signs
of
awareness
known
as
a
“
minimally
conscious
state
”
such
as
the
ability
to
respond
to
instructions
or
follow
a
moving
object
with
their
eyes
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
patients
in
different
states
of
consciousness
have
provided
vital
clues
about
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
techniques
such
as
functional
magnetic
resonance
imaging
fmri
and
electroencephalography
eeg
have
revealed
the
neural
activity
that
accompanies
these
states
scientists
detect
patterns
of
activity
through
measures
of
functional
connectivity
using
statistical
techniques
to
reveal
correlations
between
the
timing
of
neural
events
in
different
parts
of
the
brain
this
reveals
the
networks
of
brain
regions
that
are
involved
in
working
memory
attention
and
mindwandering
for
example
when
they
combine
data
from
fmri
and
eeg
researchers
discover
that
activity
deep
inside
the
brain
in
the
thalamus
varies
during
wakefulness
in
step
with
activity
in
the
default
mode
network
the
thalamus
operates
like
a
sensory
relay
station
while
the
default
mode
network
is
a
collection
of
regions
within
the
cortex
—
the
outermost
layer
of
the
brain
—
that
are
intimately
involved
in
mindwandering
and
selfawareness
by
contrast
during
nonrem
sleep
and
under
anesthetic
functional
connectivity
breaks
down
between
the
thalamus
and
the
default
mode
network
and
cortical
networks
that
are
involved
in
attention
in
disorders
of
consciousness
researchers
can
see
reduced
functional
connectivity
and
physical
damage
that
affects
the
connections
between
the
cortex
and
deep
brain
structures
this
demonstrates
how
important
these
connections
are
for
maintaining
wakefulness
and
information
exchange
across
the
brain
the
terrain
of
brain
activity
despite
advances
in
our
understanding
of
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
however
doctors
still
have
trouble
diagnosing
patients
who
are
unable
to
respond
to
questions
or
commands
they
cannot
tell
whether
such
a
patient
is
completely
unconscious
conscious
but
disconnected
from
external
stimuli
or
conscious
and
aware
of
their
environment
but
unable
to
respond
a
completely
new
approach
reported
recently
in
nature
communications
may
provide
a
way
to
assess
such
a
patient
s
wakefulness
awareness
and
sensory
organization
rather
than
recording
the
activity
in
particular
brain
regions
or
networks
of
regions
the
new
technique
measures
gradients
of
activity
across
the
brain
this
is
analogous
to
recording
the
steepness
of
terrain
on
a
map
and
how
that
steepness
might
change
over
time
rather
than
just
the
locations
of
roads
towns
and
villages
this
innovative
way
of
investigating
brain
activity
which
considers
how
functional
geometry
shapes
temporal
dynamics
takes
into
account
the
fact
that
each
region
and
network
has
multiple
functions
and
connections
“
consciousness
is
complex
and
studying
it
is
like
solving
a
scrambled
rubik
s
cube
”
says
first
author
dr
zirui
huang
research
assistant
professor
at
the
university
of
michigan
medical
school
department
of
anesthesiology
“
if
you
look
at
just
a
single
surface
you
may
be
confused
by
the
way
it
is
organized
you
need
to
work
on
the
puzzle
looking
at
all
dimensions
”
he
adds
three
gradients
of
consciousness
dr
huang
and
his
colleagues
looked
at
how
gradients
of
neural
activity
—
as
measured
by
fmri
—
changed
with
the
three
main
dimensions
of
consciousness
arousability
or
wakefulness
awareness
sensory
integration
the
researchers
drew
on
existing
fmri
data
recorded
from
the
brains
of
people
who
were
awake
under
anesthetic
in
a
socalled
vegetative
state
—
known
as
“
unresponsive
wakefulness
syndrome
”
—
or
who
had
a
psychiatric
diagnosis
such
as
schizophrenia
they
discovered
an
activity
gradient
that
corresponded
to
changes
in
arousal
levels
that
stretched
from
the
visual
and
default
mode
areas
to
networks
involved
in
attention
another
gradient
changed
in
step
with
awareness
and
stretched
from
regions
involved
in
perception
and
action
to
regions
responsible
for
the
integration
of
information
and
formation
of
abstract
concepts
a
third
gradient
linked
to
sensory
organization
spanned
the
visual
system
and
the
somatomotor
cortex
which
helps
to
control
movement
“
we
demonstrated
that
disruptions
of
human
consciousness
—
due
to
pharmacological
neuropathological
or
psychiatric
causes
—
are
associated
with
a
degradation
of
one
or
more
of
the
major
cortical
gradients
depending
on
the
state
”
notes
dr
huang
he
told
medical
news
today
that
some
patients
who
are
unable
to
respond
in
any
way
may
still
be
conscious
“
it
is
therefore
important
to
develop
behaviorindependent
and
taskindependent
approaches
to
assessment
”
he
said
“
according
to
our
work
cortical
gradient
measurements
have
the
potential
to
reduce
the
uncertainty
of
clinical
assessment
of
consciousness
in
those
patients
”
he
added
transcranial
magnetic
stimulation
scientists
like
dr
huang
have
discovered
a
lot
about
its
neural
correlates
but
their
findings
do
not
shed
much
light
on
how
the
brain
generates
consciousness
—
the
“
hard
problem
”
other
scientists
have
argued
that
to
learn
more
about
the
causes
of
consciousness
you
have
to
manipulate
brain
activity
and
see
what
happens
transcranial
magnetic
stimulation
or
tms
is
a
noninvasive
technique
that
changes
brain
activity
in
a
tightly
controlled
way
the
technique
involves
passing
a
strong
electrical
pulse
through
a
conductive
coil
held
close
to
the
participant
s
head
creating
a
brief
magnetic
pulse
that
induces
electrical
activity
in
the
part
of
the
brain
closest
to
the
coil
this
boosts
the
electrical
activity
of
millions
of
neurons
within
a
region
just
a
few
centimeters
in
diameter
in
an
awake
participant
a
tms
pulse
triggers
a
complex
chain
of
activity
across
multiple
cortical
areas
whereas
in
nonrem
sleep
the
same
pulse
has
a
much
briefer
more
localized
effect
during
rem
sleep
however
the
pulse
evokes
a
pattern
of
activity
similar
to
that
seen
in
the
brain
of
a
person
who
is
wide
awake
intriguingly
in
patients
who
are
awake
but
in
a
vegetative
state
tms
induces
shortlived
local
effects
that
are
similar
to
those
seen
during
the
nonrem
sleep
of
a
healthy
person
but
in
the
brain
of
awake
minimally
conscious
patients
tms
evokes
a
similar
response
to
that
seen
in
healthy
awake
people
researchers
have
therefore
concluded
that
the
complexity
and
spatial
extent
of
communication
between
brain
regions
subsides
as
levels
of
wakefulness
and
awareness
fall
theories
of
consciousness
despite
advances
in
our
understanding
of
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
the
question
remains
how
does
consciousness
arise
from
brain
activity
scientists
have
proposed
several
theories
two
prominent
ideas
are
global
neuronal
workspace
theory
gnwt
and
integrated
information
theory
iit
global
neuronal
workspace
in
brief
gnwt
proposes
that
there
is
a
network
of
longrange
connections
that
span
the
brain
called
the
global
workspace
neural
information
becomes
conscious
when
it
gains
access
to
this
workspace
which
allows
it
to
be
broadcast
throughout
the
brain
including
to
specialized
hubs
for
memory
perception
motor
output
and
attention
crucially
it
is
a
case
of
“
winner
takes
all
”
for
a
particular
interpretation
of
sensory
data
when
it
gains
access
to
the
global
workspace
according
to
prof
michael
graziano
professor
of
psychology
and
neuroscience
at
the
princeton
neuroscience
institute
nj
and
dr
aaronschurger
assistant
professor
in
the
crean
college
of
health
and
behavioral
sciences
at
chapman
university
in
irvine
ca
this
explains
for
example
“
bistable
”
optical
illusions
two
examples
of
these
are
the
necker
cube
and
facevase
illusion
in
which
conscious
awareness
switches
between
two
alternative
interpretations
of
the
same
sensory
data
integrated
information
the
communication
and
integration
of
information
between
brain
regions
is
at
the
heart
of
many
theories
of
consciousness
one
of
these
iit
uses
a
complex
equation
to
calculate
an
entity
s
degree
of
consciousness
from
how
well
it
integrates
information
according
to
the
equation
even
inanimate
objects
such
as
rocks
and
teapots
have
a
glimmer
of
consciousness
this
is
in
keeping
with
the
philosophical
theory
of
panpsychism
which
proposes
that
consciousness
is
a
fundamental
property
of
all
physical
systems
how
it
feels
to
control
attention
prof
graziano
has
a
problem
with
all
these
theories
of
consciousness
he
argues
that
they
cannot
even
be
termed
theories
because
they
do
not
actually
explain
consciousness
they
only
describe
it
he
likens
this
to
the
difference
between
newton
s
law
of
gravitation
which
is
an
equation
that
calculates
gravitational
force
and
einstein
s
theory
of
general
relativity
which
explains
what
gravity
actually
is
prof
graziano
s
own
theory
of
consciousness
the
attention
schema
theory
or
ast
does
not
claim
to
have
cracked
the
hard
problem
of
consciousness
but
instead
seeks
to
explain
why
we
believe
we
are
conscious
according
to
ast
animal
brains
evolved
a
model
—
or
schema
—
of
their
current
state
of
attention
that
they
could
use
to
predict
and
control
their
ongoing
focus
of
attention
in
order
to
control
our
bodies
the
brain
uses
an
internal
model
of
our
limbs
their
location
in
space
and
how
they
work
prof
graziano
believes
the
control
of
attention
is
no
different
what
is
more
he
argues
that
the
attention
schema
leads
people
to
believe
that
they
have
an
internal
essence
—
consciousness
—
that
allows
them
to
focus
their
attention
contentfree
awareness
amazingly
expert
meditators
may
be
able
to
achieve
a
state
of
pure
awareness
free
from
any
thoughts
perceptions
feelings
or
even
a
sense
of
selfhood
time
or
space
this
special
state
of
consciousness
has
provided
more
clues
about
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
researchers
at
the
university
of
freiburg
in
germany
used
eeg
to
study
the
brain
of
a
former
buddhist
monk
who
described
this
as
a
“
clear
aware
openness
”
they
found
that
contentfree
awareness
was
associated
with
a
sharp
fall
in
alpha
waves
and
an
increase
in
theta
waves
there
was
also
a
decoupling
of
the
activity
of
the
sensory
cortex
and
dorsal
attention
network
but
strong
activity
within
the
attention
network
itself
meanwhile
there
was
a
decline
in
the
activity
of
the
default
mode
network
prof
graziano
said
contentfree
awareness
in
meditation
may
correspond
to
the
predictive
model
of
attention
described
in
his
theory
he
told
mnt
“
i
think
the
model
of
attention
representing
the
property
of
attention
itself
is
possible
to
construct
in
isolation
unassociated
with
a
thing
to
which
you
are
attending
it
may
indeed
be
the
contentfree
awareness
that
meditators
talk
about
i
do
think
that
meditation
is
essentially
practice
in
using
your
attention
schema
”
even
without
thoughts
sensations
or
feelings
it
seems
the
mysterious
essence
of
conscious
awareness
remains

more
than
400
years
ago
galileo
showed
that
many
everyday
phenomena
—
such
as
a
ball
rolling
down
an
incline
or
a
chandelier
gently
swinging
from
a
church
ceiling
—
obey
precise
mathematical
laws
for
this
insight
he
is
often
hailed
as
the
founder
of
modern
science
but
galileo
recognized
that
not
everything
was
amenable
to
a
quantitative
approach
such
things
as
colors
tastes
and
smells
“
are
no
more
than
mere
names
”
galileo
declared
for
“
they
reside
only
in
consciousness
”
these
qualities
aren
t
really
out
there
in
the
world
he
asserted
but
exist
only
in
the
minds
of
creatures
that
perceive
them
“
hence
if
the
living
creature
were
removed
”
he
wrote
“
all
these
qualities
would
be
wiped
away
and
annihilated
”
since
galileo
s
time
the
physical
sciences
have
leaped
forward
explaining
the
workings
of
the
tiniest
quarks
to
the
largest
galaxy
clusters
but
explaining
things
that
reside
“
only
in
consciousness
”
—
the
red
of
a
sunset
say
or
the
bitter
taste
of
a
lemon
—
has
proven
far
more
difficult
neuroscientists
have
identified
a
number
of
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
—
brain
states
associated
with
specific
mental
states
—
but
have
not
explained
how
matter
forms
minds
in
the
first
place
as
philosopher
colin
mcginn
put
it
in
a
1989
paper
“
somehow
we
feel
the
water
of
the
physical
brain
is
turned
into
the
wine
of
consciousness
”
philosopher
david
chalmers
famously
dubbed
this
quandary
 
the
“
hard
problem
”
of
consciousness
scholars
recently
gathered
to
debate
the
problem
at
marist
college
in
poughkeepsie
n
y
during
a
twoday
workshop
focused
on
an
idea
known
as
 
panpsychism
the
concept
proposes
that
consciousness
is
a
fundamental
aspect
of
reality
like
mass
or
electrical
charge
the
idea
goes
back
to
antiquity
—
plato
took
it
seriously
—
and
has
had
some
prominent
supporters
over
the
years
including
psychologist
william
james
and
philosopher
and
mathematician
bertrand
russell
lately
it
is
seeing
renewed
interest
especially
following
the
2019
publication
of
philosopher
philip
goff
s
book
galileo
s
error
which
argues
forcefully
for
the
idea
goff
of
the
university
of
durham
in
england
organized
the
recent
event
along
with
marist
philosopher
andrei
buckareff
and
it
was
funded
through
a
grant
from
the
john
templeton
foundation
in
a
small
lecture
hall
with
floortoceiling
windows
overlooking
the
hudson
river
roughly
two
dozen
scholars
probed
the
possibility
that
perhaps
it
s
consciousness
all
the
way
down
part
of
the
appeal
of
panpsychism
is
that
it
appears
to
provide
a
workaround
to
the
question
posed
by
chalmers
we
no
longer
have
to
worry
about
how
inanimate
matter
forms
minds
because
mindedness
was
there
all
along
residing
in
the
fabric
of
the
universe
chalmers
himself
has
embraced
a
form
of
panpsychism
and
even
suggested
that
individual
particles
might
be
somehow
aware
he
said
in
a
ted
talk
that
a
photon
“
might
have
some
element
of
raw
subjective
feeling
some
primitive
precursor
to
consciousness
”
also
on
board
with
the
idea
is
neuroscientist
christof
koch
who
noted
in
his
2012
book
consciousness
that
if
one
accepts
consciousness
as
a
real
phenomenon
that
s
not
dependent
on
any
particular
material
—
that
it
s
“
substrateindependent
”
as
philosophers
put
it
—
then
“
it
is
a
simple
step
to
conclude
that
the
entire
cosmos
is
suffused
with
sentience
”
yet
panpsychism
runs
counter
to
the
majority
view
in
both
the
physical
sciences
and
in
philosophy
that
treats
consciousness
as
an
emergent
phenomenon
something
that
arises
in
certain
complex
systems
such
as
human
brains
in
this
view
individual
neurons
are
not
conscious
but
thanks
to
the
collective
properties
of
some
86
billion
neurons
and
their
interactions
—
which
admittedly
are
still
only
poorly
understood
—
brains
along
with
bodies
perhaps
are
conscious
surveys
suggest
that
slightly
more
than
half
of
academic
philosophers
hold
this
view
known
as
“
physicalism
”
or
“
emergentism
”
whereas
about
one
third
reject
physicalism
and
lean
toward
some
alternative
of
which
panpsychism
is
one
of
several
possibilities
at
the
workshop
goff
made
the
case
that
physics
has
missed
something
essential
when
it
comes
to
our
inner
mental
life
in
formulating
their
theories
“
most
physicists
think
about
experiments
”
he
said
“
i
think
they
should
be
thinking
is
my
theory
compatible
with
consciousness
—
because
we
know
that
s
real
”
many
philosophers
at
the
meeting
appeared
to
share
goff
s
concern
that
physicalism
falters
when
it
comes
to
consciousness
“
if
you
know
every
last
detail
about
my
brain
processes
you
still
wouldn
t
know
what
it
s
like
to
be
me
”
says
hedda
hassel
mørch
a
philosopher
at
inland
norway
university
of
applied
sciences
 
“
there
is
a
clear
explanatory
gap
between
the
physical
and
the
mental
”
consider
for
example
the
difficulty
of
trying
to
describe
color
to
someone
who
has
only
seen
the
world
in
black
and
white
yanssel
garcia
a
philosopher
at
the
university
of
nebraska
omaha
believes
that
physical
facts
alone
are
inadequate
for
such
a
task
“
there
is
nothing
of
a
physical
sort
that
you
could
provide
a
person
who
sees
only
in
shades
of
gray
in
order
to
have
them
understand
what
color
experience
is
like
they
would
need
to
experience
it
themselves
”
he
says
“
physical
science
is
in
principle
incapable
of
telling
us
the
complete
story
”
of
the
various
alternatives
that
have
been
put
forward
he
says
that
“
panpsychism
is
our
best
bet
”
but
panpsychism
attracts
many
critics
as
well
some
point
out
that
it
doesn
t
explain
how
small
bits
of
consciousness
come
together
to
form
more
substantive
conscious
entities
detractors
say
that
this
puzzle
known
as
the
“
combination
problem
”
amounts
to
panpsychism
s
own
version
of
the
hard
problem
the
combination
problem
“
is
the
serious
challenge
for
the
panpsychist
position
”
goff
admits
“
and
it
s
where
most
of
our
energies
are
going
”
others
question
panpsychism
s
explanatory
power
in
his
2021
book
being
you
neuroscientist
anil
seth
wrote
that
the
main
problems
with
panpsychism
are
that
“
it
doesn
t
really
explain
anything
and
that
it
doesn
t
lead
to
testable
hypotheses
it
s
an
easy
getout
to
the
apparent
mystery
posed
by
the
hard
problem
”
while
most
of
those
invited
to
the
workshop
were
philosophers
there
were
also
talks
by
physicists
sean
carroll
and
lee
smolin
and
by
cognitive
psychologist
donald
hoffman
carroll
a
hardcore
physicalist
served
as
an
unofficial
leader
of
the
opposition
as
the
workshop
unfolded
he
occasionally
quipped
“
i
m
surrounded
by
panpsychists
”
during
a
wellattended
public
debate
between
goff
and
carroll
the
divergence
of
their
worldviews
quickly
became
apparent
goff
said
that
physicalism
has
led
“
precisely
nowhere
”
and
suggested
that
the
very
idea
of
trying
to
explain
consciousness
in
physical
terms
was
incoherent
carroll
argued
that
physicalism
is
actually
doing
quite
well
and
that
although
consciousness
is
one
of
many
phenomena
that
can
t
be
inferred
from
the
goingson
at
the
microscopic
level
it
is
nonetheless
a
real
emergent
feature
of
the
macroscopic
world
he
offered
the
physics
of
gases
as
a
parallel
example
at
the
micro
level
one
talks
of
atoms
molecules
and
forces
at
the
macro
level
one
speaks
of
pressure
volume
and
temperature
these
are
two
kinds
of
explanations
depending
on
the
“
level
”
being
studied
—
but
present
 
no
great
mystery
and
are
not
a
failure
on
the
part
of
physics
before
long
goff
and
carroll
were
deep
into
the
weeds
of
the
socalled
knowledge
argument
also
known
as
“
mary
in
the
black
and
white
room
”
as
well
as
the
“
zombie
”
argument
both
 
boil
down
to
the
same
key
question
is
there
something
about
consciousness
that
cannot
be
accounted
for
by
physical
facts
alone
much
of
the
rhetorical
pingpong
between
goff
and
carroll
amounted
to
goff
answering
yes
to
that
question
and
carroll
answering
no
another
objection
some
attendees
raised
is
that
panpsychism
doesn
t
address
what
philosophers
call
the
“
other
minds
”
problem
you
have
direct
access
to
your
own
mind
—
but
how
can
you
deduce
anything
at
all
about
another
person
s
mind
“
even
if
panpsychism
is
true
there
will
still
be
vast
amounts
of
things
—
namely
things
related
to
what
the
experiences
of
others
are
like
—
that
we
still
won
t
know
”
says
rebecca
chan
a
philosopher
at
san
josé
state
university
 
she
worries
that
invoking
an
underlying
layer
of
mindedness
is
a
bit
like
invoking
god
“
i
sometimes
wonder
if
the
panpsychist
position
is
similar
to
god
of
the
gaps
arguments
”
she
says
referring
to
the
notion
that
god
is
needed
to
fill
the
gaps
in
scientific
knowledge
other
ideas
were
batted
around
the
idea
of
cosmopsychism
was
floated
—
roughly
the
notion
that
the
universe
itself
is
conscious
and
paul
draper
a
philosopher
at
purdue
university
who
participated
via
zoom
talked
about
a
subtly
different
idea
known
as
“
psychological
ether
theory
”
—
essentially
that
brains
don
t
produce
consciousness
but
rather
make
use
of
consciousness
in
this
view
consciousness
was
already
there
before
brains
existed
like
an
allpervasive
ether
if
the
idea
is
correct
he
writes
“
then
in
all
likelihood
god
exists
”
hoffman
a
cognitive
scientist
at
the
university
of
california
irvine
who
also
addressed
the
workshop
via
zoom
advocates
rejecting
the
idea
of
spacetime
and
looking
for
something
deeper
he
cited
the
increasingly
popular
idea
in
physics
lately
that
space
and
time
may
not
be
fundamental
but
may
instead
be
emergent
phenomena
themselves
the
deeper
entity
related
to
consciousness
hoffman
suggests
may
consist
of
“
subjects
and
experiences
”
that
he
says
“
are
entities
beyond
spacetime
not
within
spacetime
”
he
developed
this
idea
in
a
2023
paper
entitled
“
fusions
of
consciousness
”
smolin
a
physicist
at
the
perimeter
institute
for
theoretical
physics
in
ontario
who
also
participated
via
zoom
has
similarly
been
working
on
theories
that
appear
to
offer
a
more
central
role
for
conscious
agents
in
a
2020
paper
he
suggested
that
the
universe
“
is
composed
of
a
set
of
partial
views
of
itself
”
and
that
“
conscious
perceptions
are
aspects
of
some
views
”
—
a
perspective
that
he
says
can
be
thought
of
as
“
a
restricted
form
of
panpsychism
”
carroll
speaking
after
the
session
that
included
both
hoffman
and
smolin
noted
that
his
own
views
diverged
from
those
of
the
speakers
within
the
first
couple
of
minutes
over
lunch
he
noted
that
attending
the
workshop
sometimes
felt
like
being
on
a
subreddit
for
fans
of
a
tv
show
that
you
re
just
not
into
he
admitted
that
endless
debates
over
the
nature
of
“
reality
”
sometimes
left
him
frustrated
“
people
ask
me
what
is
physical
reality
it
s
physical
reality
there
s
nothing
that
it
is
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
that
it
s
made
of
macaroni
or
something
”
even
carroll
however
admits
that
there
s
more
to
reality
than
meets
the
eye
he
s
a
strong
supporter
of
the
“
many
worlds
”
interpretation
of
quantum
mechanics
which
holds
that
our
universe
is
just
one
facet
of
a
vast
quantum
multiverse
if
all
of
this
sounds
like
it
couldn
t
possibly
have
any
practical
value
goff
raised
the
possibility
that
how
we
conceive
of
minds
can
have
ethical
implications
take
the
question
of
whether
fish
feel
pain
traditional
science
can
only
study
a
fish
s
outward
behavior
not
its
mental
state
to
goff
focusing
on
the
fish
s
behavior
is
not
only
wrongheaded
but
“
horrific
”
because
it
leaves
out
what
s
actually
most
important
—
what
the
fish
actually
feels
“
we
re
going
to
stop
asking
if
fish
are
conscious
and
just
look
at
their
behavior
who
gives
a
shit
about
the
behavior
i
want
to
know
if
it
has
an
inner
life
that
s
all
that
matters
”
for
physicalists
such
as
carroll
however
feelings
and
behavior
are
intimately
linked
—
which
means
we
can
avoid
causing
an
animal
to
suffer
by
not
putting
it
in
a
situation
where
it
appears
to
be
suffering
based
on
its
behavior
“
if
there
were
no
connection
between
them
behavior
and
feelings
we
would
indeed
be
in
trouble
”
says
carroll
“
but
that
s
not
our
world
”
seth
the
neuroscientist
was
not
at
the
workshop
—
but
i
asked
him
where
he
stands
in
the
debate
over
physicalism
and
its
various
alternatives
physicalism
he
says
still
offers
more
“
empirical
grip
”
than
its
competitors
—
and
he
laments
what
he
sees
as
excessive
handwringing
over
its
alleged
failures
including
the
supposed
hardness
of
the
hard
problem
“
critiquing
physicalism
on
the
basis
that
it
has
failed
is
willful
mischaracterization
”
he
says
“
it
s
doing
just
fine
as
progress
in
consciousness
science
readily
attests
”
in
a
recently
published
article
in
the
journal
of
consciousness
studies
seth
adds
“
asserting
that
consciousness
is
fundamental
and
ubiquitous
does
nothing
to
shed
light
on
the
way
an
experience
of
blueness
is
the
way
it
is
and
not
some
other
way
nor
does
it
explain
anything
about
the
possible
functions
of
consciousness
nor
why
consciousness
is
lost
in
states
such
as
dreamless
sleep
general
anaesthesia
and
coma
”
even
those
who
lean
toward
panpsychism
sometimes
seem
hesitant
to
dive
into
the
deep
end
as
garcia
put
it
in
spite
of
the
allure
of
a
universe
imbued
with
consciousness
“
i
would
love
to
be
talked
out
of
it

the
universal
mind
or
universal
consciousness
is
a
metaphysical
concept
suggesting
an
underlying
essence
of
all
beings
and
becoming
in
the
universe
it
includes
the
being
and
becoming
that
occurred
in
the
universe
prior
to
the
emergence
of
the
concept
of
mind
a
term
that
more
appropriately
refers
to
the
organic
human
aspect
of
universal
consciousness
it
addresses
inorganic
being
and
becoming
and
the
interactions
that
occur
in
that
process
without
specific
reference
to
the
physical
and
chemical
laws
that
try
to
describe
those
interactions
those
interactions
have
occurred
do
occur
and
continue
to
occur
universal
consciousness
is
the
source
that
underlies
those
interactions
and
the
awareness
and
knowledge
they
imply
introduction
edit
the
concept
of
the
universal
mind
was
presented
by
anaxagoras
a
presocratic
philosopher
who
arrived
in
athens
some
time
after
480
bc
he
taught
that
the
growth
of
living
things
depends
on
the
power
of
mind
within
the
organisms
that
enables
them
to
extract
nourishment
from
surrounding
substances
for
this
concept
of
mind
anaxagoras
was
commended
by
aristotle
both
plato
and
aristotle
however
objected
that
his
notion
of
mind
did
not
include
a
view
that
mind
acts
ethically
i
e
acts
for
the
“
best
interests
”
of
the
universe
the
most
original
aspect
of
anaxagoras
s
system
was
his
doctrine
of
nous
mind
or
reason
a
different
greek
word
gnósi
knowledge
better
reflects
what
is
observed
in
the
wider
world
of
organic
and
inorganic
beings
than
just
the
human
world
chu
ch
an
says
“
the
universal
mind
therefore
is
something
to
which
nothing
can
be
attributed
being
absolute
goes
beyond
attributes
if
for
example
it
were
to
be
described
as
infinite
that
would
exclude
from
it
whatever
is
finite
but
the
whole
argument
of
the
book
is
that
the
universal
mind
is
the
only
reality
and
that
everything
we
apprehend
through
our
senses
is
nothing
else
but
this
mind
even
to
think
of
it
in
terms
of
existence
or
nonexistence
is
to
misapprehend
it
entirely
”
pp
8
–
9
the
term
surfaced
again
in
later
philosophy
as
in
the
writings
of
hegel
hegel
writes
¤
377
the
knowledge
of
mind
is
the
highest
and
hardest
just
because
it
is
the
most
concrete
of
sciences
the
significance
of
that
absolute
commandment
know
thyself
−
whether
we
look
at
it
in
itself
or
under
the
historical
circumstances
of
its
first
utterance
−
is
not
to
promote
mere
self
−
knowledge
in
respect
of
the
particular
capacities
character
propensities
and
foibles
of
the
single
self
the
knowledge
it
commands
means
that
of
man
s
genuine
reality
−
of
what
is
essentially
and
ultimately
true
and
real
−
of
mind
as
the
true
and
essential
being

1991
i
grew
up
in
a
devout
and
practicing
roman
catholic
family
with
purzel
a
fearless
and
highenergy
dachshund
he
as
with
all
the
other
much
larger
dogs
that
subsequently
accompanied
me
through
life
showed
plenty
of
affection
curiosity
playfulness
aggression
anger
shame
and
fear
yet
my
church
teaches
that
whereas
animals
as
god
s
creatures
ought
to
be
treated
well
they
do
not
possess
an
immortal
soul
only
humans
do
even
as
a
child
to
me
this
belief
felt
intuitively
wrong
these
gorgeous
creatures
had
feelings
just
like
i
did
why
deny
them
why
would
god
resurrect
people
but
not
dogs
this
core
christian
belief
in
human
exceptionalism
did
not
make
any
sense
to
me
whatever
consciousness
and
mind
are
and
no
matter
how
they
relate
to
the
brain
and
the
rest
of
the
body
i
felt
that
the
same
principle
must
hold
for
people
and
dogs
and
by
extension
for
other
animals
as
well
it
was
only
later
at
university
that
i
became
acquainted
with
buddhism
and
its
emphasis
on
the
universal
nature
of
mind
indeed
when
i
spent
a
week
with
his
holiness
the
dalai
lama
earlier
in
2013
see

2013
i
noted
how
often
he
talked
about
the
need
to
reduce
the
suffering
of
“
all
living
beings
”
and
not
just
“
all
people
”
my
readings
in
philosophy
brought
me
to
panpsychism
the
view
that
mind
psyche
is
found
everywhere
pan
panpsychism
is
one
of
the
oldest
of
all
philosophical
doctrines
extant
and
was
put
forth
by
the
ancient
greeks
in
particular
thales
of
miletus
and
plato
philosopher
baruch
spinoza
and
mathematician
and
universal
genius
gottfried
wilhelm
leibniz
who
laid
down
the
intellectual
foundations
for
the
age
of
enlightenment
argued
for
panpsychism
as
did
philosopher
arthur
schopenhauer
father
of
american
psychology
william
james
and
jesuit
paleontologist
teilhard
de
chardin
it
declined
in
popularity
with
the
rise
of
positivism
in
the
20th
century
on
supporting
science
journalism

today
as
a
natural
scientist
i
find
a
version
of
panpsychism
modified
for
the
21st
century
to
be
the
single
most
elegant
and
parsimonious
explanation
for
the
universe
i
find
myself
in
there
are
three
broad
reasons
why
panpsychism
is
appealing
to
the
modern
mind
we
are
all
nature
s
children
the
past
two
centuries
of
scientific
progress
have
made
it
difficult
to
sustain
a
belief
in
human
exceptionalism
consider
my
bernese
mountain
dog
ruby
when
she
yelps
whines
gnaws
at
her
paw
limps
and
then
comes
to
me
seeking
aid
i
infer
that
she
is
in
pain
because
under
similar
conditions
i
behave
in
similar
ways
sans
gnawing
physiological
measures
of
pain
confirm
this
inference
—
injured
dogs
just
like
people
experience
an
elevated
heart
rate
and
blood
pressure
and
release
stress
hormones
into
their
bloodstream
i
m
not
saying
that
a
dog
s
pain
is
exactly
like
human
pain
but
dogs
—
as
well
as
other
animals
—
not
only
react
to
noxious
stimuli
but
also
consciously
experience
pain
all
species
—
bees
octopuses
ravens
crows
magpies
parrots
tuna
mice
whales
dogs
cats
and
monkeys
—
are
capable
of
sophisticated
learned
nonstereotyped
behaviors
that
would
be
associated
with
consciousness
if
a
human
were
to
carry
out
such
actions
precursors
of
behaviors
thought
to
be
unique
to
people
are
found
in
many
species
for
instance
bees
are
capable
of
recognizing
specific
faces
from
photographs
can
communicate
the
location
and
quality
of
food
sources
to
their
sisters
via
the
waggle
dance
and
can
navigate
complex
mazes
with
the
help
of
cues
they
store
in
shortterm
memory
for
instance
“
after
arriving
at
a
fork
take
the
exit
marked
by
the
color
at
the
entrance
”
bees
can
fly
several
kilometers
and
return
to
their
hive
a
remarkable
navigational
performance
and
a
scent
blown
into
the
hive
can
trigger
a
return
to
the
site
where
the
bees
previously
encountered
this
odor
this
type
of
associative
memory
was
famously
described
by
marcel
proust
in
à
la
recherche
du
temps
perdu
other
animals
can
recognize
themselves
know
when
their
conspecifics
observe
them
and
can
lie
and
cheat
some
people
point
to
language
and
the
associated
benefits
as
being
the
unique
defining
feature
of
consciousness
conveniently
this
viewpoint
rules
out
all
but
one
species
homo
sapiens
which
has
an
ineradicable
desire
to
come
out
on
top
as
having
sentience
yet
there
is
little
reason
to
deny
consciousness

animals

of

the
last
book

his

out

“

”
studying
their

for
several
decades
—
darwin
was
after
all
a
naturalist
with
uncanny
powers
of
observation
—
he
concluded
that
there
was
no
absolute
threshold
between
lower
and
higher
animals
including
humans
that
assigned
higher
mental
powers
to
one
but
not
to
the
other
the
nervous
systems
of
all
these
creatures
are
highly
complex
their
constitutive
proteins
genes
synapses
cells
and
neuronal
circuits
are
as
sophisticated
variegated
and
specialized
as
anything
seen
in
the
human
brain
it
is
difficult
to
find
anything
exceptional
about
the
human
brain
even
its
size
is
not
so
special
because
elephants
dolphins
and
whales
have
bigger
brains
only
an
expert
neuroanatomist
armed
with
a
microscope
can
tell
a
grainsize
piece
of
cortex
of
a
mouse
from
that
of
a
monkey
or
a
human
biologists
emphasize
this
structural
and
behavioral
continuity
by
distinguishing
between
nonhuman
and
human
animals
we
are
all
nature
s
children
given
the
lack
of
a
clear
and
compelling
rubicon
separating
simple
from
complex
animals
and
simple
from
complex
behaviors
the
belief
that
only
humans
are
capable
of
experiencing
anything
consciously
seems
preposterous
a
much
more
reasonable
assumption
is
that
until
proved
otherwise
many
if
not
all
multicellular
organisms
experience
pain
and
pleasure
and
can
see
and
hear
the
sights
and
sounds
of
life
for
brains
that
are
smaller
and
less
complex
the
creatures
conscious
experience
is
very
likely
to
be
less
nuanced
less
differentiated
and
more
elemental
even
a
worm
has
perhaps
the
vaguest
sense
of
being
alive
of
course
each
species
has
its
own
unique
sensorium
matched
to
its
ecological
niche
not
every
creature
has
ears
to
hear
and
eyes
to
see
yet
all
are
capable
of
having
at
least
some
subjective
feelings
the
austere
appeal
of
panpsychism
taken
literally
panpsychism
is
the
belief
that
everything
is
“
enminded
”
all
of
it
whether
it
is
a
brain
a
tree
a
rock
or
an
electron
everything
that
is
physical
also
possesses
an
interior
mental
aspect
one
is
objective
—
accessible
to
everybody
—
and
the
other
phenomenal
—
accessible
only
to
the
subject
that
is
the
sense
of
the
quotation
by
britishborn
buddhist
scholar
alan
watts
with
which
i
began
this
essay
i
will
defend
a
narrowed
more
nuanced
view
namely
that
any
complex
system
as
defined
below
has
the
basic
attributes
of
mind
and
has
a
minimal
amount
of
consciousness
in
the
sense
that
it
feels
like
something
to
be
that
system
if
the
system
falls
apart
consciousness
ceases
to
be
it
doesn
t
feel
like
anything
to
be
a
broken
system
and
the
more
complex
the
system
the
larger
the
repertoire
of
conscious
states
it
can
experience
my
subjective
experience
and
yours
too
presumably
the
cartesian
“
i
think
therefore
i
am
”
is
an
undeniable
certainty
one
strong
enough
to
hold
the
weight
of
philosophy
but
from
whence
does
this
experience
come
materialists
invoke
something
they
call
emergentism
to
explain
how
consciousness
can
be
absent
in
simple
nervous
systems
and
emerge
as
their
complexity
increases
consider
the
wetness
of
water
its
ability
to
maintain
contact
with
surfaces
it
is
a
consequence
of
intermolecular
interactions
notably
hydrogen
bonding
among
nearby
water
molecules
one
or
two
molecules
of
h
₂
o
are
not
wet
but
put
gazillions
together
at
the
right
temperature
and
pressure
and
wetness
emerges
or
see
how
the
laws
of
heredity
emerge
from
the
molecular
properties
of
dna
rna
and
proteins
by
the
same
process
mind
is
supposed
to
arise
out
of
sufficiently
complex
brains
yet
the
mental
is
too
radically
different
for
it
to
arise
gradually
from
the
physical
this
emergence
of
subjective
feelings
from
physical
stuff
appears
inconceivable
and
is
at
odds
with
a
basic
precept
of
physical
thinking
the
urconservation
law
—
ex
nihilo
nihil
fit
so
if
there
is
nothing
there
in
the
first
place
adding
a
little
bit
more
won
t
make
something
if
a
small
brain
won
t
be
able
to
feel
pain
why
should
a
large
brain
be
able
to
feel
the
godawfulness
of
a
throbbing
toothache
why
should
adding
some
neurons
give
rise
to
this
ineffable
feeling
the
phenomenal
hails
from
a
kingdom
other
than
the
physical
and
is
subject
to
different
laws
i
see
no
way
for
the
divide
between
unconscious
and
conscious
states
to
be
bridged
by
bigger
brains
or
more
complex
neurons
a
more
principled
solution
is
to
assume
that
consciousness
is
a
basic
feature
of
certain
types
of
socalled
complex
systems
defined
in
some
universal
mathematical
manner
and
that
complex
systems
have
sensation
whereas
simple
systems
have
none
this
reasoning
is
analogous
to
the
arguments
made
by
savants
studying
electrical
charge
in
the
18th
century
charge
is
not
an
emergent
property
of
living
things
as
originally
thought
when
electricity
was
discovered
in
the
twitching
muscles
of
frogs
there
are
no
uncharged
particles
that
in
the
aggregate
produce
an
electrical
charge
elementary
particles
either
have
some
charge
or
they
have
none
thus
an
electron
has
one
negative
charge
a
proton
has
one
positive
charge
and
a
photon
the
carrier
of
light
has
zero
charge
as
far
as
chemistry
and
biology
are
concerned
charge
is
an
intrinsic
property
of
these
particles
electrical
charge
does
not
emerge
from
noncharged
matter
it
is
the
same
goes
the
logic
with
consciousness
consciousness
comes
with
organized
chunks
of
matter
it
is
immanent
in
the
organization
of
the
system
it
is
a
property
of
complex
entities
and
cannot
be
further
reduced
to
the
action
of
more
elementary
properties
we
have
reached
the
ground
floor
of
reductionism
yet
as
traditionally
conceived
panpsychism
suffers
from
two
major
flaws
one
is
known
as
the
problem
of
aggregates
philosopher
john
searle
of
the
university
of
california
berkeley
expressed
it
recently
“
consciousness
cannot
spread
over
the
universe
like
a
thin
veneer
of
jam
there
has
to
be
a
point
where
my
consciousness
ends
and
yours
begins
”
indeed
if
consciousness
is
everywhere
why
should
it
not
animate
the
iphone
the
internet
or
the
united
states
of
america
furthermore
panpsychism
does
not
explain
why
a
healthy
brain
is
conscious
whereas
the
same
brain
placed
inside
a
blender
and
reduced
to
goo
would
not
be
that
is
it
does
not
explain
how
aggregates
combine
to
produce
specific
conscious
experience
integrated
panpsychism
these
centuryold
arguments
bring
me
to
the
conceptual
framework
of
the
integrated
information
theory
iit
of
psychiatrist
and
neuroscientist
giulio
tononi
of
the
university
of
wisconsin
–
madison
it
postulates
that
conscious
experience
is
a
fundamental
aspect
of
reality
and
is
identical
to
a
particular
type
of
information
—
integrated
information
consciousness
depends
on
a
physical
substrate
but
is
not
reducible
to
it
that
is
my
experience
of
seeing
an
aquamarine
blue
is
inexorably
linked
to
my
brain
but
is
different
from
my
brain
any
system
that
possesses
some
nonzero
amount
of
integrated
information
experiences
something
let
me
repeat
any
system
that
has
even
one
bit
of
integrated
information
has
a
very
minute
conscious
experience
iit
makes
two
principled
assumptions
first
conscious
states
are
highly
differentiated
they
are
informationally
very
rich
you
can
be
conscious
of
an
uncountable
number
of
things
think
of
all
the
frames
from
all
the
movies
that
you
have
ever
seen
or
that
have
ever
been
filmed
or
that
will
be
filmed
each
frame
each
view
is
a
specific
conscious
percept
second
each
such
experience
is
highly
integrated
you
cannot
force
yourself
to
see
the
world
in
black
and
white
its
color
is
an
integrated
part
of
your
view
whatever
information
you
are
conscious
of
is
wholly
and
completely
presented
to
your
mind
it
cannot
be
subdivided
underlying
this
unity
of
consciousness
is
a
multitude
of
causal
interactions
among
the
relevant
parts
of
your
brain
if
parts
of
the
brain
become
fragmented
and
balkanized
as
occurs
in
deep
sleep
or
in
anesthesia
consciousness
fades
to
be
conscious
then
you
need
to
be
a
single
integrated
entity
with
a
large
repertoire
of
highly
differentiated
states
even
if
the
hard
disk
on
my
laptop
exceeds
in
capacity
my
lifetime
memories
none
of
its
information
is
integrated
the
family
photos
on
my
mac
are
not
linked
to
one
another
the
computer
does
not
know
that
the
boy
in
those
pictures
is
my
son
as
he
matures
from
a
toddler
to
an
awkward
teenager
and
then
a
graceful
adult
to
my
computer
all
information
is
equally
meaningless
just
a
vast
random
tapestry
of
0s
and
1s
yet
i
derive
meaning
from
these
images
because
my
memories
are
heavily
crosslinked
and
the
more
interconnected
the
more
meaningful
they
become
these
ideas
can
be
precisely
expressed
in
the
language
of
mathematics
using
notions
from
information
theory
such
as
entropy
given
a
particular
brain
with
its
neurons
in
a
particular
state
—
these
neurons
are
firing
while
those
ones
are
quiet
—
one
can
precisely
compute
the
extent
to
which
this
network
is
integrated
from
this
calculation

complex
artifact
the

it

of
billions
of

linked

its

that
of
any

whether
or
not
the

today
feels
like
something
to
itself
is
completely
speculative
still
it
is
certainly
conceivable
when
i
talk
and
write
about

i
often
encounter
blank
stares
of
incomprehension
such
a
belief
violates
people
s
strongly
held
intuition
that
sentience
is
something
only
humans
and
a

species
possess

our
intuition
also
fails
when
we
are

that

collective
consciousness
collective
conscience
or
collective
conscious
french
conscience
collective
is
the
set
of
shared
beliefs
ideas
and
moral
attitudes
which
operate
as
a
unifying
force
within
society
1
in
general
it
does
not
refer
to
the
specifically
moral
conscience
but
to
a
shared
understanding
of
social
norms
2
the
modern
concept
of
what
can
be
considered
collective
consciousness
includes
solidarity
attitudes
memes
extreme
behaviors
like
groupthink
and
herd
behavior
and
collectively
shared
experiences
during
collective
rituals
dance
parties3
and
the
discarnate
entities
which
can
be
experienced
from
psychedelic
use

rather
than
existing
as
separate
individuals
people
come
together
as
dynamic
groups
to
share
resources
and
knowledge
it
has
also
developed
as
a
way
of
describing
how
an
entire
community
comes
together
to
share
similar
values
this
has
also
been
termed
hive

group

mass
mind
and
social
mind

historical
use
of
collective
consciousness
edit
the
term
was
introduced
by
the
french
sociologist
émile
durkheim
in
his
the
division
of
labour
in
society
in
1893
the
french
word
conscience
generally
means
conscience
consciousness
awareness6
or
perception
7
given
the
multiplicity
of
definitions
translators
of
durkheim
disagree
on
which
is
most
appropriate
or
whether
the
translation
should
depend
on
the
context
some
prefer
to
treat
the
word
conscience
as
an
untranslatable
foreign
word
or
technical
term
without
its
normal
english
meaning
8
as
for
collective
durkheim
makes
clear
that
he
is
not
reifying
or
hypostasizing
this
concept
for
him
it
is
collective
simply
in
the
sense
that
it
is
common
to
many
individuals9
cf
social
fact
scipio
sighele
published
la
foule
criminele
one
year
before
durkheim
in
which
he
describes
emergent
characteristics
of
crowds
that
don
t
appear
in
the
individuals
that
form
the
crowd
he
doesn
t
call
this
collective
consciousness
but
âme
de
la
foule
soul
of
the
crowd
10
this
term
returns
in
sigmund
freud
s
book
about
mass
psychology
and
essentially
overlaps
with
durkheims
concept
of
collective
consciousness
theories
of
collective
consciousness
edit
durkheim
edit
durkheim
used
the
term
in
his
books
the
division
of
labour
in
society
1893
the
rules
of
the
sociological
method
1895
suicide
1897
and
the
elementary
forms
of
religious
life
1912
in
the
division
of
labour
durkheim
argued
that
in
traditionalprimitive
societies
those
based
around
clan
family
or
tribal
relationships
totemic
religion
played
an
important
role
in
uniting
members
through
the
creation
of
a
common
consciousness
in
societies
of
this
type
the
contents
of
an
individual
s
consciousness
are
largely
shared
in
common
with
all
other
members
of
their
society
creating
a
mechanical
solidarity
through
mutual
likeness
the
totality
of
beliefs
and
sentiments
common
to
the
average
members
of
a
society
forms
a
determinate
system
with
a
life
of
its
own
it
can
be
termed
the
collective
or
common
consciousness
—
émile
durkheim11
in
suicide
durkheim
developed
the
concept
of
anomie
to
refer
to
the
social
rather
than
individual
causes
of
suicide
this
relates
to
the
concept
of
collective
consciousness
as
if
there
is
a
lack
of
integration
or
solidarity
in
society
then
suicide
rates
will
be
higher
12
gramsci
edit
antonio
gramsci
states
“
a
collective
consciousness
which
is
to
say
a
living
organism
is
formed
only
after
the
unification
of
the
multiplicity
through
friction
on
the
part
of
the
individuals
nor
can
one
say
that
silence
is
not
a
multiplicity
”
13
a
form
of
collective
consciousness
can
be
formed
from
gramsci
s
conception
that
the
presence
of
a
hegemony
can
mobilize
the
collective
consciousness
of
those
oppressed
by
the
ruling
ideas
of
society
or
the
ruling
hegemony
collective
consciousness
can
refer
to
a
multitude
of
different
individual
forms
of
consciousness
coalescing
into
a
greater
whole
in
gramsci
s
view
a
unified
whole
is
composed
of
solidarity
among
its
different
constituent
parts
and
therefore
this
whole
cannot
be
uniformly
the
same
the
unified
whole
can
embrace
different
forms
of
consciousness
or
individual
experiences
of
social
reality
which
coexist
to
reflect
the
different
experiences
of
the
marginalized
peoples
in
a
given
society
this
agrees
with
gramsci
s
theory
of
marxism
and
class
struggle
applied
to
cultural
contexts
cultural
marxism
as
distinguished
from
the
rightwing
use
of
the
term
embodies
the
concept
of
collective
consciousness
it
incorporates
social
movements
that
are
based
on
some
sort
of
collective
identity
these
identities
can
include
for
instance
gender
sexual
orientation
race
and
ability
and
can
be
incorporated
by
collectivebased
movements
into
a
broader
historical
material
analysis
of
class
struggle
according
to
michelle
filippini
“
the
nature
and
workings
of
collective
organisms
–
not
only
parties
but
also
trade
unions
associations
and
intermediate
bodies
in
general
–
represent
a
specific
sphere
of
reflection
in
the
prison
notebooks
particularly
in
regard
to
the
new
relationship
between
state
and
society
that
in
gramsci
s
view
emerged
during
the
age
of
mass
politics
”
14
collective
organisms
can
express
collective
consciousness
whether
this
form
of
expression
finds
itself
in
the
realm
of
the
state
or
the
realm
of
society
is
up
to
the
direction
that
the
subjects
take
in
expressing
their
collective
consciousness
in
gramsci
s
prison
notebooks
the
ongoing
conflict
between
civil
society
the
bureaucracy
and
the
state
necessitates
the
emergence
of
a
collective
consciousness
that
can
often
act
as
an
intermediary
between
these
different
realms
the
public
organizations
of
protest
such
as
labor
unions
and
antiwar
organizations
are
vehicles
that
can
unite
multiple
types
of
collective
consciousness
although
identitybased
movements
are
necessary
for
the
progress
of
democracy
and
can
generate
collective
consciousness
they
cannot
completely
do
so
without
a
unifying
framework
this
is
why
antiwar
and
labor
movements
provide
an
avenue
that
has
united
various
social
movements
under
the
banner
of
a
multiple
collective
consciousness
this
is
also
why
future
social
movements
need
to
have
an
ethos
of
collective
consciousness
if
they
are
to
succeed
in
the
longterm
zukerfield
edit
zukerfield
states
that
“
the
different
disciplines
that
have
studied
knowledge
share
an
understanding
of
it
as
a
product
of
human
subjects
–
individual
collective
etc
”
15
knowledge
in
a
sociological
sense
is
derived
from
social
conditions
and
social
realities
collective
consciousness
also
reflects
social
realities
and
sociological
knowledge
can
be
gained
through
the
adoption
of
a
collective
consciousness
many
different
disciplines
such
as
philosophy
and
literature
examine
collective
consciousness
from
different
lenses
these
different
disciplines
reach
a
similar
understanding
of
a
collective
consciousness
despite
their
different
approaches
to
the
subject
the
inherent
humanness
in
the
idea
of
collective
consciousness
refers
to
a
shared
way
of
thinking
among
human
beings
in
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
collective
consciousness
can
provide
an
understanding
of
the
relationship
between
self
and
society
as
zukerfeld
states
“
even
though
it
impels
us
as
a
first
customary
gesture
to
analyse
the
subjective
such
as
individual
consciousness
or
intersubjective
bearers
such
as
the
values
of
a
given
society
in
other
words
those
which
marxism
and
sociology
examine
now
we
can
approach
them
in
an
entirely
different
light
”
16
“
cognitive
materialism
”
15
is
presented
in
the
work
by
zukerfeld
as
a
sort
of
third
way
between
sociological
knowledge
and
marxism
cognitive
materialism
is
based
on
a
kind
of
collective
consciousness
of
the
mind
this
consciousness
can
be
used
with
cognitive
materialism
as
a
guiding
force
by
human
beings
in
order
to
critically
analyze
society
and
social
conditions
collective
consciousness
in
society
edit
society
is
made
up
of
various
collective
groups
such
as
the
family
community
organizations
regions
nations
which
as
burns
and
egdahl
state
can
be
considered
to
possess
agential
capabilities
to
think
judge
decide
act
reform
to
conceptualize
self
and
others
as
well
as
self
s
actions
and
interactions
and
to
reflect
17
it
is
suggested
that
these
different
national
behaviors
vary
according
to
the
different
collective
consciousness
between
nations
this
illustrates
that
differences
in
collective
consciousness
can
have
practical
significance
according
to
a
theory
the
character
of
collective
consciousness
depends
on
the
type
of
mnemonic
encoding
used
within
a
group
tsoukalas
2007
the
specific
type
of
encoding
used
has
a
predictable
influence
on
the
group
s
behavior
and
collective
ideology
informal
groups
that
meet
infrequently
and
spontaneously
have
a
tendency
to
represent
significant
aspects
of
their
community
as
episodic
memories
this
usually
leads
to
strong
social
cohesion
and
solidarity
an
indulgent
atmosphere
an
exclusive
ethos
and
a
restriction
of
social
networks
formal
groups
that
have
scheduled
and
anonymous
meetings
tend
to
represent
significant
aspects
of
their
community
as
semantic
memories
which
usually
leads
to
weak
social
cohesion
and
solidarity
a
more
moderate
atmosphere
an
inclusive
ethos
and
an
expansion
of
social
networks

as

there
is
still
a

present
in

understanding
the
mystery
of
collective
consciousness
meridian
team
the
intricate
labyrinth
that
is
the
human
psyche
has
been
a
topic
of
fascination
for
many
great
thinkers
drawing
the
attention
of
figures
such
as
sigmund
freud
and
carl
jung
both
sought
to
map
out
the
territories
of
the
mind
but
it
was
carl
jung
who
delved
into
a
realm
that
transcends
personal
experience
at
the
crossroads
between
individuality
and
universality
the
collective
unconscious
emerges
embark
with
us
as
we
navigate
the
profound
waters
of
the
collective
unconscious
unveiling
its
scientific
support
and
its
profound
resonance
with
many
people
the
image
of
a
woman
gazing
into
the
distance
is
overlapped
with
an
image
of
the
cosmos
in
the
tapestry
of
collective
consciousness
we
weave
our
individual
stories
into
a
greater
narrative
of
unity
what
is
the
collective
consciousness
theory
what
is
durkheim
s
theory
of
collective
consciousness
émile
durkheim
a
pioneering
figure
in
sociology
coined
the
french
term
conscience
collective
his
idea
of
collective
consciousness
refers
to
beliefs
and
sentiments
common
to
average
members
of
society
forming
a
determinate
system
that
has
its
own
life
according
to
durkheim
this
system
could
be
investigated
using
the
sociological
method
and
it
sheds
light
on
how
societies
maintain
cohesion
and
solidarity
what
did
carl
jung
mean
by
collective
consciousness
carl
jung
the
pioneering
swiss
psychiatrist
and
psychoanalyst
expanded
upon
prevailing
notions
of
shared
human
experience
while
earlier
thinkers
like
durkheim
had
raised
the
subject
of
this
collective
consciousness
—
a
shared
set
of
beliefs
values
and
societal
norms
that
bind
communities
together
jung
ventured
deeper
he
introduced
a
distinction
between
the
personal
unconscious
 
a
reservoir
of
each
individual
s
memories
and
experiences
and
the
collective
unconscious
a
more
profound
layer
teeming
with
archetypes
these
archetypes
such
as
the
hero
the
mother
or
the
shadow
are
universal
symbols
and
patterns
that
resonate
across
cultures
and
eras
deeply
embedded
in
our
shared
human
experience
they
surface
in
dreams
myths
and
artistic
expressions
revealing
shared
psychic
structures
that
shape
the
perceptions
of
all
humans
this
is
where
the
distinction
and
interplay
between
collective
consciousness
and
collective
unconscious
become
crucial
durkheim
s
collective
consciousness
captures
the
conscious
agreements
that
make
societal
cohesion
possible
—
the
realm
of
shared
traditions
laws
and
cultural
norms
building
upon
this
understanding
jung
proposed
that
the
collective
unconscious
lies
beneath
this
layer
of
shared
consciousness
 
this
realm
is
not
about
societal
agreements
but
taps
into
innate
universal
symbols
and
themes
that
inform
societal
structures
and
animate
our
dreams
stories
and
behaviors
 
in
this
context
the
collective
unconscious
is
a
bedrock
of
the
human
psyche
highlighting
a
universality
that
surpasses
temporal
cultural
and
individual
boundaries
is
the
collective
unconscious
real
the
empirical
path
to
proving
jung
s
collective
unconscious
is
a
complex
journey
threading
its
way
through
diverse
fields
of
study
jung
s
exploration
into
the
collective
unconscious
pointed
towards
shared
archetypal
symbols
inherent
within
the
human
psyche
this
notion
is
supported
by
various
spiritual
traditions
from
the
hindu
kecak
chanters
of
indonesia
to
the
gathered
meetings
of
american
quakers
similarly
studies
have
highlighted
instances
of
collective
consciousness
during
advanced
states
of
group
meditation
and
within
oral
cultures
such
as
the
australian
aborigines
and
the
san
people
of
africa
from
the
perspective
of
natural
sciences
our
current
understanding
seems
to
fall
short
in
explaining
these
phenomena
but
there
is
no
shortage
of
theories
insights
into
the
evolution
of
human
communication
reveal
fascinating
discoveries
such
as
mirror
neurons
which
respond
to
intentions
and
emotions
there
is
speculation
that
these
neurons
could
be
central
in
fostering
collective
experiences
playing
a
significant
role
in
the
emergence
of
language
and
reflective
selfconsciousness
what
are
examples
of
the
collective
consciousness
archetypes
archetypes
like
“
the
mother
”
“
the
hero
”
or
“
the
shadow
”
are
present
across
cultures
and
eras
these
serve
as
windows
into
our
shared
psychic
space
dreams
common
dream
themes
from
flights
to
pursuits
can
be
perceived
as
ripples
from
our
collective
unconscious
transcending
personal
experience
myths
and
legends
ageold
tales
whether
of
heroes
or
mystical
creatures
have
sprung
up
with
similar
themes
across
many
cultures
speaking
to
a
shared
human
narrative
symbols
and
motifs
consider
the
mandala
–
a
geometric
configuration
of
symbols
–
that
appears
in
spiritual
practices
from
tibetan
buddhism
and
in
native
american
traditions
or
the
ubiquitous
symbol
of
the
serpent
which
has
been
interpreted
as
everything
from
a
harbinger
of
danger
to
a
symbol
of
knowledge
and
rebirth
these
recurring
symbols
though
expressed
differently
imply
a
shared
pool
of
thought
rites
and
rituals
the
practices
surrounding
life
and
death
marriage
and
passage
into
adulthood
are
remarkably
similar
across
distant
cultures
while
the
specifics
vary
–
a
bar
mitzvah
a
quinceañera
or
a
tribal
initiation
rite
–
the
essence
remains
intact
this
is
a
universal
nod
to
the
significant
phases
in
human
life
art
and
expression
cave
paintings
from
the
renowned
lascaux
in
france
to
the
bhimbetka
shelters
in
india
showcase
an
uncanny
similarity
whether
portraying
the
hunt
dance
or
mere
existence
these
prehistoric
remnants
bear
testimony
to
a
shared
aesthetic
instinct
and
an
innate
urge
to
document
our
experiences
moral
codes
and
ethics
while
laws
and
guidelines
vary
from
culture
to
culture
fundamental
principles
such
as
those
surrounding
murder
theft
and
honesty
remain
strikingly
consistent
these
shared
ethical
compasses
suggest
a
deeply
embedded
collective
understanding
of
right
and
wrong
the
dance
of
nature
from
the
ancient
celts
celebrating
the
solstice
to
native
american
rain
dances
the
collective
unconscious
reveals
itself
in
humanity
s
shared
reverence
of
nature
these
practices
imply
that
as
a
species
we
are
intrinsically
connected
to
the
world
around
us
celebrating
its
beauty
power
and
mystery
the
takeaway
a
group
of
people
spanning
multiple
ethnicities
and
identities
stand
in
a
semicircle
and
join
their
hands
together
at
the
center
the
realm
of
collective
consciousness
draws
attention
to
the
intricate
psychological
webs
that
unify
us
even
when
faced
with
our
distinct
differences
in
the
grand
tapestry
of
humanity
the
concept
of
collective
consciousness
serves
as
a
gentle
reminder
that
beyond
our
cultural
and
experiential
divides
we
are
united
by
an
undercurrent
of
shared
beliefs
sentiments
and
archetypes
in
all
chaos
there
is
a
cosmos
in
all
disorder
a
secret
order
carl
jung
here
at
meridian
university

psyche

collective
consciousness

in
learning
about
the
symbols
psychological
structures
and
archetypes

to
the
human

collective
consciousness
sometimes
collective
conscience
or
conscious
is
a
fundamental
sociological
concept
that
refers
to
the
set
of
shared
beliefs
ideas
attitudes
and
knowledge
that
are
common
to
a
social
group
or
society
the
collective
consciousness
informs
our
sense
of
belonging
and
identity
and
our
behavior
founding
sociologist
émile
durkheim
developed
this
concept
to
explain
how
unique
individuals
are
bound
together
into
collective
units
like
social
groups
and
societies
how
collective
consciousness
holds
society
together
what
is
it
that
holds
society
together
this
was
the
central
question
that
preoccupied
durkheim
as
he
wrote
about
the
new
industrial
societies
of
the
19th
century
by
considering
the
documented
habits
customs
and
beliefs
of
traditional
and
primitive
societies
and
comparing
those
to
what
he
saw
around
him
in
his
own
life
durkheim
crafted
some
of
the
most
important
theories
in
sociology
he
concluded
that
society
exists
because
unique
individuals
feel
a
sense
of
solidarity
with
each
other
this
is
why
we
can
form
collectives
and
work
together
to
achieve
community
and
functional
societies
the
collective
consciousness
or
 
conscience
collective
 
as
he
wrote
it
in
french
is
the
source
of
this
solidarity
durkheim
first
introduced
his
theory
of
the
collective
consciousness
in
his
1893
book
the
division
of
labor
in
society
later
he
would
also
rely
on
the
concept
in
other
books
including
rules
of
the
sociological
method
suicide
and
the
elementary
forms
of
religious
life
 
in
this
text
he
explains
that
the
phenomenon
is
the
totality
of
beliefs
and
sentiments
common
to
the
average
members
of
a
society
durkheim
observed
that
in
traditional
or
primitive
societies
 
religious
symbols
discourse
beliefs
and
rituals
fostered
the
collective
consciousness
in
such
cases
where
social
groups
were
quite
homogenous
not
distinct
by
race
or
class
for
example
the
collective
consciousness
resulted
in
what
durkheim
termed
a
mechanical
solidarity
—
in
effect
an
automatic
binding
together
of
people
into
a
collective
through
their
shared
values
beliefs
and
practices
durkheim
observed
that
in
the
modern
industrialized
societies
that
characterized
western
europe
and
the
young
united
states
when
he
wrote
which
functioned
via
a
division
of
labor
an
organic
solidarity
emerged
based
on
the
mutual
reliance
individuals
and
groups
had
on
others
in
order
to
allow
for
a
society
to
function
in
cases
such
as
these
religion
still
played
an
important
role
in
producing
collective
consciousness
among
groups
of
people
affiliated
with
various
religions
but
other
social
institutions
and
structures
would
also
work
to
produce
the
collective
consciousness
necessary
for
this
more
complex
form
of
solidarity
and
rituals
outside
of
religion
would
play
important
roles
in
reaffirming
it
social
institutions
produce
collective
consciousness
these
other
institutions
include
the
state
which
fosters
patriotism
and
nationalism
news
and
popular
media
which
spreads
all
kinds
of
ideas
and
practices
from
how
to
dress
to
who
to
vote
for
to
how
to
date
and
be
married
education
which
molds
us
into
compliant
citizens
and
workers
and
the
police
and
judiciary
which
shape
our
notions
of
right
and
wrong
and
direct
our
behavior
through
threat
of
or
actual
physical
force
among
others
rituals
that
serve
to
reaffirm
the
collective
conscious
range
from
parades
and
holiday
celebrations
to
sporting
events
weddings
grooming
ourselves
according
to
gender
norms
and
even
shopping
think
black
friday
in
either
case
—
primitive
or
modern
societies
—
collective
consciousness
is
something
common
to
the
whole
of
society
as
durkheim
put
it
it
is
not
an
individual
condition
or
phenomenon
but
a
social
one
as
a
social
phenomenon
it
is
diffused
across
society
as
a
whole
and
has
a
life
of
its
own
it
is
through
collective
consciousness
that
values
beliefs
and
traditions
can
be
passed
down
through
generations
though
individual
people
live
and
die
this
collection
of
intangible
things
including
the
social
norms
connected
to
them
are
cemented
in
our
social
institutions
and
thus
exist
independent
of
individual
people
most
important
to
understand
is
that
collective
consciousness
is
the
result
of
social
forces
that
are
external
to
the
individual
that
course
through
society
and
that
work
together
to
create
the
social
phenomenon
of
the
shared
set
of
beliefs
values
and
ideas
that
compose
it
we
as
individuals
internalize
these
and
 
make
the
collective
consciousness
a
reality
by
doing
so
and
we
reaffirm
and
reproduce
it
by
living
in
ways
that
reflect
it

consciousness
shared
by

within
a
society
social
consciousness
or
social
awareness
is
collective
consciousness
shared
by
individuals
within
a
society
1
social
consciousness
is
linked
to
the
collective
selfawareness
and
experience
of
collectively
shared
social
identity
2
from
this
viewpoint
social
consciousness
denotes
conscious
awareness
of
being
part
of
an
interrelated
community
of
others
the
“
we
feeling
”
or
the
“
sense
of
us
”
may
be
experienced
in
members
of
various
cultures
and
social
groups
by
the
experience
of
collectively
shared
social
identity
individuals
may
experience
social
unity
social
consciousness
may
also
stimulate
working
towards
a
common
goal
according
to
karl
marx
human
beings
enter
into
certain
productive
or
economic
relations
and
these
relations
lead
to
a
form
of
social
consciousness
1
marx
said
in
the
social
production
of
their
life
men
enter
into
definite
relations
that
are
indispensable
and
independent
of
their
will
these
relations
of
production
correspond
to
a
definite
stage
of
development
of
their
material
forces
of
production
the
sum
total
of
these
relations
of
production
constitutes
the
economic
structure
of
society
—
the
real
foundation
on
which
rises
a
legal
and
political
superstructure
and
to
which
correspond
definite
forms
of
social
consciousness
the
mode
of
production
of
material
life
determines
the
social
political
and
intellectual
life
process
in
general
it
is
not
the
consciousness
of
men
that
determines
their
being
but
on
the
contrary
their
social
being
that
determines
their
consciousness

v
t
e
in
marxism
class
consciousness
is
the
set
of
beliefs
that
persons
hold
regarding
their
social
class
or
economic
rank
in
society
the
structure
of
their
class
and
their
common
class
interests
12
according
to
karl
marx
class
consciousness
is
an
awareness
that
is
key
to
sparking
a
revolution
which
would
create
a
dictatorship
of
the
proletariat
transforming
it
from
a
wageearning
propertyless
mass
into
the
ruling
class
3
although
marxists
tend
to
focus
on
class
consciousness
or
its
absence
among
the
proletariat
the
upper
classes
in
society
can
also
think
and
act
in
a
classconscious
way
as
leonard
fein
pointed
out
the
very
rich
have
been
well
aware
of
their
class
privilege
and
have
labored
mightily
to
protect
and
defend
it
45
for
example
warren
buffett
has
demonstrated
class
consciousness
there
s
class
warfare
all
right
but
it
s
my
class
the
rich
class
that
s
making
war
and
we

marxist
theory
edit
early
in
the
19th
century
the
labels
working
classes
and
middle
classes
were
coming
into
common
usage
in
british
society
david
cody
writes
about
this
time
period
the
old
hereditary
aristocracy
reinforced
by
the
new
gentry
who
owed
their
success
to
commerce
industry
and
the
professions
evolved
into
an
upper
class
its
consciousness
formed
in
large
part
by
the
public
schools
and
universities
which
tenaciously
maintained
control
over
the
political
system
depriving
not
only
the
working
classes
but
the
middle
classes
of
a
voice
in
the
political
process
7
as
the
industrial
revolution
progressed
the
sharpening
of
socioeconomic
divisions
caused
each
group
to
become
more
acutely
conscious
of
its
position
in
the
hierarchy
7
while
karl
marx
rarely
used
the
term
class
consciousness
he
did
make
the
distinction
between
class
in
itself
which
is
defined
as
a
stratum
of
society
sharing
common
grievances
and
a
unified
perspective
and
a
class
for
itself
which
is
defined
as
a
stratum
organized
in
active
pursuit
of
its
own
interests
8
categorizing
a
person
s
social
class
can
be
a
determinant
for
their
awareness
of
it
marxists
categorize
classes
based
on
their
relation
to
the
means
of
production
especially
on
whether
or
not
members
of
the
class
own
capital
nonmarxists
differentiate
society
s
various
groups
based
on
social
stratification
i
e
income
race
gender
ethnicity
education
occupation
or
status
91011
whereas
marx
believed
the
working
class
would
gain
class
consciousness
as
a
result
of
its
experience
of
exploitation
later
orthodox
marxism
in
particular
as
formulated
by
vladimir
lenin
argued
that
the
working
class
by
itself
could
only
develop
trade
union
consciousness
which
lenin
characterized
in
what
is
to
be
done
as
the
conviction
that
it
is
necessary
to
combine
in
unions
fight
the
employers
and
strive
to
compel
the
government
to
pass
necessary
labour
legislation
12
to
overcome
this
in
lenin
s
opinion
limited
worldview
a
vanguard
party
of
the
most
politically
advanced
section
of
the
working
class
was
needed
to
help
replace
trade
union
consciousness
with
class
consciousness
1314
criticism
edit
the
polish
political
philosopher
leszek
kolakowski
disputed
the
notion
that
class
consciousness
could
be
instilled
from
outside
by
a
vanguard
party
in
main
currents
of
marxism
and
his
other
writings
he
stated
that
in
order
to
achieve
a
unity
of
theory
and
praxis
theory
must
not
only
tend
toward
reality
in
an
attempt
to
change
it
reality
must
also
tend
towards
theory
otherwise
the
historical
process
leads
a
life
of
its
own
while
theorists
make
their
own
little
theories
desperately
waiting
for
some
kind
of
possible
influence
over
the
historical
process
henceforth
reality
itself
must
tend
toward
the
theory
making
it
the
expression
of
the
revolutionary
process
itself
in
turn
a
theory
which
has
as
its
goal
helping
the
proletariat
achieve
class
consciousness
must
first
be
an
objective
theory
of
class
consciousness
however
theory
in
itself
is
insufficient
and
ultimately
relies
on
the
struggle
of
humankind
and
of
the
proletariat
for
consciousness
the
objective
theory
of
class
consciousness
is
only
the
theory
of
its
objective
possibility
1516
austrian
school
economist
ludwig
von
mises
asserted
that
marx
confused
the
notions
of
caste
and
class
mises
allowed
that
class
consciousness
and
the
associated
class
struggle
were
valid
concepts
in
some
circumstances
where
rigid
social
castes
exist
e
g
when
slavery
is
legal
and
slaves
have
a
common
motive
for
wanting
to
end
their
disadvantaged
status
relative
to
other
castes
but
that
class
is
an
arbitrary
distinction
in
capitalist
society
where
there
is
equality
before
the
law
mises
believed
that
under
capitalism
one
s
wealth
does
not
very
much
affect
how
one
is
treated
by
legislators
law
enforcement
or
the
courts
17
mises
follower
murray
rothbard
argued
that
marx
s
effort
to
portray
workers
and
capitalists
as
two
monolithic
groups
was
false
because
workers
and
capitalists
routinely
compete
within
themselves
such
as
capitalist
entrepreneurs
competing
with
each
other
for
market
dominance

that

for

among

marxism
being
a
scientific
theory
could
not
be
a
spontaneous
product
of
the
working
class
according
to
lenin
but
had
to
be
imported
from
outside
by
intellectuals
equipped
with
scientific
knowledge
became
the
peculiar
ideological
instrument
to
justify
a
new
idea
of
the
party
of
manipulators
since
the
working
class
is
in
principle
incapable
of
articulating
theoretically
its
consciousness
it
is
possible
and
even
necessary
that
the
genuine
theoretical
consciousness
of
the
working
class
should
be
incarnated
in
a
political
organism
that
could
consider
itself
the
carrier
of
this
consciousness
regardless
of
what
the
empirical
working
class
thought
about
it
given
that
the
empirical
consciousness
of
this
class
is
irrelevant
in
defining
who
in
a
given
moment
represents
its
interest
this
is
why
the
theory
of
class
consciousness
instilled
from
outside
and
the
whole
idea
of
scientific
socialism
so
conceived
served
to
justify
the
fact
that
in
all
kinds
of
political
activity
and
later
in
the
exercise
of
political
power
the
working
class
may
be
and
must
be
replaced
by
the
political
apparatus
which
is
the
vehicle
of
its
consciousness
at
the
highest
level
the
whole
leninist
and
then
stalinist
principle
of
dictatorship
which
the
proletariat
exercises
through
the
intermediary
of
its
selfappointed
representatives
is
only
a
development
of
the
idea
of
scientific
socialism
so
conceived

andy

the
question
is
not
what
goal
is
envisaged
for
the
time
being
by
this
or
that
member
of
the
proletariat
or
even
by
the
proletariat
as
a
whole
the
question
is
what
is
the
proletariat
and
what
course
of
action
will
it
be
forced
historically
to
take
in
conformity
with
its
own
nature
marx
the
holy
family
marx
s
chief
work
breaks
off
just
as
he
is
about
to
embark
on
the
definition
of
class
this
omission
was
to
have
serious
consequences
both
for
the
theory
and
the
practice
of
the
proletariat
for
on
this
vital
point
the
later
movement
was
forced
to
base
itself
on
interpretations
on
the
collation
of
occasional
utterances
by
marx
and
engels
and
on
the
independent
extrapolation
and
application
of
their
method
in
marxism
the
division
of
society
into
classes
is
determined
by
position
within
the
process
of
production
but
what
then
is
the
meaning
of
class
consciousness
the
question
at
once
branches
out
into
a
series
of
closely
interrelated
problems
first
of
all
how
are
we
to
understand
class
consciousness
in
theory
second
what
is
the
practical
function
of
class
consciousness
so
understood
in
the
context
of
the
class
struggle
this
leads
to
the
further
question
is
the
problem
of
class
consciousness
a
general
sociological
problem
or
does
it
mean
one
thing
for
the
proletariat
and
another
for
every
other
class
to
have
emerged
hitherto
and
lastly
is
class
consciousness
homogeneous
in
nature
and
function
or
can
we
discern
different
gradations
and
levels
in
it
and
if
so
what
are
their
practical
implications
for
the
class
struggle
of
the
proletariat
1
in
his
celebrated
account
of
historical
materialism
1
engels
proceeds
from
the
assumption
that
although
the
essence
of
history
consists
in
the
fact
that
“
nothing
happens
without
a
conscious
purpose
or
an
intended
aim
”
to
understand
history
it
is
necessary
to
go
further
than
this
for
on
the
one
hand
“
the
many
individual
wills
active
in
history
for
the
most
part
produce
results
quite
other
than
those
intended
–
often
quite
the
opposite
their
motives
therefore
in
relation
to
the
total
result
are
likewise
of
only
secondary
importance
on
the
other
hand
the
further
question
arises
what
driving
forces
in
turn
stand
behind
these
motives
what
are
the
historical
causes
which
transform
themselves
into
these
motives
in
the
brain
of
the
actors
”
he
goes
on
to
argue
that
these
driving
forces
ought
themselves
to
be
determined
in
particular
those
which
“
set
in
motion
great
masses
whole
peoples
and
again
whole
classes
of
the
people
and
which
create
a
lasting
action
resulting
in
a
great
transformation
”
the
essence
of
scientific
marxism
consists
then
in
the
realisation
that
the
real
motor
forces
of
history
are
independent
of
man
s
psychological
consciousness
of
them
at
a
more
primitive
stage
of
knowledge
this
independence
takes
the
form
of
the
belief
that
these
forces
belong
as
it
were
to
nature
and
that
in
them
and
in
their
causal
interactions
it
is
possible
to
discern
the
eternal
laws
of
nature
as
marx
says
of
bourgeois
thought
“
man
s
reflections
on
the
forms
of
social
life
and
consequently
also
his
scientific
analysis
of
those
forms
take
a
course
directly
opposite
to
that
of
their
actual
historical
development
he
begins
post
festum
with
the
results
of
the
process
of
development
ready
to
hand
before
him
the
characters
have
already
acquired
the
stability
of
natural
selfunderstood
forms
of
social
life
before
man
seeks
to
decipher
not
their
historical
character
for
in
his
eyes
they
are
immutable
but
their
meaning
”
2
this
is
a
dogma
whose
most
important
spokesmen
can
be
found
in
the
political
theory
of
classical
german
philosophy
and
in
the
economic
theory
of
adam
smith
and
ricardo
marx
opposes
to
them
a
critical
philosophy
a
theory
of
theory
and
a
consciousness
of
consciousness
this
critical
philosophy
implies
above
all
historical
criticism
it
dissolves
the
rigid
unhistorical
natural
appearance
of
social
institutions
it
reveals
their
historical
origins
and
shows
therefore
that
they
are
subject
to
history
in
every
respect
including
historical
decline
consequently
history
does
not
merely
unfold
within
the
terrain
mapped
out
by
these
institutions
it
does
not
resolve
itself
into
the
evolution
of
contents
of
men
and
situations
etc
while
the
principles
of
society
remain
eternally
valid
nor
are
these
institutions
the
goal
to
which
all
history
aspires
such
that
when
they
are
realised
history
will
have
fulfilled
her
mission
and
will
then
be
at
an
end
on
the
contrary
history
is
precisely
the
history
of
these
institutions
of
the
changes
they
undergo
as
institutions
which
bring
men
together
in
societies
such
institutions
start
by
controlling
economic
relations
between
men
and
go
on
to
permeate
all
human
relations
and
hence
also
man
s
relations
with
himself
and
with
nature
etc
at
this
point
bourgeois
thought
must
come
up
against
an
insuperable
obstacle
for
its
startingpoint
and
its
goal
are
always
if
not
always
consciously
an
apologia
for
the
existing
order
of
things
or
at
least
the
proof
of
their
immutability
3
“
thus
there
has
been
history
but
there
is
no
longer
any
”
4
marx
observes
with
reference
to
bourgeois
economics
a
dictum
which
applies
with
equal
force
to
all
attempts
by
bourgeois
thinkers
to
understand
the
process
of
history
it
has
often
been
pointed
out
that
this
is
also
one
of
the
defects
of
hegel
s
philosophy
of
history
as
a
result
while
bourgeois
thought
is
indeed
able
to
conceive
of
history
as
a
problem
it
remains
an
intractable
problem
either
it
is
forced
to
abolish
the
process
of
history
and
regard
the
institutions
of
the
present
as
eternal
laws
of
nature
which
for
mysterious
reasons
and
in
a
manner
wholly
at
odds
with
the
principles
of
a
rational
science
were
held
to
have
failed
to
establish
themselves
firmly
or
indeed
at
all
in
the
past
this
is
characteristic
of
bourgeois
sociology
or
else
everything
meaningful
or
purposive
is
banished
from
history
it
then
becomes
impossible
to
advance
beyond
the
mere
individuality
of
the
various
epochs
and
their
social
and
human
representatives
history
must
then
insist
with
ranke
that
every
age
is
“
equally
close
to
god
”
i
e
has
attained
an
equal
degree
of
perfection
and
thatfor
quite
different
reasonsthere
is
no
such
thing
as
historical
development
in
the
first
case
it
ceases
to
be
possible
to
understand
the
origin
of
social
institutions
5
the
objects
of
history
appear
as
the
objects
of
immutable
eternal
laws
of
nature
history
becomes
fossilised
in
a
formalism
incapable
of
comprehending
that
the
real
nature
of
sociohistorical
institutions
is
that
they
consist
of
relations
between
men
on
the
contrary
men
become
estranged
from
this
the
true
source
of
historical
understanding
and
cut
off
from
it
by
an
unbridgeable
gulf
as
marx
points
out
6
people
fail
to
realise
“
that
these
definite
social
relations
are
just
as
much
the
products
of
men
as
linen
flax
etc
”
in
the
second
case
history
is
transformed
into
the
irrational
rule
of
blind
forces
which
is
embodied
at
best
in
the
spirit
of
the
people
or
in
great
men
it
can
therefore
only
be
described
pragmatically
but
it
cannot
be
rationally
understood
its
only
possible
organisation
would
be
aesthetic
as
if
it
were
a
work
of
art
or
else
as
in
the
philosophy
of
history
of
the
kantians
it
must
be
seen
as
the
instrument
senseless
in
itself
by
means
of
which
timeless
suprahistorical
ethical
principles
are
realised
marx
resolves
this
dilemma
by
exposing
it
as
an
illusion
the
dilemma
means
only
that
the
contradictions
of
the
capitalist
system
of
production
are
reflected
in
these
mutually
incompatible
accounts
of
the
same
object
for
in
this
historiography
with
its
search
for
sociological
laws
or
its
formalistic
rationale
we
find
the
reflection
of
man
s
plight
in
bourgeois
society
and
of
his
helpless
enslavement
by
the
forces
of
production
“
to
them
their
own
social
action
”
marx
remarks
7
“
takes
the
form
of
the
action
of
objects
which
rule
the
producers
instead
of
being
ruled
by
them
”
this
law
was
expressed
most
clearly
and
coherently
in
the
purely
natural
and
rational
laws
of
classical
economics
marx
retorted
with
the
demand
for
a
historical
critique
of
economics
which
resolves
the
totality
of
the
reified
objectivities
of
social
and
economic
life
into
relations
between
men
capital
and
with
it
every
form
in
which
the
national
economy
objectives
itself
is
according
to
marx
“
not
a
thing
but
a
social
relation
between
persons
mediated
through
things
”
8
however
by
reducing
the
objectivity
of
the
social
institutions
so
hostile
to
man
to
relations
between
men
marx
also
does
away
with
the
false
implications
of
the
irrationalist
and
individualist
principle
i
e
the
other
side
of
the
dilemma
for
to
eliminate
the
objectivity
attributed
both
to
social
institutions
inimical
to
man
and
to
their
historical
evolution
means
the
restoration
of
this
objectivity
to
their
underlying
basis
to
the
relations
between
men
it
does
not
involve
the
elimination
of
laws
and
objectivity
independent
of
the
will
of
man
and
in
particular
the
wills
and
thoughts
of
individual
men
it
simply
means
that
this
objectivity
is
the
selfobjectification
of
human
society
at
a
particular
stage
in
its
development
its
laws
hold
good
only
within
the
framework
of
the
historical
context
which
produced
them
and
which
is
in
turn
determined
by
them
it
might
look
as
though
by
dissolving
the
dilemma
in
this
manner
we
were
denying
consciousness
any
decisive
role
in
the
process
of
history
it
is
true
that
the
conscious
reflexes
of
the
different
stages
of
economic
growth
remain
historical
facts
of
great
importance
it
is
true
that
while
dialectical
materialism
is
itself
the
product
of
this
process
it
does
not
deny
that
men
perform
their
historical
deeds
themselves
and
that
they
do
so
consciously
but
as
engels
emphasises
in
a
letter
to
mehring
9
this
consciousness
is
false
however
the
dialectical
method
does
not
permit
us
simply
to
proclaim
the
falseness
of
this
consciousness
and
to
persist
in
an
inflexible
confrontation
of
true
and
false
on
the
contrary
it
requires
us
to
investigate
this
false
consciousness
concretely
as
an
aspect
of
the
historical
totality
and
as
a
stage
in
the
historical
process
of
course
bourgeois
historians
also
attempt
such
concrete
analyses
indeed
they
reproach
historical
materialists
with
violating
the
concrete
uniqueness
of
historical
events
where
they
go
wrong
is
in
their
belief
that
the
concrete
can
be
located
in
the
empirical
individual
of
history
individual
here
can
refer
to
an
individual
man
class
or
people
and
in
his
empirically
given
and
hence
psychological
or
masspsychological
consciousness
and
just
when
they
imagine
that
they
have
discovered
the
most
concrete
thing
of
all
society
as
a
concrete
totality
the
system
of
production
at
a
given
point
in
history
and
the
resulting
division
of
society
into
classes
–
they
are
in
fact
at
the
furthest
remove
from
it
in
missing
the
mark
they
mistake
something
wholly
abstract
for
the
concrete
“
these
relations
”
marx
states
“
are
not
those
between
one
individual
and
another
but
between
worker
and
capitalist
tenant
and
landlord
etc
eliminate
these
relations
and
you
abolish
the
whole
of
society
your
prometheus
will
then
be
nothing
more
than
a
spectre
without
arms
or
legs
”
10
concrete
analysis
means
then
the
relation
to
society
as
a
whole
for
only
when
this
relation
is
established
does
the
consciousness
of
their
existence
that
men
have
at
any
given
time
emerge
in
all
its
essential
characteristics
it
appears
on
the
one
hand
as
something
which
is
subjectively
justified
in
the
social
and
historical
situation
as
something
which
can
and
should
be
understood
i
e
as
right
at
the
same
time
objectively
it
bypasses
the
essence
of
the
evolution
of
society
and
fails
to
pinpoint
it
and
express
it
adequately
that
is
to
say
objectively
it
appears
as
a
false
consciousness
on
the
other
hand
we
may
see
the
same
consciousness
as
something
which
fails
subjectively
to
reach
its
selfappointed
goals
while
furthering
and
realising
the
objective
aims
of
society
of
which
it
is
ignorant
and
which
it
did
not
choose
this
twofold
dialectical
determination
of
false
consciousness
constitutes
an
analysis
far
removed
from
the
naive
description
of
what
men
in
fact
thought
felt
and
wanted
at
any
moment
in
history
and
from
any
given
point
in
the
class
structure
i
do
not
wish
to
deny
the
great
importance
of
this
but
it
remains
after
all
merely
the
material
of
genuine
historical
analysis
the
relation
with
concrete
totality
and
the
dialectical
determinants
arising
from
it
transcend
pure
description
and
yield
the
category
of
objective
possibility
by
relating
consciousness
to
the
whole
of
society
it
becomes
possible
to
infer
the
thoughts
and
feelings
which
men
would
have
in
a
particular
situation
if
they
were
able
to
assess
both
it
and
the
interests
arising
from
it
in
their
impact
on
immediate
action
and
on
the
whole
structure
of
society
that
is
to
say
it
would
be
possible
to
infer
the
thoughts
and
feelings
appropriate
to
their
objective
situation
the
number
of
such
situations
is
not
unlimited
in
any
society
however
much
detailed
researches
are
able
to
refine
social
typologies
there
will
always
be
a
number
of
clearly
distinguished
basic
types
whose
characteristics
are
determined
by
the
types
of
position
available
in
the
process
of
production
now
class
consciousness
consists
in
fact
of
the
appropriate
and
rational
reactions
imputed
zugerechnet
to
a
particular
typical
position
in
the
process
of
production
11
this
consciousness
is
therefore
neither
the
sum
nor
the
average
of
what
is
thought
or
felt
by
the
single
individuals
who
make
up
the
class
and
yet
the
historically
significant
actions
of
the
class
as
a
whole
are
determined
in
the
last
resort
by
this
consciousness
and
not
by
the
thought
of
the
individual
–
and
these
actions
can
be
understood
only
by
reference
to
this
consciousness
this
analysis
establishes
right
from
the
start
the
distance
that
separates
class
consciousness
from
the
empirically
given
and
from
the
psychologically
describable
and
explicable
ideas
which
men
form
about
their
situation
in
life
but
it
is
not
enough
just
to
state
that
this
distance
exists
or
even
to
define
its
implications
in
a
formal
and
general
way
we
must
discover
firstly
whether
it
is
a
phenomenon
that
differs
according
to
the
manner
in
which
the
various
classes
are
related
to
society
as
a
whole
and
whether
the
differences
are
so
great
as
to
produce
qualitative
distinctions
and
we
must
discover
secondly
the
practical
significance
of
these
different
possible
relations
between
the
objective
economic
totality
the
imputed
class
consciousness
and
the
real
psychological
thoughts
of
men
about
their
lives
we
must
discover
in
short
the
practical
historical
function
of
class
consciousness
only
after
such
preparatory
formulations
can
we
begin
to
exploit
the
category
of
objective
possibility
systematically
the
first
question
we
must
ask
is
how
far
is
it
intact
possible
to
discern
the
whole
economy
of
a
society
from
inside
it
it
is
essential
to
transcend
the
limitations
of
particular
individuals
caught
up
in
their
own
narrow
prejudices
but
it
is
no
less
vital
not
to
overstep
the
frontier
fixed
for
them
by
the
economic
structure
of
society
and
establishing
their
position
in
it
12
regarded
abstractly
and
formally
then
class
consciousness
implies
a
classconditioned
unconsciousness
of
ones
own
sociohistorical
and
economic
condition
13
this
condition
is
given
as
a
definite
structural
relation
a
definite
formal
nexus
which
appears
to
govern
the
whole
of
life
the
falseness
the
illusion
implicit
in
this
situation
is
in
no
sense
arbitrary
it
is
simply
the
intellectual
reflex
of
the
objective
economic
structure
thus
for
example
“
the
value
or
price
of
labourpower
takes
on
the
appearance
of
the
price
or
value
of
labour
itself
”
and
“
the
illusion
is
created
that
the
totality
is
paid
labour
in
contrast
to
that
under
slavery
even
that
portion
of
labour
which
is
paid
for
appears
unpaid
for
”
14
now
it
requires
the
most
painstaking
historical
analysis
to
use
the
category
of
objective
possibility
so
as
to
isolate
the
conditions
in
which
this
illusion
can
be
exposed
and
a
real
connection
with
the
totality
established
for
if
from
the
vantage
point
of
a
particular
class
the
totality
of
existing
society
is
not
visible
if
a
class
thinks
the
thoughts
imputable
to
it
and
which
bear
upon
its
interests
right
through
to
their
logical
conclusion
and
yet
fails
to
strike
at
the
heart
of
that
totality
then
such
a
class
is
doomed
to
play
only
a
subordinate
role
it
can
never
influence
the
course
of
history
in
either
a
conservative
or
progressive
direction
such
classes
are
normally
condemned
to
passivity
to
an
unstable
oscillation
between
the
ruling
and
the
revolutionary
classes
and
if
perchance
they
do
erupt
then
such
explosions
are
purely
elemental
and
aimless
they
may
win
a
few
battles
but
they
are
doomed
to
ultimate
defeat
for
a
class
to
be
ripe
for
hegemony
means
that
its
interests
and
consciousness
enable
it
to
organise
the
whole
of
society
in
accordance
with
those
interests
the
crucial
question
in
every
class
struggle
is
this
which
class
possesses
this
capacity
and
this
consciousness
at
the
decisive
moment
this
does
not
preclude
the
use
of
force
it
does
not
mean
that
the
classinterests
destined
to
prevail
and
thus
to
uphold
the
interests
of
society
as
a
whole
can
be
guaranteed
an
automatic
victory
on
the
contrary
such
a
transfer
of
power
can
often
only
be
brought
about
by
the
most
ruthless
use
of
force
as
e
g
the
primitive
accumulation
of
capital
but
it
often
turns
out
that
questions
of
class
consciousness
prove
to
be
decisive
in
just
those
situations
where
force
is
unavoidable
and
where
classes
are
locked
in
a
lifeanddeathstruggle
thus
the
noted
hungarian
marxist
erwin
szabo
is
mistaken
in
criticising
engels
for
maintaining
that
the
great
peasant
war
of
1525
was
essentially
a
reactionary
movement
szabo
argues
that
the
peasants
revolt
was
suppressed
only
by
the
ruthless
use
of
force
and
that
its
defeat
was
not
grounded
in
socioeconomic
factors
and
in
the
class
consciousness
of
the
peasants
he
overlooks
the
fact
that
the
deepest
reason
for
the
weakness
of
the
peasantry
and
the
superior
strength
of
the
princes
is
to
be
sought
in
class
consciousness
even
the
most
cursory
student
of
the
military
aspects
of
the
peasants
war
can
easily
convince
himself
of
this
it
must
not
be
thought
however
that
all
classes
ripe
for
hegemony
have
a
class
consciousness
with
the
same
inner
structure
everything
hinges
on
the
extent
to
which
they
can
become
conscious
of
the
actions
they
need
to
perform
in
order
to
obtain
and
organise
power
the
question
then
becomes
how
far
does
the
class
concerned
perform
the
actions
history
has
imposed
on
it
consciously
or
unconsciously
and
is
that
consciousness
true
or
false
these
distinctions
are
by
no
means
academic
quite
apart
from
problems
of
culture
where
such
fissures
and
dissonances
are
crucial
in
all
practical
matters
too
the
fate
of
a
class
depends
on
its
ability
to
elucidate
and
solve
the
problems
with
which
history
confronts
it
and
here
it
becomes
transparently
obvious
that
class
consciousness
is
concerned
neither
with
the
thoughts
of
individuals
however
advanced
nor
with
the
state
of
scientific
knowledge
for
example
it
is
quite
clear
that
ancient
society
was
broken
economically
by
the
limitations
of
a
system
built
on
slavery
but
it
is
equally
clear
that
neither
the
ruling
classes
nor
the
classes
that
rebelled
against
them
in
the
name
of
revolution
or
reform
could
perceive
this
in
consequence
the
practical
emergence
of
these
problems
meant
that
the
society
was
necessarily
and
irremediably
doomed
the
situation
is
even
clearer
in
the
case
of
the
modern
bourgeoisie
which
armed
with
its
knowledge
of
the
workings
of
economics
clashed
with
feudal
and
absolutist
society
for
the
bourgeoisie
was
quite
unable
to
perfect
its
fundamental
science
its
own
science
of
classes
the
reef
on
which
it
foundered
was
its
failure
to
discover
even
a
theoretical
solution
to
the
problem
of
crises
the
fact
that
a
scientifically
acceptable
solution
does
exist
is
of
no
avail
for
to
accept
that
solution
even
in
theory
would
be
tantamount
to
observing
society
from
a
class
standpoint
other
than
that
of
the
bourgeoisie
and
no
class
can
do
that
–
unless
it
is
willing
to
abdicate
its
power
freely
thus
the
barrier
which
converts
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
into
false
consciousness
is
objective
it
is
the
class
situation
itself
it
is
the
objective
result
of
the
economic
setup
and
is
neither
arbitrary
subjective
nor
psychological
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
may
well
be
able
to
reflect
all
the
problems
of
organisation
entailed
by
its
hegemony
and
by
the
capitalist
transformation
and
penetration
of
total
production
but
it
becomes
obscured
as
soon
as
it
is
called
upon
to
face
problems
that
remain
within
its
jurisdiction
but
which
point
beyond
the
limits
of
capitalism
the
discovery
of
the
natural
laws
of
economics
is
pure
light
in
comparison
with
medieval
feudalism
or
even
the
mercantilism
of
the
transitional
period
but
by
an
internal
dialectical
twist
they
became
“
natural
laws
based
on
the
unconsciousness
of
those
who
are
involved
in
them
”
15
it
would
be
beyond
the
scope
of
these
pages
to
advance
further
and
attempt
to
construct
a
historical
and
systematic
typology
of
the
possible
degrees
of
class
consciousness
that
would
require
–
in
the
first
instance
–
an
exact
study
of
the
point
in
the
total
process
of
production
at
which
the
interests
of
the
various
classes
are
most
immediately
and
vitally
involved
secondly
we
would
have
to
show
how
far
it
would
be
in
the
interest
of
any
given
class
to
go
beyond
this
immediacy
to
annul
and
transcend
its
immediate
interest
by
seeing
it
as
a
factor
within
a
totality
and
lastly
what
is
the
nature
of
the
totality
that
is
then
achieved
how
far
does
it
really
embrace
the
true
totality
of
production
it
is
quite
evident
that
the
quality
and
structure
of
class
consciousness
must
be
very
different
if
e
g
it
remains
stationary
at
the
separation
of
consumption
from
production
as
with
the
roman
lumpenproletariat
or
if
it
represents
the
formation
of
the
interests
of
circulation
as
with
merchant
capital
although
we
cannot
embark
on
a
systematic
typology
of
the
various
points
of
view
it
can
be
seen
from
the
foregoing
that
these
specimens
of
false
consciousness
differ
from
each
other
both
qualitatively
structurally
and
in
a
manner
that
is
crucial
for
the
activity
of
the
classes
in
society
2
it
follows
from
the
above
that
for
precapitalist
epochs
and
for
the
behaviour
of
many
strata
within
capitalism
whose
economic
roots
lie
in
precapitalism
class
consciousness
is
unable
to
achieve
complete
clarity
and
to
influence
the
course
of
history
consciously
this
is
true
above
all
because
class
interests
in
precapitalist
society
never
achieve
full
economic
articulation
hence
the
structuring
of
society
into
castes
and
estates
means
that
economic
elements
are
inextricably
joined
to
political
and
religious
factors
in
contrast
to
this
the
rule
of
the
bourgeoisie
means
the
abolition
of
the
estatessystem
and
this
leads
to
the
organisation
of
society
along
class
lines
in
many
countries
vestiges
of
the
feudal
system
still
survive
but
this
does
not
detract
from
the
validity
of
this
observation
this
situation
has
its
roots
in
the
profound
difference
between
capitalist
and
precapitalist
economics
the
most
striking
distinction
and
the
one
that
directly
concerns
us
is
that
precapitalist
societies
are
much
less
cohesive
than
capitalism
the
various
parts
are
much
more
selfsufficient
and
less
closely
interrelated
than
in
capitalism
commerce
plays
a
smaller
role
in
society
the
various
sectors
were
more
autonomous
as
in
the
case
of
village
communes
or
else
plays
no
part
at
all
in
the
economic
life
of
the
community
and
in
the
process
of
production
as
was
true
of
large
numbers
of
citizens
in
greece
and
rome
in
such
circumstances
the
state
i
e
the
organised
unity
remains
insecurely
anchored
in
the
real
life
of
society
one
sector
of
society
simply
lives
out
its
natural
existence
in
what
amounts
to
a
total
independence
of
the
fate
of
the
state
“
the
simplicity
of
the
organisation
for
production
in
these
selfsufficient
communities
that
constantly
reproduce
themselves
in
the
same
form
and
when
accidentally
destroyed
spring
up
again
on
the
spot
and
with
the
same
name
–
this
simplicity
supplies
the
key
to
the
secret
of
the
immutability
of
asiatic
societies
an
immutability
in
such
striking
contrast
with
the
constant
dissolution
and
resounding
of
asiatic
states
and
the
neverceasing
changes
of
dynasty
the
structure
of
the
economic
elements
of
society
remains
untouched
by
the
stormclouds
of
the
political
sky
”
16
yet
another
sector
of
society
is
–
economically
–
completely
parasitic
for
this
sector
the
state
with
its
power
apparatus
is
not
as
it
is
for
the
ruling
classes
under
capitalism
a
means
whereby
to
put
into
practice
the
principles
of
its
economic
power
–
if
need
be
with
the
aid
of
force
nor
is
it
the
instrument
it
uses
to
create
the
conditions
for
its
economic
dominance
as
with
modern
colonialism
that
is
to
say
the
state
is
not
a
mediation
of
the
economic
control
of
society
it
is
that
unmediated
dominance
itself
this
is
true
not
merely
in
cases
of
the
straightforward
theft
of
land
or
slaves
but
also
in
socalled
peaceful
economic
relations
thus
in
connection
with
labourrent
marx
says
“
under
such
circumstances
the
surplus
labour
can
be
extorted
from
them
for
the
benefit
of
the
nominal
landowner
only
by
other
than
economic
pressure
”
in
asia
“
rent
and
taxes
coincide
or
rather
there
is
no
tax
other
than
this
form
of
groundrent
”
17
even
commerce
is
not
able
in
the
forms
it
assumes
in
precapitalist
societies
to
make
decisive
inroads
on
the
basic
structure
of
society
its
impact
remains
superficial
and
the
process
of
production
above
all
in
relation
to
labour
remains
beyond
its
control
“
a
merchant
could
buy
every
commodity
but
labour
as
a
commodity
he
could
not
buy
he
existed
only
on
sufferance
as
a
dealer
in
the
products
of
the
handicrafts
”
18
despite
all
this
every
such
society
constitutes
an
economic
unity
the
only
question
that
arises
is
whether
this
unity
enables
the
individual
sectors
of
society
to
relate
to
society
as
a
whole
in
such
a
way
that
their
imputed
consciousness
can
assume
an
economic
form
marx
emphasises
19
that
in
greece
and
rome
the
class
struggle
“
chiefly
took
the
form
of
a
conflict
between
debtors
and
creditors
”
but
he
also
makes
the
further
very
valid
point
“
nevertheless
the
moneyrelationship
–
and
the
relationship
of
creditor
to
debtor
is
one
of
money
–
reflects
only
the
deeperlying
antagonism
between
the
economic
conditions
of
existence
”
historical
materialism
showed
that
this
reflection
was
no
more
than
a
reflection
but
we
must
go
on
to
ask
was
it
at
all
possible
–
objectively
–
for
the
classes
in
such
a
society
to
become
conscious
of
the
economic
basis
of
these
conflicts
and
of
the
economic
problems
with
which
the
society
was
afflicted
was
it
not
inevitable
that
these
conflicts
and
problems
should
assume
either
natural
religious
forms
20
or
else
political
and
legal
ones
depending
on
circumstances
the
division
of
society
into
estates
or
castes
means
in
effect
that
conceptually
and
organisationally
these
natural
forms
are
established
without
their
economic
basis
ever
becoming
conscious
it
means
that
there
is
no
mediation
between
the
pure
traditionalism
of
natural
growth
and
the
legal
institutions
it
assumes
21
in
accordance
with
the
looser
economic
structure
of
society
the
political
and
legal
institutions
here
the
division
into
estates
privileges
etc
have
different
functions
objectively
and
subjectively
from
those
exercised
under
capitalism
in
capitalism
these
institutions
merely
imply
the
stabilisation
of
purely
economic
forces
so
that
–
as
karner
has
ably
demonstrated
22
–
they
frequently
adapt
themselves
to
changed
economic
structures
without
changing
themselves
in
form
or
content
by
contrast
in
precapitalist
societies
legal
institutions
intervene
substantively
in
the
interplay
of
economic
forces
in
fact
there
are
no
purely
economic
categories
to
appear
or
to
be
given
legal
form
and
according
to
marx
economic
categories
are
“
forms
of
existence
determinations
of
life
”
23
economic
and
legal
categories
are
objectively
and
substantively
so
interwoven
as
to
be
inseparable
consider
here
the
instances
cited
earlier
of
labourrent
and
taxes
of
slavery
etc
in
hegel
s
parlance
the
economy
has
not
even
objectively
reached
the
stage
of
beingforitself
there
is
therefore
no
possible
position
within
such
a
society
from
which
the
economic
basis
of
all
social
relations
could
be
made
conscious
this
is
not
of
course
to
deny
the
objective
economic
foundations
of
social
institutions
on
the
contrary
the
history
of
feudal
estates
shows
very
clearly
that
what
in
origin
had
been
a
natural
economic
existence
cast
into
stable
forms
begins
gradually
to
disintegrate
as
a
result
of
subterranean
unconscious
economic
development
that
is
to
say
it
ceases
to
be
a
real
unity
their
economic
content
destroys
the
unity
of
their
juridical
form
ample
proof
of
this
is
furnished
both
by
engels
in
his
analysis
of
the
class
struggles
of
the
reformation
period
and
by
cunow
in
his
discussion
of
the
french
revolution
however
despite
this
conflict
between
juridical
form
and
economic
content
the
juridical
privilegecreating
forms
retain
a
great
and
often
absolutely
crucial
importance
for
the
consciousness
of
estates
in
the
process
of
disintegration
for
the
form
of
the
estates
conceals
the
connection
between
the
–
real
but
unconscious
–
economic
existence
of
the
estate
and
the
economic
totality
of
society
it
fixates
consciousness
directly
on
its
privileges
as
in
the
case
of
the
knights
during
the
reformation
or
else
–
no
less
directly
–
on
the
particular
element
of
society
from
which
the
privileges
emanated
as
in
the
case
of
the
guilds
even
when
an
estate
has
disintegrated
even
when
its
members
have
been
absorbed
economically
into
a
number
of
different
classes
it
still
retains
this
objectively
unreal
ideological
coherence
for
the
relation
to
the
whole
created
by
the
consciousness
of
one
s
status
is
not
directed
to
the
real
living
economic
unity
but
to
a
past
state
of
society
as
constituted
by
the
privileges
accorded
to
the
estates
status
–
consciousness
–
a
real
historical
factor
masks
class
consciousness
in
fact
it
prevents
it
from
emerging
at
all
a
like
phenomenon
can
be
observed
under
capitalism
in
the
case
of
all
privileged
groups
whose
class
situation
lacks
any
immediate
economic
base
the
ability
of
such
a
class
to
adapt
itself
to
the
real
economic
development
can
be
measured
by
the
extent
to
which
it
succeeds
in
capitalising
itself
i
e
transforming
its
privileges
into
economic
and
capitalist
forms
of
control
as
was
the
case
with
the
great
landowners
thus
class
consciousness
has
quite
a
different
relation
to
history
in
precapitalist
and
capitalist
periods
in
the
former
case
the
classes
could
only
be
deduced
from
the
immediately
given
historical
reality
by
the
methods
of
historical
materialism
in
capitalism
they
themselves
constitute
this
immediately
given
historical
reality
it
is
therefore
no
accident
that
as
engels
too
has
pointed
out
this
knowledge
of
history
only
became
possible
with
the
advent
of
capitalism
not
only
–
as
engels
believed
–
because
of
the
greater
simplicity
of
capitalism
in
contrast
to
the
complex
and
concealed
relations
of
earlier
ages
but
primarily
because
only
with
capitalism
does
economic
class
interest
emerge
in
all
its
starkness
as
the
motor
of
history
in
precapitalist
periods
man
could
never
become
conscious
not
even
by
virtue
of
an
imputed
consciousness
of
the
“
true
driving
forces
which
stand
behind
the
motives
of
human
actions
in
history
”
they
remained
hidden
behind
motives
and
were
in
truth
the
blind
forces
of
history
ideological
factors
do
not
merely
mask
economic
interests
they
are
not
merely
the
banners
and
slogans
they
are
the
parts
the
components
of
which
the
real
struggle
is
made
of
course
if
historical
materialism
is
deployed
to
discover
the
sociological
meaning
of
these
struggles
economic
interests
will
doubtless
be
revealed
as
the
decisive
factors
in
any
explanation
but
there
is
still
an
unbridgeable
gulf
between
this
and
capitalism
where
economic
factors
are
not
concealed
behind
consciousness
but
are
present
in
consciousness
itself
albeit
unconsciously
or
repressed
with
capitalism
with
the
abolition
of
the
feudal
estates
and
with
the
creation
of
a
society
with
a
purely
economic
articulation
class
consciousness
arrived
at
the
point
where
it
could
become
conscious
from
then
on
social
conflict
was
reflected
in
an
ideological
struggle
for
consciousness
and
for
the
veiling
or
the
exposure
of
the
class
character
of
society
but
the
fact
that
this
conflict
became
possible
points
forward
to
the
dialectical
contradictions
and
the
internal
dissolution
of
pure
class
society
in
hegel
s
words
“
when
philosophy
paints
its
gloomy
picture
a
form
of
life
has
grown
old
it
cannot
be
rejuvenated
by
the
gloomy
picture
but
only
understood
only
when
dusk
starts

fall
does
the

bourgeoisie
and
proletariat
are
the
only
pure
classes
in
bourgeois
society
they
are
the
only
classes
whose
existence
and
development
are
entirely
dependent
on
the
course
taken
by
the
modern
evolution
of
production
and
only
from
the
vantage
point
of
these
classes
can
a
plan
for
the
total
organisation
of
society
even
be
imagined
the
outlook
of
the
other
classes
petty
bourgeois
or
peasants
is
ambiguous
or
sterile
because
their
existence
is
not
based
exclusively
on
their
role
in
the
capitalist
system
of
production
but
is
indissolubly
linked
with
the
vestiges
of
feudal
society
their
aim
therefore
is
not
to
advance
capitalism
or
to
transcend
it
but
to
reverse
its
action
or
at
least
to
prevent
it
from
developing
fully
their
class
interest
concentrates
on
symptoms
of
development
and
not
on
development
itself
and
on
elements
of
society
rather
than
on
the
construction
of
society
as
a
whole
the
question
of
consciousness
may
make
its
appearance
in
terms
of
the
objectives
chosen
or
in
terms
of
action
as
for
instance
in
the
case
of
the
petty
bourgeoisie
this
class
lives
at
least
in
part
in
the
capitalist
big
city
and
every
aspect
of
its
existence
is
directly
exposed
to
the
influence
of
capitalism
hence
it
cannot
possibly
remain
wholly
unaffected
by
the
fact
of
class
conflict
between
bourgeoisie
and
proletariat
but
as
a
“
transitional
class
in
which
the
interests
of
two
other
classes
become
simultaneously
blunted
”
it
will
imagine
itself
“
to
be
above
all
class
antagonisms
”
24
accordingly
it
will
search
for
ways
whereby
it
will
“
not
indeed
eliminate
the
two
extremes
of
capital
and
wage
labour
but
will
weaken
their
antagonism
and
transform
it
into
harmony
”
25
in
all
decisions
crucial
for
society
its
actions
will
be
irrelevant
and
it
will
be
forced
to
fight
for
both
sides
in
turn
but
always
without
consciousness
in
so
doing
its
own
objectives
–
which
exist
exclusively
in
its
own
consciousness
–
must
become
progressively
weakened
and
increasingly
divorced
from
social
action
ultimately
they
will
assume
purely
ideological
forms
the
petty
bourgeoisie
will
only
be
able
to
play
an
active
role
in
history
as
long
as
these
objectives
happen
to
coincide
with
the
real
economic
interests
of
capitalism
this
was
the
case
with
the
abolition
of
the
feudal
estates
during
the
french
revolution
with
the
fulfilment
of
this
mission
its
utterances
which
for
the
most
part
remain
unchanged
in
form
become
more
and
more
remote
from
real
events
and
turn
finally
into
mere
caricatures
this
was
true
e
g
of
the
jacobinism
of
the
montagne
184851
this
isolation
from
society
as
a
whole
has
its
repercussions
on
the
internal
structure
of
the
class
and
its
organisational
potential
this
can
be
seen
most
clearly
in
the
development
of
the
peasantry
marx
says
on
this
point
26
“
the
smallholding
peasants
form
a
vast
mass
whose
members
live
in
similar
conditions
but
without
entering
into
manifold
relations
with
each
other
their
mode
of
production
isolates
them
from
one
another
instead
of
bringing
them
into
mutual
intercourse
every
single
peasant
family
thus
acquires
its
means
of
life
more
through
exchange
with
nature
than
in
intercourse
with
society
in
so
far
as
millions
of
families
live
under
economic
conditions
of
existence
that
separate
their
mode
of
life
their
interests
and
their
culture
from
those
of
other
classes
and
place
them
in
opposition
to
them
they
constitute
a
class
in
so
far
as
there
is
only
a
local
connection
between
the
smallholding
peasants
and
the
identity
of
their
interests
begets
no
community
no
national
unity
and
no
political
organisation
they
do
not
constitute
a
class
”
hence
external
upheavals
such
as
war
revolution
in
the
towns
etc
are
needed
before
these
masses
can
coalesce
in
a
unified
movement
and
even
then
they
are
incapable
of
organising
it
and
supplying
it
with
slogans
and
a
positive
direction
corresponding
to
their
own
interests
whether
these
movements
will
be
progressive
as
in
the
french
revolution
of
1789
or
the
russian
revolution
of
1917
or
reactionary
as
with
napoleon
s
coup
d
état
will
depend
on
the
position
of
the
other
classes
involved
in
the
conflict
and
on
the
level
of
consciousness
of
the
parties
that
lead
them
for
this
reason
too
the
ideological
form
taken
by
the
class
consciousness
of
the
peasants
changes
its
content
more
frequently
than
that
of
other
classes
this
is
because
it
is
always
borrowed
from
elsewhere
hence
parties
that
base
themselves
wholly
or
in
part
on
this
class
consciousness
always
lack
really
firm
and
secure
support
in
critical
situations
as
was
true
of
the
socialist
revolutionaries
in
1917
and
1918
this
explains
why
it
is
possible
for
peasant
conflicts
to
be
fought
out
under
opposing
flags
thus
it
is
highly
characteristic
of
both
anarchism
and
the
class
consciousness
of
the
peasantry
that
a
number
of
counterrevolutionary
rebellions
and
uprisings
of
the
middle
and
upper
strata
of
the
peasantry
in
russia
should
have
found
the
anarchist
view
of
society
to
be
a
satisfying
ideology
we
cannot
really
speak
of
class
consciousness
in
the
case
of
these
classes
if
indeed
we
can
even
speak
of
them
as
classes
in
the
strict
marxist
sense
of
the
term
for
a
full
consciousness
of
their
situation
would
reveal
to
them
the
hopelessness
of
their
particularise
strivings
in
the
face
of
the
inevitable
course
of
events
consciousness
and
selfinterest
then
are
mutually
incompatible
in
this
instance
and
as
class
consciousness
was
defined
in
terms
of
the
problems
of
imputing
class
interests
the
failure
of
their
class
consciousness
to
develop
in
the
immediately
given
historical
reality
becomes
comprehensible
philosophically
with
the
bourgeoisie
also
class
consciousness
stands
in
opposition
to
class
interest
but
here
the
antagonism
is
not
contradictory
but
dialectical
the
distinction
between
the
two
modes
of
contradiction
may
be
briefly
described
in
this
way
in
the
case
of
the
other
classes
a
class
consciousness
is
prevented
from
emerging
by
their
position
within
the
process
of
production
and
the
interests
this
generates
in
the
case
of
the
bourgeoisie
however
these
factors
combine
to
produce
a
class
consciousness
but
one
which
is
cursed
by
its
very
nature
with
the
tragic
fate
of
developing
an
insoluble
contradiction
at
the
very
zenith
of
its
powers
as
a
result
of
this
contradiction
it
must
annihilate
itself
the
tragedy
of
the
bourgeoisie
is
reflected
historically
in
the
fact
that
even
before
it
had
defeated
its
predecessor
feudalism
its
new
enemy
the
proletariat
had
appeared
on
the
scene
politically
it
became
evident
when
at
the
moment
of
victory
the
freedom
in
whose
name
the
bourgeoisie
had
joined
battle
wit
i
feudalism
was
transformed
into
a
new
repressiveness
sociologically
the
bourgeoisie
did
everything
in
its
power
to
eradicate
the
fact
of
class
conflict
from
the
consciousness
of
society
even
though
class
conflict
had
only
emerged
in
its
purity
and
became
established
as
an
historical
fact
with
the
advent
of
capitalism
ideologically
we
see
the
same
contradiction
in
the
fact
that
the
bourgeoisie
endowed
the
individual
with
an
unprecedented
importance
but
at
the
same
time
that
same
individuality
was
annihilated
by
the
economic
conditions
to
which
it
was
subjected
by
the
reification
created
by
commodity
production
all
these
contradictions
and
the
list
might
be
extended
indefinitely
are
only
the
reflection
of
the
deepest
contradictions
in
capitalism
itself
as
they
appear
in
the
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
in
accordance
with
their
position
in
the
total
system
of
production
for
this
reason
they
appear
as
dialectical
contradictions
in
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
they
do
not
merely
reflect
the
inability
of
the
bourgeoisie
to
grasp
the
contradictions
inherent
in
its
own
social
order
for
on
the
one
hand
capitalism
is
the
first
system
of
production
able
to
achieve
a
total
economic
penetration
of
society
27
and
this
implies
that
in
theory
the
bourgeoisie
should
be
able
to
progress
from
this
central
point
to
the
possession
of
an
imputed
class
consciousness
of
the
whole
system
of
production
on
the
other
hand
the
position
held
by
the
capitalist
class
and
the
interests
which
determine
its
actions
ensure
that
it
will
be
unable
to
control
its
own
system
of
production
even
in
theory
there
are
many
reasons
for
this
in
the
first
place
it
only
seems
to
be
true
that
for
capitalism
production
occupies
the
centre
of
class
consciousness
and
hence
provides
the
theoretical
startingpoint
for
analysis
with
reference
to
ricardo
“
who
had
been
reproached
with
an
exclusive
concern
with
production
”
marx
emphasised
28
that
he
“
defined
distribution
as
the
sole
subject
of
economics
”
and
the
detailed
analysis
of
the
process
by
which
capital
is
concretely
realised
shows
in
every
single
instance
that
the
interest
of
the
capitalist
who
produces
not
goods
but
commodities
is
necessarily
confined
to
matters
that
must
be
peripheral
in
terms
of
production
moreover
the
capitalist
enmeshed
in
what
is
for
him
the
decisive
process
of
the
expansion
of
capital
must
have
a
standpoint
from
which
the
most
important
problems
become
quite
invisible
29
the
discrepancies
that
result
are
further
exacerbated
by
the
fact
that
there
is
an
insoluble
contradiction
running
through
the
internal
structure
of
capitalism
between
the
social
and
the
individual
principle
i
e
between
the
function
of
capital
as
private
property
and
its
objective
economic
function
as
the
communist
manifesto
states
“
capital
is
a
social
force
and
not
a
personal
one
”
but
it
is
a
social
force
whose
movements
are
determined
by
the
individual
interests
of
the
owners
of
capital
–
who
cannot
see
and
who
are
necessarily
indifferent
to
all
the
social
implications
of
their
activities
hence
the
social
principle
and
the
social
function
implicit
in
capital
can
only
prevail
unbeknown
to
them
and
as
it
were
against
their
will
and
behind
their
backs
because
of
this
conflict
between
the
individual
and
the
social
marx
rightly
characterised
the
stock
companies
as
the
“
negation
of
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
itself
”
30
of
course
it
is
true
that
stock
companies
differ
only
in
inessentials
from
individual
capitalists
and
even
the
socalled
abolition
of
the
anarchy
in
production
through
cartels
and
trusts
only
shifts
the
contradiction
elsewhere
without
however
eliminating
it
this
situation
forms
one
of
the
decisive
factors
governing
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
it
is
true
that
the
bourgeoisie
acts
as
a
class
in
the
objective
evolution
of
society
but
it
understands
the
process
which
it
is
itself
instigating
as
something
external
which
is
subject
to
objective
laws
which
it
can
only
experience
passively
bourgeois
thought
observes
economic
life
consistently
and
necessarily
from
the
standpoint
of
the
individual
capitalist
and
this
naturally
produces
a
sharp
confrontation
between
the
individual
and
the
overpowering
suprapersonal
law
of
nature
which
propels
all
social
phenomena
31
this
leads
both
to
the
antagonism
between
individual
and
class
interests
in
the
event
of
conflict
which
it
is
true
rarely
becomes
as
acute
among
the
ruling
classes
as
in
the
bourgeoisie
and
also
to
the
logical
impossibility
of
discovering
theoretical
and
practical
solutions
to
the
problems
created
by
the
capitalist
system
of
production
this
sudden
reversion
from
a
system
of
credit
to
a
system
of
hard
cash
heaps
theoretical
fright
on
top
of
practical
panic
and
the
dealers
by
whose
agency
circulation
is
effected
shudder
before
the
impenetrable
mystery
in
which
their
own
economic
relations
are
shrouded
”
32
this
terror
is
not
unfounded
that
is
to
say
it
is
much
more
than
the
bafflement
felt
by
the
individual
capitalist
when
confronted
by
his
own
individual
fate
the
facts
and
the
situations
which
induce
this
panic
force
something
into
the
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
which
is
too
much
of
a
brute
fact
for
its
existence
to
be
wholly
denied
or
repressed
but
equally
it
is
something
that
the
bourgeoisie
can
never
fully
understand
for
the
recognisable
background
to
this
situation
is
the
fact
that
“
the
real
barrier
of
capitalist
production
is
capital
itself
”
33
and
if
this
insight
were
to
become
conscious
it
would
indeed
entail
the
selfnegation
of
the
capitalist
class
in
this
way
the
objective
limits
of
capitalist
production
become
the
limits
of
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
the
older
natural
and
conservative
forms
of
domination
had
left
unmolested
34
the
forms
of
production
of
whole
sections
of
the
people
they
ruled
and
therefore
exerted
by
and
large
a
traditional
and
unrevolutionary
influence
capitalism
by
contrast
is
a
revolutionary
form
par
excellence
the
fact
that
it
must
necessarily
remain
in
ignorance
of
the
objective
economic
limitations
of
its
own
system
expresses
itself
as
an
internal
dialectical
contradiction
in
its
class
consciousness
this
means
that
formally
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
is
geared
to
economic
consciousness
and
indeed
the
highest
degree
of
unconsciousness
the
crassest
form
of
false
consciousness
always
manifests
itself
when
the
conscious
mastery
of
economic
phenomena
appears
to
be
at
its
greatest
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
relation
of
consciousness
to
society
this
contradiction
is
expressed
as
the
irreconcilable
antagonism
between
ideology
and
economic
base
its
dialectics
are
grounded
in
the
irreconcilable
antagonism
between
the
capitalist
individual
i
e
the
stereotyped
individual
of
capitalism
and
the
natural
and
inevitable
process
of
development
i
e
the
process
not
subject
to
consciousness
in
consequence
theory
and
practice
are
brought
into
irreconcilable
opposition
to
each
other
but
the
resulting
dualism
is
anything
but
stable
in
fact
it
constantly
strives
to
harmonise
principles
that
have
been
wrenched
apart
and
thenceforth
oscillate
between
a
new
false
synthesis
and
its
subsequent
cataclysmic
disruption
this
internal
dialectical
contradiction
in
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
is
further
aggravated
by
the
fact
that
the
objective
limits
of
capitalism
do
not
remain
purely
negative
that
is
to
say
that
capitalism
does
not
merely
set
natural
laws
in
motion
that
provoke
crises
which
it
cannot
comprehend
on
the
contrary
those
limits
acquire
a
historical
embodiment
with
its
own
consciousness
and
its
own
actions
the
proletariat
most
normal
shifts
of
perspective
produced
by
the
capitalist
point
of
view
in
the
image
of
the
economic
structure
of
society
tend
to
“
obscure
and
mystify
the
true
origin
of
surplus
value
”
35
in
the
normal
purely
theoretical
view
this
mystification
only
attaches
to
the
organic
composition
of
capital
viz
to
the
place
of
the
employer
in
the
productive
system
and
the
economic
function
of
interest
etc
i
e
it
does
no
more
than
highlight
the
failure
of
observers
to
perceive
the
true
driving
forces
that
lie
beneath
the
surface
but
when
it
comes
to
practice
this
mystification
touches
upon
the
central
fact
of
capitalist
society
the
class
struggle
in
the
class
struggle
we
witness
the
emergence
of
all
the
hidden
forces
that
usually
lie
concealed
behind
the
façade
of
economic
life
at
which
the
capitalists
and
their
apologists
gaze
as
though
transfixed
these
forces
appear
in
such
a
way
that
they
cannot
possibly
be
ignored
so
much
so
that
even
when
capitalism
was
in
the
ascendant
and
the
proletariat
could
only
give
vent
to
its
protests
in
the
form
of
vehement
spontaneous
explosions
even
the
ideological
exponents
of
the
rising
bourgeoisie
acknowledged
the
class
struggle
as
a
basic
fact
of
history
for
example
marat
and
later
historians
such
as
mignet
but
in
proportion
as
the
theory
and
practice
of
the
proletariat
made
society
conscious
of
this
unconscious
revolutionary
principle
inherent
in
capitalism
the
bourgeoisie
was
thrown
back
increasingly
on
to
a
conscious
defensive
the
dialectical
contradiction
in
the
false
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
became
more
and
more
acute
the
false
consciousness
was
converted
into
a
mendacious
consciousness
what
had
been
at
first
an
objective
contradiction
now
became
subjective
also
the
theoretical
problem
turned
into
a
moral
posture
which
decisively
influenced
every
practical
class
attitude
in
every
situation
and
on
every
issue
thus
the
situation
in
which
the
bourgeoisie
finds
itself
determines
the
function
of
its
class
consciousness
in
its
struggle
to
achieve
control
of
society
the
hegemony
of
the
bourgeoisie
really
does
embrace
the
whole
of
society
it
really
does
attempt
to
organise
the
whole
of
society
in
its
own
interests
and
in
this
it
has
had
some
success
to
achieve
this
it
was
forced
both
to
develop
a
coherent
theory
of
economics
politics
and
society
which
in
itself
presupposes
and
amounts
to
a
weltanschauung
and
also
to
make
conscious
and
sustain
its
faith
in
its
own
mission
to
control
and
organise
society
the
tragic
dialectics
of
the
bourgeoisie
can
be
seen
in
the
fact
that
it
is
not
only
desirable
but
essential
for
it
to
clarify
its
own
class
interests
on
every
particular
issue
while
at
the
same
time
such
a
clear
awareness
becomes
fatal
when
it
is
extended
to
the
question
of
the
totality
the
chief
reason
for
this
is
that
the
rule
of
the
bourgeoisie
can
only
be
the
rule
of
a
minority
its
hegemony
is
exercised
not
merely
by
a
minority
but
in
the
interest
of
that
minority
so
the
need
to
deceive
the
other
classes
and
to
ensure
that
their
class
consciousness
remains
amorphous
is
inescapable
for
a
bourgeois
regime
consider
here
the
theory
of
the
state
that
stands
above
class
antagonisms
or
the
notion
of
an
impartial
system
of
justice
but
the
veil
drawn
over
the
nature
of
bourgeois
society
is
indispensable
to
the
bourgeoisie
itself
for
the
insoluble
internal
contradictions
of
the
system
become
revealed
with
increasing
starkness
and
so
confront
its
supporters
with
a
choice
either
they
must
consciously
ignore
insights
which
become
increasingly
urgent
or
else
they
must
suppress
their
own
moral
instincts
in
order
to
be
able
to
support
with
a
good
conscience
an
economic
system
that
serves
only
their
own
interests
without
overestimating
the
efficacy
of
such
ideological
factors
it
must
be
agreed
that
the
fighting
power
of
a
class
grows
with
its
ability
to
carry
out
its
own
mission
with
a
good
conscience
and
to
adapt
all
phenomena
to
its
own
interests
with
unbroken
confidence
in
itself
if
we
consider
sismondi
s
criticism
of
classical
economics
german
criticisms
of
natural
law
and
the
youthful
critiques
of
carlyle
it
becomes
evident
that
from
a
very
early
stage
the
ideological
history
of
the
bourgeoisie
was
nothing
but
a
desperate
resistance
to
every
insight
into
the
true
nature
of
the
society
it
had
created
and
thus
to
a
real
understanding
of
its
class
situation
when
the
communist
manifesto
makes
the
point
that
the
bourgeoisie
produces
its
own
gravediggers
this
is
valid
ideologically
as
well
as
economically
the
whole
of
bourgeois
thought
in
the
nineteenth
century
made
the
most
strenuous
efforts
to
mask
the
real
foundations
of
bourgeois
society
everything
was
tried
from
the
greatest
falsifications
of
fact
to
the
sublime
theories
about
the
essence
of
history
and
the
state
but
in
vain
with
the
end
of
the
century
the
issue
was
resolved
by
the
advances
of
science
and
their
corresponding
effects
on
the
consciousness
of
the
capitalist
elite
this
can
be
seen
very
clearly
in
the
bourgeoisie
s
greater
readiness
to
accept
the
idea
of
conscious
organisation
a
greater
measure
of
concentration
was
achieved
first
in
the
stock
companies
and
in
the
cartels
and
trusts
this
process
revealed
the
social
character
of
capital
more
and
more
clearly
without
affecting
the
general
anarchy
in
production
what
it
did
was
to
confer
nearmonopoly
status
on
a
number
of
giant
individual
capitalists
objectively
then
the
social
character
of
capital
was
brought
into
play
with
great
energy
but
in
such
a
manner
as
to
keep
its
nature
concealed
from
the
capitalist
class
indeed
this
illusory
elimination
of
economic
anarchy
successfully
diverted
their
attention
from
the
true
situation
with
the
crises
of
the
war
and
the
postwar
period
this
tendency
has
advanced
still
further
the
idea
of
a
planned
economy
has
gained
ground
at
least
among
the
more
progressive
elements
of
the
bourgeoisie
admittedly
this
applies
only
within
quite
harrow
strata
of
the
bourgeoisie
and
even
there
it
is
thought
of
more
as
a
theoretical
experiment
than
as
a
practical
way
out
of
the
impasse
brought
about
by
the
crises
when
capitalism
was
still
expanding
it
rejected
every
sort
of
social
organisation
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
“
an
inroad
upon
such
sacred
things
as
the
rights
of
property
freedom
and
unrestricted
play
for
the
initiative
of
the
individual
capitalist
”
36
if
we
compare
that
with
current
attempts
to
harmonise
a
planned
economy
with
the
class
interests
of
the
bourgeoisie
we
are
forced
to
admit
that
what
we
are
witnessing
is
the
capitulation
of
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
before
that
of
the
proletariat
of
course
the
section
of
the
bourgeoisie
that
accepts
the
notion
of
a
planned
economy
does
not
mean
by
it
the
same
as
does
the
proletariat
it
regards
it
as
a
last
attempt
to
save
capitalism
by
driving
its
internal
contradictions
to
breakingpoint
nevertheless
this
means
jettisoning
the
last
theoretical
line
of
defence
as
a
strange
counterpart
to
this
we
may
note
that
at
just
this
point
in
time
certain
sectors
of
the
proletariat
capitulate
before
the
bourgeoisie
and
adopt
this
the
most
problematic
form
of
bourgeois
organisation
with
this
the
whole
existence
of
the
bourgeoisie
and
its
culture
is
plunged
into
the
most
terrible
crisis
on
the
one
hand
we
find
the
utter
sterility
of
an
ideology
divorced
from
life
of
a
more
or
less
conscious
attempt
at
forgery
on
the
other
hand
a
cynicism
no
less
terribly
jejune
lives
on
in
the
worldhistorical
irrelevances
and
nullities
of
its
own
existence
and
concerns
itself
only
with
the
defence
of
that
existence
and
with
its
own
naked
selfinterest
this
ideological
crisis
is
an
unfailing
sign
of
decay
the
bourgeoisie
has
already
been
thrown
on
the
defensive
however
aggressive
its
weapons
may
be
it
is
fighting
for
selfpreservation
its
power
to
dominate
has
vanished
beyond
recall
4
in
this
struggle
for
consciousness
historical
materialism
plays
a
crucial
role
ideologically
no
less
than
economically
the
bourgeoisie
and
the
proletariat
are
mutually
interdependent
the
same
process
that
the
bourgeoisie
experiences
as
a
permanent
crisis
and
gradual
dissolution
appears
to
the
proletariat
likewise
in
crisisform
as
the
gathering
of
strength
and
the
springboard
to
victory
ideologically
this
means
that
the
same
growth
of
insight
into
the
nature
of
society
which
reflects
the
protracted
death
struggle
of
the
bourgeoisie
entails
a
steady
growth
in
the
strength
of
the
proletariat
for
the
proletariat
the
truth
is
a
weapon
that
brings
victory
and
the
more
ruthless
the
greater
the
victory
this
makes
more
comprehensible
the
desperate
fury
with
which
bourgeois
science
assails
historical
materialism
for
as
soon
as
the
bourgeoisie
is
forced
to
take
up
its
stand
on
this
terrain
it
is
lost
and
at
the
same
time
this
explains
why
the
proletariat
and
only
the
proletariat
can
discern
in
the
correct
understanding
of
the
nature
of
society
a
powerfactor
of
the
first
and
perhaps
decisive
importance
the
unique
function
of
consciousness
in
the
class
struggle
of
the
proletariat
has
consistently
been
overlooked
by
the
vulgar
marxists
who
have
substituted
a
petty
realpolitik
for
the
great
battle
of
principle
which
reaches
back
to
the
ultimate
problems
of
the
objective
economic
process
naturally
we
do
not
wish
to
deny
that
the
proletariat
must
proceed
from
the
facts
of
a
given
situation
but
it
is
to
be
distinguished
from
other
classes
by
the
fact
that
it
goes
beyond
the
contingencies
of
history
far
from
being
driven
forward
by
them
it
is
itself
their
driving
force
and
impinges
centrally
upon
the
process
of
social
change
when
the
vulgar
marxists
detach
themselves
from
this
central
point
of
view
i
e
from
the
point
where
a
proletarian
class
consciousness
arises
they
thereby
place
themselves
on
the
level
of
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
and
that
the
bourgeoisie
fighting
on
its
own
ground
will
prove
superior
to
the
proletariat
both
economically
and
ideologically
can
come
as
a
surprise
only
to
a
vulgar
marxist
moreover
only
a
vulgar
marxist
would
infer
from
this
fact
which
after
all
derives
exclusively
from
his
own
attitude
that
the
bourgeoisie
generally
occupies
the
stronger
position
for
quite
apart
from
the
very
real
force
at
its
disposal
it
is
selfevident
that
the
bourgeoisie
fighting
on
its
own
ground
will
be
both
more
experienced
and
more
expert
nor
will
it
come
as
a
surprise
if
the
bourgeoisie
automatically
obtains
the
upper
hand
when
its
opponents
abandon
their
own
position
for
that
of
the
bourgeoisie
as
the
bourgeoisie
has
the
intellectual
organisational
and
every
other
advantage
the
superiority
of
the
proletariat
must
lie
exclusively
in
its
ability
to
see
society
from
the
centre
as
a
coherent
whole
this
means
that
it
is
able
to
act
in
such
a
way
as
to
change
reality
in
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
theory
and
practice
coincide
and
so
it
can
consciously
throw
the
weight
of
its
actions
onto
the
scales
of
history
–
and
this
is
the
deciding
factor
when
the
vulgar
marxists
destroy
this
unity
they
cut
the
nerve
that
binds
proletarian
theory
to
proletarian
action
they
reduce
theory
to
the
scientific
treatment
of
the
symptoms
of
social
change
and
as
for
practice
they
are
themselves
reduced
to
being
buffeted
about
aimlessly
and
uncontrollably
by
the
various
elements
of
the
process
they
had
hoped
to
master
the
class
consciousness
that
springs
from
this
position
must
exhibit
the
same
internal
structure
as
that
of
the
bourgeoisie
but
when
the
logic
of
events
drives
the
same
dialectical
contradictions
to
the
surface
of
consciousness
the
consequences
for
the
proletariat
are
even
more
disastrous
than
for
the
bourgeoisie
for
despite
all
the
dialectical
contradictions
despite
all
its
objective
falseness
the
selfdeceiving
false
consciousness
that
we
find
in
the
bourgeoisie
is
at
least
in
accord
with
its
class
situation
it
cannot
save
the
bourgeoisie
from
the
constant
exacerbation
of
these
contradictions
and
so
from
destruction
but
it
can
enable
it
to
continue
the
struggle
and
even
engineer
victories
albeit
of
short
duration
but
in
the
case
of
the
proletariat
such
a
consciousness
not
only
has
to
overcome
these
internal
bourgeois
contradictions
but
it
also
conflicts
with
the
course
of
action
to
which
the
economic
situation
necessarily
commits
the
proletariat
regardless
of
its
own
thoughts
on
the
subject
the
proletariat
must
act
in
a
proletarian
manner
but
its
own
vulgar
marxist
theory
blocks
its
vision
of
the
right
course
to
adopt
the
dialectical
contradiction
between
necessary
proletarian
action
and
vulgar
marxist
bourgeois
theory
becomes
more
and
more
acute
as
the
decisive
battle
in
the
class
struggle
approaches
the
power
of
a
true
or
false
theory
to
accelerate
or
retard
progress
grows
in
proportion
the
realm
of
freedom
the
end
of
the
prehistory
of
mankind
means
precisely
that
the
power
of
the
objectified
reified
relations
between
men
begins
to
revert
to
man
the
closer
this
process
comes
to
it
1
s
goal
the
more
urgent
it
becomes
for
the
proletariat
to
understand
its
own
historical
mission
and
the
more
vigorously
and
directly
proletarian
class
consciousness
will
determine
each
of
its
actions
for
the
blind
power
of
the
forces
at
work
will
only
advance
automatically
to
their
goal
of
selfannihilation
as
long
as
that
goal
is
not
within
reach
when
the
moment
of
transition
to
the
realm
of
freedom
arrives
this
will
become
apparent
just
because
the
blind
forces
really
will
hurtle
blindly
towards
the
abyss
and
only
the
conscious
will
of
the
proletariat
will
be
able
to
save
mankind
from
the
impending
catastrophe
in
other
words
when
the
final
economic
crisis
of
capitalism
develops
the
fate
of
the
revolution
and
with
it
the
fate
of
mankind
will
depend
on
the
ideological
maturity
of
the
proletariat
i
e
on
its
class
consciousness
we
have
now
determined
the
unique
function
of
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
in
contrast
to
that
of
other
classes
the
proletariat
cannot
liberate
itself
as
a
class
without
simultaneously
abolishing
class
society
as
such
for
that
reason
its
consciousness
the
last
class
consciousness
in
the
history
of
mankind
must
both
lay
bare
the
nature
of
society
and
achieve
an
increasingly
inward
fusion
of
theory
and
practice
ideology
for
the
proletariat
is
no
banner
to
follow
into
battle
nor
is
it
a
cover
for
its
true
objectives
it
is
the
objective
and
the
weapon
itself
every
nonprincipled
or
unprincipled
use
of
tactics
on
the
part
of
the
proletariat
debases
historical
materialism
to
the
level
of
mere
ideology
and
forces
the
proletariat
to
use
bourgeois
or
petty
bourgeois
tactics
it
thereby
robs
it
of
its
greatest
strength
by
forcing
class
consciousness
into
the
secondary
or
inhibiting
role
of
a
bourgeois
consciousness
instead
of
the
active
role
of
a
proletarian
consciousness
the
relationship
between
class
consciousness
and
class
situation
is
really
very
simple
in
the
case
of
the
proletariat
but
the
obstacles
which
prevent
its
consciousness
being
realised
in
practice
are
correspondingly
greater
in
the
first
place
this
consciousness
is
divided
within
itself
it
is
true
that
society
as
such
is
highly
unified
and
that
it
evolves
in
a
unified
manner
but
in
a
world
where
the
reified
relations
of
capitalism
have
the
appearance
of
a
natural
environment
it
looks
as
if
there
is
not
a
unity
but
a
diversity
of
mutually
independent
objects
and
forces
the
most
striking
division
in
proletarian
class
consciousness
and
the
one
most
fraught
with
consequences
is
the
separation
of
the
economic
struggle
from
the
political
one
marx
repeatedly
exposed
37
the
fallacy
of
this
split
and
demonstrated
that
it
is
in
the
nature
of
every
economic
struggle
to
develop
into
a
political
one
and
vice
versa
nevertheless
it
has
not
proved
possible
to
eradicate
this
heresy
from
the
theory
of
the
proletariat
the
cause
of
this
aberration
is
to
be
found
in
the
dialectical
separation
of
immediate
objectives
and
ultimate
goal
and
hence
in
the
dialectical
division
within
the
proletarian
revolution
itself
classes
that
successfully
carried
out
revolutions
in
earlier
societies
had
their
task
made
easier
subjective
by
this
very
fact
of
the
discrepancy
between
their
own
class
consciousness
and
the
objective
economic
setup
i
e
by
their
very
unawareness
of
their
own
function
in
the
process
of
change
they
had
only
to
use
the
power
at
their
disposal
to
enforce
their
immediate
interests
while
the
social
import
of
their
actions
was
hidden
from
them
and
left
to
the
ruse
of
reason
of
the
course
of
events
but
as
the
proletariat
has
been
entrusted
by
history
with
the
task
of
transforming
social
consciously
its
class
consciousness
must
develop
a
dialectical
contradiction
between
its
immediate
interests
and
its
longterm
objectives
and
between
the
discrete
factors
and
the
whole
for
the
discrete
factor
the
concrete
situation
with
its
concrete
demands
is
by
its
very
nature
an
integral
part
of
the
existing
capitalist
society
it
is
governed
by
the
laws
of
that
society
and
is
subject
to
its
economic
structure
only
when
the
immediate
interests
are
integrated
into
a
total
view
and
related
to
the
final
goal
of
the
process
do
they
become
revolutionary
pointing
concretely
and
consciously
beyond
the
confines
of
capitalist
society
this
means
that
subjectively
i
e
for
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
the
dialectical
relationship
between
immediate
interests
and
objective
impact
on
the
whole
of
society
is
loc
in
the
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
itself
it
does
not
work
itself
out
as
a
purely
objective
process
quite
apart
from
all
imputed
consciousness
–
as
was
the
case
with
all
classes
hitherto
thus
the
revolutionary
victory
of
the
proletariat
does
not
imply
as
with
former
classes
the
immediate
realisation
of
the
socially
given
existence
of
the
class
but
as
the
young
marx
clearly
saw
and
defined
its
selfannihilation
the
communist
manifesto
formulates
this
distinction
in
this
way
“
all
the
preceding
classes
that
got
the
upper
hand
sought
to
fortify
their
already
acquired
status
by
subjecting
society
at
large
to
their
conditions
of
appropriation
the
proletarians
cannot
become
masters
of
the
productive
forces
of
society
except
by
abolishing
their
own
previous
mode
of
appropriation
and
thereby
every
other
previous
mode
of
appropriation
”
my
italics
this
inner
dialectic
makes
it
hard
for
the
proletariat
to
develop
its
class
consciousness
in
opposition
to
that
of
the
bourgeoisie
which
by
cultivating
the
crudest
and
most
abstract
kind
of
empiricism
was
able
to
make
do
with
a
superficial
view
of
the
world
whereas
even
when
the
development
of
the
proletariat
was
still
at
a
very
primitive
stage
it
discovered
that
one
of
the
elementary
rules
of
class
warfare
was
to
advance
beyond
what
was
immediately
given
marx
emphasises
this
as
early
as
his
observations
on
the
weavers
uprising
in
silesia
38
for
because
of
its
situation
this
contradiction
is
introduced
directly
into
the
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
whereas
the
bourgeoisie
from
its
situation
saw
the
contradictions
confronting
it
as
the
outer
limits
of
its
consciousness
conversely
this
contradiction
means
that
false
consciousness
is
something
very
different
for
the
proletariat
than
for
every
preceding
class
even
correct
statements
about
particular
situations
or
aspects
of
the
development
of
bourgeois
class
consciousness
reveal
when
related
to
the
whole
of
society
the
limits
of
that
consciousness
and
unmask
its
falseness
whereas
the
proletariat
always
aspires
towards
the
truth
even
in
its
false
consciousness
and
in
its
substantive
errors
it
is
sufficient
here
to
recall
the
social
criticism
of
the
utopians
or
the
proletarian
and
revolutionary
extension
of
ricardo
s
theory
concerning
the
latter
engels
places
great
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
it
is
“
formally
incorrect
economically
”
but
he
adds
at
once
“
what
is
false
from
a
formal
economic
point
of
view
can
be
true
in
the
perspective
of
world
history
behind
the
formal
economic
error
may
lie
concealed
a
very
true
economic
content
”
39
only
with
the
aid
of
this
distinction
can
there
be
any
resolution
of
the
contradiction
in
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
only
with
its
aid
can
that
contradiction
become
a
conscious
f
actor
in
history
for
the
objective
aspiration
towards
truth
which
is
immanent
even
in
the
false
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
does
not
at
all
imply
that
this
aspiration
can
come
to
light
without
the
active
intervention
of
the
proletariat
on
the
contrary
the
mere
aspiration
towards
truth
can
only
strip
off
the
veils
of
falseness
and
mature
into
historically
significant
and
socially
revolutionary
knowledge
by
the
potentiating
of
consciousness
by
conscious
action
and
conscious
selfcriticism
such
knowledge
would
of
course
be
unattainable
were
it
not
for
the
objective
aspiration
and
here
we
find
confirmation
of
marx
s
dictum
that
mankind
only
ever
sets
itself
tasks
which
it
can
accomplish
”
40
but
the
aspiration
only
yields
the
possibility
the
accomplishment
can
only
be
the
fruit
of
the
conscious
deeds
of
the
proletariat
the
dialectical
cleavage
in
the
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
is
a
product
of
the
same
structure
that
makes
the
historical
mission
of
the
proletariat
possible
by
pointing
forward
and
beyond
the
existing
social
order
in
the
case
of
the
other
classes
we
found
an
antagonism
between
the
class
s
selfinterest
and
that
of
society
between
individual
deed
and
social
consequences
this
antagonism
set
an
external
limit
to
consciousness
here
in
the
centre
of
proletarian
class
consciousness
we
discover
an
antagonism
between
momentary
interest
and
ultimate
goal
the
outward
victory
of
the
proletariat
can
only
be
achieved
if
this
antagonism
is
inwardly
overcome
as
we
stressed
in
the
motto
to
this
essay
the
existence
of
this
conflict
enables
us
to
perceive
that
class
consciousness
is
identical
with
neither
the
psychological
consciousness
of
individual
members
of
the
proletariat
nor
with
the
masspsychological
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
as
a
whole
but
it
is
on
the
contrary
the
sense
become
conscious
of
the
historical
role
of
the
class
this
sense
will
objectify
itself
in
particular
interests
of
the
moment
and
it
may
only
be
ignored
at
the
price
of
allowing
the
proletarian
class
struggle
to
slip
back
into
the
most
primitive
utopianism
every
momentary
interest
may
have
either
of
two
functions
either
it
will
be
a
step
towards
the
ultimate
goal
or
else
it
will
conceal
it
which
of
the
two
it
will
be
depends
entirely
upon
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
and
not
on
victory
or
defeat
in
isolated
skirmishes
marx
drew
attention
very
early
on
41
to
this
danger
which
is
particularly
acute
on
the
economic
tradeunion
front
“
at
the
same
time
the
working
class
ought
not
to
exaggerate
to
themselves
the
ultimate
consequence
s
of
these
struggles
they
ought
not
to
forget
that
they
are
fighting
with
effects
but
not
with
the
causes
of
those
effects
that
they
are
applying
palliatives
not
curing
the
malady
they
ought
therefore
not
to
be
exclusively
absorbed
in
these
unavoidable
guerilla
fights
instead
of
simultaneously
trying
to
cure
it
instead
of
using
their
organised
forces
as
a
lever
for
the
final
emancipation
of
the
working
class
that
is
to
say
the
ultimate
abolition
of
the
wages
system
we
see
here
the
source
of
every
kind
of
opportunism
which
begins
always
with
effects
and
not
causes
parts
and
not
the
whole
symptoms
and
not
the
thing
itself
it
does
not
regard
the
particular
interest
and
the
struggle
to
achieve
it
as
a
means
of
education
for
the
final
battle
whose
outcome
depends
on
closing
the
gap
between
the
psychological
consciousness
and
the
imputed
one
instead
it
regards
the
particular
as
a
valuable
achievement
in
itself
or
at
least
as
a
step
along
the
path
towards
the
ultimate
goal
in
a
word
opportunism
mistakes
the
actual
psychological
state
0
consciousness
of
proletarians
for
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
the
practical
damage
resulting
from
this
confusion
can
be
seen
in
the
great
loss
of
unity
and
cohesiveness
in
proletarian
praxis
when
compared
to
the
unity
of
the
objective
economic
tendencies
the
superior
strength
of
true
practical
class
consciousness
lies
in
the
ability
to
look
beyond
the
divisive
symptoms
of
the
economic
process
to
the
unity
of
the
total
social
system
underlying
it
in
the
age
of
capitalism
it
is
not
possible
for
the
total
system
to
become
directly
visible
in
external
phenomena
for
instance
the
economic
basis
of
a
world
crisis
is
undoubtedly
unified
and
its
coherence
can
be
understood
but
its
actual
appearance
in
time
and
space
will
take
the
form
of
a
disparate
succession
of
events
in
different
countries
at
different
times
and
even
in
different
branches
of
industry
in
a
number
of
countries
when
bourgeois
thought
“
transforms
the
different
limbs
of
society
into
so
many
separate
societies
”
42
it
certainly
commits
a
grave
theoretical
error
but
the
immediate
practical
consequences
are
nevertheless
in
harmony
with
the
interests
of
capitalism
the
bourgeoisie
is
unable
in
theory
to
understand
more
than
the
details
and
the
symptoms
of
economic
processes
a
failure
which
will
ultimately
prove
its
undoing
in
the
short
term
however
it
is
concerned
above
all
to
impose
its
mode
of
life
upon
the
daytoday
actions
of
the
proletariat
in
this
respect
and
in
this
respect
alone
its
superiority
in
organisation
is
clearly
visible
while
the
wholly
different
organisation
of
the
proletariat
its
capacity
for
being
organised
as
a
class
cannot
become
effective
the
further
the
economic
crisis
of
capitalism
advances
the
more
clearly
this
unity
in
the
economic
process
becomes
comprehensible
in
practice
it
was
there
of
course
in
socalled
periods
of
normality
too
and
was
therefore
visible
from
the
class
standpoint
of
the
proletariat
but
the
gap
between
appearance
and
ultimate
reality
was
too
great
for
that
unity
to
have
any
practical
consequences
for
proletarian
action
in
periods
of
crisis
the
position
is
quite
different
the
unity
of
the
economic
process
now
moves
within
reach
so
much
so
that
even
capitalist
theory
cannot
remain
wholly
untouched
by
it
though
it
can
never
fully
adjust
to
it
in
this
situation
the
fate
of
the
proletariat
and
hence
of
the
whole
future
of
humanity
hangs
on
whether
or
not
it
will
take
the
step
that
has
now
become
objectively
possible
for
even
if
the
particular
symptoms
of
crisis
appear
separately
according
to
country
branch
of
industry
in
the
form
of
economic
or
political
crisis
etc
and
even
if
in
consequence
the
reflex
of
the
crisis
is
fragmented
in
the
immediate
psychological
consciousness
of
the
workers
it
is
still
possible
and
necessary
to
advance
beyond
this
consciousness
and
this
is
instinctively
felt
to
be
a
necessity
by
larger
and
larger
sections
of
the
proletariat
opportunism
had
–
as
it
seemed
–
merely
served
to
inhibit
the
objective
tendency
until
the
crisis
became
acute
now
however
it
adopts
a
course
directly
opposed
to
it
its
aim
now
is
to
scotch
the
development
of
proletarian
class
consciousness
in
its
progress
from
that
which
is
merely
given
to
that
which
conforms
to
the
objective
total
process
even
more
it
hopes
to
reduce
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
to
the
level
of
the
psychologically
given
and
thus
to
divert
into
the
opposite
direction
what
had
hitherto
been
the
purely
instinctive
tendency
as
long
as
the
unification
of
proletarian
class
consciousness
was
not
a
practical
possibility
this
theory
could
–
with
some
charity
–
be
regarded
as
a
mere
error
but
in
this
situation
it
takes
on
the
character
of
a
conscious
deception
regardless
of
whether
its
advocates
are
psychologically
conscious
of
this
or
not
in
contrast
with
the
right
instincts
of
the
proletariat
it
plays
the
same
role
as
that
played
hitherto
by
capitalist
theory
it
denounces
the
correct
view
of
the
overall
economic
situation
and
the
correct
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
together
with
its
organised
form
the
communist
party
as
something
unreal
and
inimical
to
the
true
interests
of
the
workers
i
e
their
immediate
national
or
professional
interests
and
as
something
alien
to
their
genuine
class
consciousness
i
e
that
which
is
psychologically
given
to
say
that
class
consciousness
has
no
psychological
reality
does
not
imply
that
it
is
a
mere
fiction
its
reality
is
vouched
for
by
its
ability
to
explain
the
infinitely
painful
path
of
the
proletarian
revolution
with
its
many
reverses
its
constant
return
to
its
startingpoint
and
the
incessant
selfcriticism
of
which
marx
speaks
in
the
celebrated
passage
in
the
eighteenth
brumaire
only
the
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
can
point
to
the
way
that
leads
out
of
the
impasse
of
capitalism
as
long
as
this
consciousness
is
lacking
the
crisis
remains
permanent
it
goes
back
to
its
startingpoint
repeats
the
cycle
until
after
infinite
sufferings
and
terrible
detours
the
school
of
history
completes
the
education
of
the
proletariat
and
confers
upon
it
the
leadership
of
mankind
but
the
proletariat
is
not
given
any
choice
as
marx
says
it
must
become
a
class
not
only
“
as
against
capital
”
but
also
“
for
itself
”
43
that
is
to
say
the
class
struggle
must
be
raised
from
the
level
of
economic
necessity
to
the
level
of
conscious
aim
and
effective
class
consciousness
the
pacifists
and
humanitarians
of
the
class
struggle
whose
efforts
tend
whether
they
will
or
no
to
retard
this
lengthy
painful
and
crisisridden
process
would
be
horrified
if
they
could
but
see
what
sufferings
they
inflict
on
the
proletariat
by
extending
this
course
of
education
but
the
proletariat
cannot
abdicate
its
mission
the
only
question
at
issue
is
how
much
it
has
to
suffer
before
it
achieves
ideological
maturity
before
it
acquires
a
true
understanding
of
its
class
situation
and
a
true
class
consciousness
of
course
this
uncertainty
and
lack
of
clarity
are
themselves
the
symptoms
of
the
crisis
in
bourgeois
society
as
the
product
of
capitalism
the
proletariat
must
necessarily
be
subject
to
the
modes
of
existence
of
its
creator
this
mode
of
existence
is
inhumanity
and
reification
no
doubt
the
very
existence
of
the
proletariat
implies
criticism
and
the
negation
of
this
form
of
life
but
until
the
objective
crisis
of
capitalism
has
matured
and
until
the
proletariat
has
achieved
true
class
consciousness
and
the
ability
to
understand
the
crisis
fully
it
cannot
go
beyond
the
criticism
of
reification
and
so
it
is
only
negatively
superior
to
its
antagonist
indeed
if
it
can
do
no
more
than
negate
some
aspects
of
capitalism
if
it
cannot
at
least
aspire
to
a
critique
of
the
whole
then
it
will
not
even
achieve
a
negative
superiority
this
applies
to
the
pettybourgeois
attitudes
of
most
trade
unionists
such
criticism
from
the
standpoint
of
capitalism
can
be
seen
most
strikingly
in
the
separation
of
the
various
theatres
of
war
the
bare
fact
of
separation
itself
indicates
that
the
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
is
still
fettered
by
reification
and
if
the
proletariat
finds
the
economic
inhumanity
to
which
it
is
subjected
easier
to
understand
than
the
political
and
the
political
easier
than
the
cultural
then
all
these
separations
point
to
the
extent
of
the
still
unconquered
power
of
capitalist
forms
of
life
in
the
proletariat
itself
the
reified
consciousness
must
also
remain
hopelessly
trapped
in
the
two
extremes
of
crude
empiricism
and
abstract
utopianism
in
the
one
case
consciousness
becomes
either
a
completely
passive
observer
moving
in
obedience
to
laws
which
it
can
never
control
in
the
other
it
regards
itself
as
a
power
which
is
able
of
its
own
–
subjective
–
volition
to
master
the
essentially
meaningless
motion
of
objects
we
have
already
identified
the
crude
empiricism
of
the
opportunists
in
its
relation
to
proletarian
class
consciousness
we
must
now
go
on
to
see
utopianism
as
characteristic
of
the
internal
divisions
within
class
consciousness
the
separation
of
empiricism
from
utopianism
undertaken
here
for
purely
methodological
reasons
should
not
be
taken
as
an
admission
that
the
two
cannot
occur
together
in
particular
trends
and
even
individuals
on
the
contrary
they
are
frequently
found
together
and
are
joined
by
an
internal
bond
the
philosophical
efforts
of
the
young
marx
were
largely
directed
towards
the
refutation
of
the
various
false
theories
of
consciousness
including
both
the
idealism
of
the
hegelian
school
and
the
materialism
of
feuerbach
and
towards
the
discovery
of
a
correct
view
of
the
role
of
consciousness
in
history
as
early
as
the
correspondence
of
1843
with
ruge
he
conceives
of
consciousness
as
immanent
in
history
consciousness
does
not
lie
outside
the
real
process
of
history
it
does
not
have
to
be
introduced
into
the
world
by
philosophers
therefore
to
gaze
down
arrogantly
upon
the
petty
struggles
of
the
world
and
to
despise
them
is
indefensible
“
we
only
show
it
the
world
what
its
struggles
are
about
and
consciousness
is
a
thing
that
it
must
needs
acquire
whether
it
will
or
not
”
what
is
needed
then
is
only
“
to
explain
its
own
actions
to
it
”
44
the
great
polemic
against
hegel
in
the
holy
family
concentrates
mainly
on
this
point
45
hegel
s
inadequacy
is
that
he
only
seems
to
allow
the
absolute
spirit
to
make
history
the
resulting
otherworldliness
of
consciousness
visàvis
the
real
events
of
history
becomes
in
the
hands
of
hegel
s
disciples
an
arrogant
–
and
reactionary
confrontation
of
spirit
and
mass
marx
mercilessly
exposes
the
flaws
and
absurdities
and
the
reversions
to
a
prehegelian
stage
implicit
in
this
approach
complementing
this
is
his
–
aphoristic
–
critique
of
feuerbach
the
materialists
had
elaborated
a
view
of
consciousness
as
of
something
appertaining
to
this
world
marx
sees
it
as
merely
one
stage
in
the
process
the
stage
of
bourgeois
society
he
opposes
to
it
the
notion
of
consciousness
as
practical
critical
activity
with
the
task
of
changing
the
world
this
provides
us
with
the
philosophical
foundation
we
need
to
settle
accounts
with
the
utopians
for
their
thought
contains
this
very
duality
of
social
process
and
the
consciousness
of
it
consciousness
approaches
society
from
another
world
and
leads
it
from
the
false
path
it
has
followed
back
to
the
right
one
the
utopians
are
prevented
by
the
undeveloped
nature
of
the
proletarian
movement
from
seeing
the
true
bearer
of
historical
movement
in
history
itself
in
the
way
the
proletariat
organises
itself
as
a
class
and
hence
in
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
they
are
not
yet
able
to
“
take
note
of
what
is
happening
before
their
very
eyes
and
to
become
its
mouthpiece
”
46
it
would
be
foolish
to
believe
that
this
criticism
and
the
recognition
that
a
postutopian
attitude
to
history
has
become
objectively
possible
means
that
utopianism
can
be
dismissed
as
a
factor
in
the
proletariat
s
struggle
for
freedom
this
is
true
only
for
those
stages
of
class
consciousness
that
have
really
achieved
the
unity
of
theory
and
practice
described
by
marx
the
real
and
practical
intervention
of
class
consciousness
in
the
course
of
history
and
hence
the
practical
understanding
of
reification
and
this
did
not
all
happen
at
a
single
stroke
and
in
a
coherent
manner
for
there
are
not
merely
national
and
social
stages
involved
but
there
are
also
gradations
within
the
class
consciousness
of
workers
in
the
same
strata
the
separation
of
economics
from
politics
is
the
most
revealing
and
also
the
most
important
instance
of
this
it
appears
that
some
sections
of
the
proletariat
have
quite
the
right
instincts
as
far
as
the
economic
struggle
goes
and
can
even
raise
them
to
the
level
of
class
consciousness
at
the
same
time
however
when
it
comes
to
political
questions
they
manage
to
persist
in
a
completely
utopian
point
of
view
it
does
not
need
to
be
emphasised
that
there
is
no
question
here
of
a
mechanical
duality
the
utopian
view
of
the
function
of
politics
must
impinge
dialectically
on
their
views
about
economics
and
in
particular
on
their
notions
about
the
economy
as
a
totality
as
for
example
in
the
syndicalist
theory
of
revolution
in
the
absence
of
a
real
understanding
of
the
interaction
between
politics
and
economics
a
war
against
the
whole
economic
system
to
say
nothing
of
its
reorganisation
is
quite
out
of
the
question
the
influence
enjoyed
even
today
by
such
completely
utopian
theories
as
those
of
ballod
or
of
guildsocialism
shows
the
extent
to
which
utopian
thought
is
still
prevalent
even
at
a
level
where
the
direct
lifeinterests
of
the
proletariat
are
most
nearly
concerned
and
where
the
present
crisis
makes
it
possible
to
read
off
from
history
the
correct
course
of
action
to
be
followed
this
syndrome
must
make
its
appearance
even
more
blatantly
where
it
is
not
yet
possible
to
see
society
is
a
whole
this
can
be
seen
at
its
clearest
in
purely
ideological
questions
in
questions
of
culture
these
questions
occupy
an
almost
wholly
isolated
position
in
the
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
the
organic
bonds
connecting
these
issues
with
the
immediate
lifeinterests
of
the
proletariat
as
well
as
with
society
as
a
whole
have
not
even
begun
to
penetrate
its
consciousness
the
achievement
in
this
area
hardly
ever
goes
beyond
the
selfcriticism
of
capitalism
–
carried
out
here
by
the
proletariat
what
is
positive
here
in
theory
and
practice
is
almost
entirely
utopian
these
gradations
are
then
on
the
one
hand
objective
historical
necessities
nuances
in
the
objective
possibilities
of
consciousness
such
as
the
relative
cohesiveness
of
politics
and
economics
in
comparison
to
cultural
questions
on
the
other
hand
where
consciousness
already
exists
as
an
objective
possibility
they
indicate
degrees
of
distance
between
the
psychological
class
consciousness
and
the
adequate
understanding
of
the
total
situation
these
gradations
however
can
no
longer
be
referred
back
to
socioeconomic
causes
the
objective
theory
of
class
consciousness
is
the
theory
of
its
objective
possibility
the
stratification
of
the
problems
and
economic
interests
within
the
proletariat
is
unfortunately
almost
wholly
unexplored
but
research
would
undoubtedly
lead
to
discoveries
of
the
very
first
importance
but
however
useful
it
would
be
to
produce
a
typology
of
the
various
strata
we
would
still
be
confronted
at
every
turn
with
the
problem
of
whether
it
is
actually
possible
to
make
the
objective
possibility
of
class
consciousness
into
a
reality
hitherto
this
question
could
only
occur
to
extraordinary
individuals
consider
marx
s
completely
nonutopian
prescience
with
regard
to
the
problems
of
dictatorship
today
it
has
become
a
real
and
relevant
question
for
a
whole
class
the
question
of
the
inner
transformation
of
the
proletariat
of
its
development
to
the
stage
of
its
own
objective
historical
mission
it
is
an
ideological
crisis
which
must
be
solved
before
a
practical
solution
to
the
world
s
economic
crisis
can
be
found
in
view
of
the
great
distance
that
the
proletariat
has
to
travel
ideologically
it
would
be
disastrous
to
foster
any
illusions
but
it
would
be
no
less
disastrous
to
overlook
the
forces
at
work
within
the
proletariat
which
are
tending
towards
the
ideological
defeat
of
capitalism
every
proletarian
revolution
has
created
workers
councils
in
an
increasingly
radical
and
conscious
manner
when
this
weapon
increases
in
power
to
the
point
where
it
becomes
the
organ
of
state
this
is
a
sign
that
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
is
on
the
verge
of
overcoming
the
bourgeois
outlook
of
its
leaders
the
revolutionary
workers
council
not
to
be
confused
with
its
opportunist
caricatures
is
one
of
the
forms
which
the
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
has
striven
to
create
ever
since
its
inception
the
fact
that
it
exists
and
is
constantly
developing
shows
that
the
proletariat
already
stands
on
the
threshold
of
its
own
consciousness
and
hence
on
the
threshold
of
victory
the
workers
council
spells
the
political
and
economic
defeat
of
reification
in
the
period
following
the
dictatorship
it
will
eliminate
the
bourgeois
separation
of
the
legislature
administration
and
judiciary
during
the
struggle
for
control
its
mission
is
twofold
on
the
one
hand
it
must
overcome
the
fragmentation
of
the
proletariat
in
time
and
space
and
on
the
other
it
has
to
bring
economics
and
politics
together
into
the
true
synthesis
of
proletarian
praxis
in
this
way
it
will
help
to
reconcile
the
dialectical
conflict
between
immediate
interests
and
ultimate
goal
thus
we
must
never
overlook
the
distance
that
separates
the
consciousness
of
even
the
most
revolutionary
worker
from
the
authentic
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
but
even
this
situation
can
be
explained
on
the
basis
of
the
marxist
theory
of
class
struggle
and
class
consciousness
the
proletariat
only
perfects
itself
by
annihilating
and
transcending
itself
by
creating
the
classless
society
through
the
successful
conclusion
of
its
own
class
struggle
the
struggle
for
this
society
in
which
the
dictatorship
of
the
proletariat
is
merely
a
phase
is
not
just
a
battle
waged
against
an
external
enemy
the
bourgeoisie
it
is
equally
the
struggle
of
the
proletariat
against
itself
against
the
devastating
and
degrading
effects
of
the
capitalist
system
upon
its
class
consciousness
the
proletariat
will
only
have
won
the
real
victory
when
it
has
overcome
these
effects
within
itself
the
separation
of
the
areas
that
should
be
united
the
diverse
stages
of
consciousness
which
the
proletariat
has
reached
in
the
various
spheres
of
activity
are
a
precise
index
of
what
has
been
achieved
and
what
remains
to
be
done
the
proletariat
must
not
shy
away
from
selfcriticism
for
victory
can
only
be
gained
by
the
truth
and
selfcriticism
must
therefore
be
its
natural
element

unconsciousness
if

between
consciousness
and
unconsciousness
there
are
several
altered
levels
each
with
its
own
definition
altered
level
of
consciousness
altered
or
abnormal
levels
of
consciousness
are
states
in
which
you
either
have
decreased
cognitive
function
or
cannot
be
easily
aroused
most
medical
conditions
affect
the
brain
and
impair
consciousness
when
they
become
serious
or
lifethreatening
an
altered
loc
usually
signals
a
serious
medical
problem
are
you
at
risk
of
altered
level
of
consciousness
if
you
are
at
risk
for
altered
loc
be
sure
to
have
the
proper
medical
precautions
in
place
for
example
wear
a
medical
alert
bracelet
or
download
a

app
that
lists
your
diagnoses
medications

is
locked
you
may
also
want
to
designate
a
healthcare
proxy
to
speak
for
you
if
you
are
unable
often
an
altered
loc
can
deteriorate
rapidly
from
one
stage

an
altered
level
of
consciousness
is
any
measure
of
arousal
other
than
normal
level
of
consciousness
loc
is
a
measurement
of
a
person
s
arousability
and
responsiveness
to
stimuli
from
the
environment
1
a
mildly
depressed
level
of
consciousness
or
alertness
may
be
classed
as
lethargy
someone
in
this
state
can
be
aroused
with
little
difficulty
1
people
who
are
obtunded
have
a
more
depressed
level
of
consciousness
and
cannot
be
fully
aroused
12
those
who
are
not
able
to
be
aroused
from
a
sleeplike
state
are
said
to
be
stuporous
12
coma
is
the
inability
to
make
any
purposeful
response
12
scales
such
as
the
glasgow
coma
scale
have
been
designed
to
measure
the
level
of
consciousness
an
altered
level
of
consciousness
can
result
from
a
variety
of
factors
including
alterations
in
the
chemical
environment
of
the
brain
e
g
exposure
to
poisons
or
intoxicants
insufficient
oxygen
or
blood
flow
in
the
brain
and
excessive
pressure
within
the
skull
prolonged
unconsciousness
is
understood
to
be
a
sign
of
a
medical
emergency
3
a
deficit
in
the
level
of
consciousness
suggests
that
both
of
the
cerebral
hemispheres
or
the
reticular
activating
system
have
been
injured
4
a
decreased
level
of
consciousness
correlates
to
increased
morbidity
sickness
and
mortality
death
5
thus
it
is
a
valuable
measure
of
a
patient
s
medical
and
neurological
status
in
fact
some
sources
consider
level
of
consciousness
to
be
one
of
the

metaconscious
preternatural
people
who
possess
the
ability
to
monitor
and
control
their
own
cognitive
processes
in
addition
to
meeting
all
the
criteria
indicative
of
a
normal
level
of
consciousness
in
the
field
of
cognitive
neuroscience
metacognitive
monitoring
and
control
have
been
viewed
as
functions
of
the
prefrontal
cortex
which
receives
sensory
input
signals
from
divergent
cortical
regions
and
implements
control
through
feedback
loops
which
are
established
utilizing
the
underlying
mechanisms
of
neuroplasticity

the

another
means
of
measuring

people
are
assessed
to
determine
whether
they
are
alert
responsive
to
verbal

to
determine
responsiveness
to

responsiveness
to

is
determined
with
a
mild
painful
stimulus

as
a
pinch
moaning

is
considered
a
response

the
acdu
scale
like
avpu

easier
to

pathophysiology
edit
although
the
neural
science
behind
alertness
wakefulness
and
arousal
are
not
fully
known
the
reticular
formation
is
known
to
play
a
role
in
these
9
the
ascending
reticular
activating
system
is
a
postulated
group
of
neural
connections
that
receives
sensory
input
and
projects
to
the
cerebral
cortex
through
the
midbrain
and
thalamus
from
the
reticular
formation
9
since
this
system
is
thought
to
modulate
wakefulness
and
sleep
interference
with
it
such
as
injury
illness
or
metabolic
disturbances
could
alter
the
level
of
consciousness
9
normally
stupor
and
coma
are
produced
by
interference
with
the
brain
stem
such
as
can
be
caused
by
a
lesion
or
indirect
effects
such
as
brain
herniation
9
mass
lesions
in
the
brain
stem
normally
cause
coma
due
to
their
effects
on
the
reticular
formation
11
mass
lesions
that
occur
above
the
tentorium
cerebelli
normally
do
not
significantly
alter
the
level
of
consciousness
unless
they
are
very
large
or
affect
both
cerebral
hemispheres
9
diagnosis
edit
assessing
loc
involves
determining
an
individual
s
response
to
external
stimuli
12
speed
and
accuracy
of
responses
to
questions
and
reactions
to
stimuli
such
as
touch
and
pain
are
noted
12
reflexes
such
as
the
cough
and
gag
reflexes
are
also
means
of
judging
loc
12
once
the
level
of
consciousness
is
determined
clinicians
seek
clues
for
the
cause
of
any
alteration
9
usually
the
first
tests
in
the
er
are
pulse
oximetry
to
determine
if
there
is
hypoxia
serum
glucose
levels
to
rule
out
hypoglycemia

level
of
consciousness
can
be
lowered
when
the
brain
receives
insufficient
oxygen
as
occurs
in
hypoxia
insufficient

as
occurs
in

in
children
for
example
due

3
conditions
of
the
heart
and
conditions
of
the
lungs
can
alter
consciousness
metabolic
disorders
such
as
diabetes

and
uremia
can
alter
consciousness
12
hypo
or
hypernatremia
decreased
and
elevated
levels
of
sodium
respectively
as
well
as
dehydration
can
also
produce
an
altered
loc
13
a
ph
outside
of
the

the
brain
can
tolerate
will
also
alter
loc
9
exposure
to
drugs
e
g
alcohol
or
toxins
may
also
lower
loc3
as
may
a
core
temperature
that
is
too
high
or
too
low
hyperthermia
or
hypothermia
increases
in
intracranial
pressure
the
pressure
within
the
skull
can
also
cause
altered
loc
it
can
result
from
traumatic
brain
injury
such
as
concussion
12
ischemic
stroke
and
brain
bleeding
are
other
causes
of
altered
consciousness
12
infections
of
the
central
nervous
system
may
also
be
associated
with
decreased
loc
for
example
an
altered
loc
is
the
most
common
symptom
of
encephalitis
14
neoplasms
within
the
intracranial
cavity
can
also
affect
consciousness12
as
can
epilepsy
and
postseizure
states
9
a
decreased
loc
can
also
result
from
a
combination
of
factors
12
a
concussion
which
is
a
mild
traumatic
brain
injury
mtbi
may
result
in
decreased
loc
citation
needed
treatment
edit
treatment
depends
on
the
degree
of
decrease
in
consciousness
and
its
underlying
cause
initial
treatment
often
involves
the
administration
of
dextrose
if
the
blood
sugar
is
low
as
well
as
the
administration
of
oxygen
naloxone
and

when
documenting
your
patient
s
level
of
consciousness
you
ll
notice
you
have
a
lot
of
options
to
choose
from
your
patient
can
be
alert
confused
in
a
coma
and
anything
in
between
knowing
the
difference
between
each
level
of
consciousness
will
help
you
chart
accurately
and
communicate
your
patient
s
condition
with
precision
the
different
levels
of
consciousness
are
alert
awake
and
responsive
confused
note
that
confusion
can
occur
anywhere
along
this
spectrum
and
is
not
always
present
prior
to
the
patient
becoming
somnolent
lethargic
etc
it
is
possible
to
have
a
patient
who
is
somnolent
or
even
lethargic
and
still
oriented
somnolent
sleepy
lethargic
very
drowsy
falls
asleep
in
between

obtunded
difficult
to
arouse
stuporous
very
difficult
to

unresponsivecoma
unarousable
describing
your
patient
s
loc
correctly
is
especially
important
when
there
are
acute
changes
in
condition
for
example
i
had
a
patient
recently
who
was
stuporous
upon
arrival
to
the
icu
but
quickly
became
unresponsive
requiring
immediate
intervention
in
order
to
keep
the
patient
safe
had
i
not
known
how
to
describe
this
patient
s
level
of
consciousness
using
standardized
language
there
could
have
been
a
huge
miscommunication
between
me
and
the
md
so
let
s
go
through
a
quick
example
using
an
entirely
fictitious
patient
ready
in
report
you
learn
the
following
about
your
patient

with

2
and
wbc
wdl
at
the
time
of
your
initial
assessment
at
0800
you
note
that
the
patient
opens
her
eyes
spontaneously
and
responds
to
questions
though
not
all
her
answers
make
sense
she
will
follow
simple
onestep
commands
but
when
you
ask
her
to
do
more
than
one
thing
at
a
time
she
does
not
always
follow
through
you
ask
your
patient
where
she
is
right
now
and
she
answers
“
in
my
living
room
”
at
this
time
your
patient
is
alert
and
confused
at
0900
you
bring
in
your
patient
s
medications
she
wakes
easily
to
voice
but
yawns
a
few
times
and
states
she
just
wants
to
sleep
at
this
point
your
patient
is
somnolent
at
1000
 
you
go
in
to
help
your
patient
get
repositioned
when
you
notice
she
opens
eyes
only
to
voice
or
stimulation
not
spontaneously
she
follows
some
basic
commands
and
is
slow
to
respond
she
drifts
off
again
once
no
longer
stimulated
your
patient
is
now
lethargic
at
1200
your
patient
is
more
difficult
to
arouse
her
responses
are
delayed
and
minimal
she
does
not
appear
to
fully
wake
when
stimulated
and
she
immediately
goes
back
to
sleep
when
not
stimulated
when
she
does
answer
questions
she
mumbles
and
is
clearly
confused
at
this
time
she
is
obtunded
by
1300
your
patient
can
only
be
aroused
by
vigorous
and
repeated
stimulation
when
the
stimulation
stops
she
immediately
lapses
back
into
her
unresponsive
state
the
only
vocalizations
she
makes
are
moans
she
is
now
in
a
stupor
at
1400
your
patient
is
unarousable
to
any
stimulation
even
vigorous
and
painful
stimuli
at
this
point
she
is
unresponsive
or
comatose
of
course
you
ve
been
updating
the
md
on
your
patient
s
changes
in
loc
all
morning
and
you
have
both
ensured
that
the
appropriate
interventions
have
been
instituted
in
a
case
with
patient
with
renal
disease
you
will
often
see
them
have
decreasing
levels
of
consciousness
as
their
ph
drops
secondary
to
their
metabolic
acidosis
with
a
patient
like
this
you
might
anticipate
the
md
ordering
an
abg
at
some
pointdon
t
be
surprised
if
it
comes
back
acidotic
typically
what
happens
is
the
patient
will
receive
dialysis
and
as
things
start
to
come
back
into
balance
the
patient
becomes
more
alert
assuming
they
don
t
have
any
other
underlying
physiologic
derangements
such
as
sepsis
the
other
common
situation
this
occurs
in
is
copd
exacerbation
the
ph
will
decrease
as
the
co2
increases
as
the
co2
rises
the
patient
becomes
more
and
more
comatoseusually
we
can
pull
the
patient
out
of
it
with
bipap
but
in
extreme
cases
they
may
be
intubated
you
ll
see
this
over
and
over
and
over
againespecially
if
you
work
in
a
medical
icu
or
telemetry
unit
this
whole
topic
of
consciousness
is
so
incredibly
interesting

as
it
relates
to
anesthesia

consciousness
a
psychological
condition
defined
by
the
english
philosopher
john
locke
as
“
the
perception
of
what
passes
in
a
man
s
own
mind
”

“

man
”
early
views
in
the
early
19th
century
the
concept
was
variously
considered
some
philosophers
regarded
it
as
a
kind
of
substance
or
“
mental
stuff
”
quite
different
from
the
material
substance
of
the
physical
world
others
thought
of
it
as
an
attribute
characterized
by
sensation
and
voluntary
movement
which
separated
animals
and
men
from
lower
forms
of
life
and
also
described
the
difference
between
the
normal
waking
state
of
animals
and
men
and
their
condition
when
asleep
in
a
coma
or
under
anesthesia
the
latter
condition
was
described
as
unconsciousness
other
descriptions
included
an
analysis
of
consciousness
as
a
form
of
relationship
or
act
of
the
mind
toward
objects
in
nature
and
a
view
that
consciousness
was
a
continuous
field
or
stream
of
essentially
mental
“
sense
data
”
roughly
similar

nervous

disease
altered
consciousness
the
method
employed
by
most
early
writers
in
observing
consciousness
was
introspection
—
looking
within
one
s
own
mind
to
discover
the
laws
of
its
operation
the
limitations
of
the
method
became
apparent
when
it
was
found
that
because
of
differing
preconceptions
trained
observers
in
the
laboratory
often
could
not
agree
on
fundamental
observations
the
behaviourist
view
the
failure
of
introspection
to
reveal
consistent
laws
led
to
the
rejection
of
all
mental
states
as
proper
subjects
of
scientific
study
in
behaviourist
psychology
derived
primarily
from
work
of
the
american
psychologist
john
b
watson
in
the
early
1900s
the
concept
of
consciousness
was
irrelevant
to
the
objective
investigation
of
human
behaviour
and
was
doctrinally
ignored
in
research
neobehaviourists
however
adopted
a
more
liberal
posture
toward
mentalistic
states
such
as
consciousness
neurophysiological
mechanisms
that
consciousness
depends
on
the
function
of
the
brain
has
been
known
from
ancient
times
although
detailed
understanding
of
the
neural
mechanisms
of
consciousness
has
not
been
achieved
correlations
between
states
of
consciousness
and
functions
of
the
brain
are
possible
levels
of
consciousness
in
terms
of
levels
of
alertness
or
responsiveness
are
correlated
with
patterns
of
electrical
activity
of
the
brain
brain
waves
recorded
by
an
electroencephalograph
during
wideawake
consciousness
the
pattern
of
brain
waves
consists
of
rapid
irregular
waves
of
low
amplitude
or
voltage
in
contrast
during
sleep
when
consciousness
can
be
said
to
be
minimal
the
brain
waves
are
much
slower
and
of
greater
amplitude
often
coming
in
periodic
bursts
of
slow
waxing
and
waning
amplitude
both
behavioral
levels
of
consciousness
and
the
correlated
patterns
of
electrical
activity
are
related
to
the
function
of
a
part
of
the
brainstem
called
the
reticular
formation

stimulation

the
ascending
reticular

it
was
once
supposed
that
the
neurophysiological
mechanisms
subserving
consciousness
and
the
higher
mental
processes
must
reside
in
the
cortex
it
is
more
likely
however
that
the
cortex
serves
the
more
specialized
functions
of
integrating
patterns
of
sensory
experience
and
organizing
motor
patterns
and
that
the
ascending
reticular
system
represents
the
neural
structures
most
critically
related
to
consciousness
the
brainstem
reticular
formation
should
not
however
be
called
the
seat
of

it
represents

integrative

no

everything

handled
better
thus
a
feeling
of
guilt
is
unavoidable
for
any
sentient
being
but
for
some
it
can
prove
to
be
extra
burdensome
in

a
guilty
conscience
an
introduction
a
guilty
conscience
must
be
the
most
misused
of
our
basic
emotions
it
is
actually
a
feeling
that
can
help
guide
us
back
to
the
right
path
when
we
have
actually
done
something
wrong
but
in
our
time
it
is
largely
abused
as
a
tool
for
psychological
warfare
on
ourselves
when
we
speak
of
a
guilty
conscience
we
must
therefore
immediately
separate
between
healthy
and
unhealthy
feelings
of
guilt
we
can
get
a
healthy
feeling
of
guilt
simply
because
we
have
done
something
wrong
in
these
instances
the
feeling
of
guilt
is
meant
to
help
motivate
us
to
engage
in
reparative
actions
 
all
too
often
a
temporary
guilty
conscience
is
an
unhealthy
expression
of
selfpunishment
often
over
not
being
able
to
meet
impossible
inner
demands
and
expectations
 
imagination
is
the
only
limitation
for
which
parts
of
reality
one
can
abuse
to
keep
oneself
down
bad
conscience
for
having
eaten
not
to

eating
candy
or
something
else
unhealthy
not
have
trained
after
a

to
end
it
not
to
stay
in
the
relationship
with
your
boyfriend
ex
children
and
parents
not
least
if
they
are
old
it
can
happen
if
you
are
ill
away
from
work
or
have
infected
others
one
may
have
a
bad
conscience
for
saying
no
or
for
not
saying
no
it
can
also
occur
over
thoughts
and
feelings
one
has
in
cohabitation
it
can
occur
after
infidelity
or
for
lack
of
and
too
much
sex
drive
there
is
almost
no
way
and
can
be
a
great
challenge
in
everyday
life
trapped
in
the
maelstrom
of
the
spirit
of
the
times
how
can
it
have
become
so
common
to
go
around
feeling
like
you
are
never
enough
why
can
t
we
give
ourselves
permission
to
be
as
we
are
to
just
live
life
in
all
our
human
imperfection
why
can
we
sometimes
see
the
irrationality
of
our
selfaccusations
but
still
be
unable
to
shed
the
painful
emotions
you
may
have
come
across
various
advice
and
tips
online
already
“
tell
yourself
you
are
good
enough
”
“
lower
your
standards
”
or
similar
expressions
are
often
employed
these
are
completely
right
and
in
some
cases
reminders
such
as
these
can
be
of
help
 
 
but
sometimes
you
may
not
be
aware
that
you
are
driving
yourself
far
too
hard
things
may
have
always
been
this
way
and
you
don
t
even
think
about
it
fish
don
t
believe
in
water
in
situations
like
these
awareness
and
active
work
with
your
inner
dialogue
can
be
enough
to
create
more
space
within
yourself
this
can
be
especially
true
for
those
who
have
a
somewhat
healthy
sense
of
selfesteem
at
their
foundation
but
find
themselves
being
drawn
into
the
“
hamsterwheel
”
stuck
in
time
constraints
and
the
eternal
demands
of
modern
life
 
chronic
guilt
for
no
reason
in
many
cases
we
find
that
the
problem
goes
deeper
a
chronic
guilty
conscience
often
for
no
reason
is
commonly
linked
with
a
vulnerability
in
an
individual
s
selfesteem
 
rationally
you
can
understand
that
you
are
too
hard
on
yourself
but
it
feels
like
you
just
aren
t
good
enough
and
should
step
it
up
anyway
 
when
things
feel
like
this
there
is
an
emotional
block
in
place
somewhere
often
unconsciously
in
situations
such
as
these
therapy
can
be
helpful
in
getting
to
the
bottom
of
what
the
driving
force
behind
the
difficulties
is
and
attempt
to
weaken
the
inner
mechanisms
of
selfsabotage
preferably
pulled
up
by
the
root
psychologists
as
early
as
freud
were
preoccupied
with
the
central
role
an
indeterminate
feeling
of
guilt
can
play
once
such
a
feeling
has
first
entered
the
psyche
it
can
become
a
driving
force
for
a
variety
of
symptoms
including
anxiety
and
depression
the
mind
can
become
preoccupied
with
seeking
out
confirmations
in
everyday
situations
of
such
basic
assumptions
thus
chronic
feelings
of
guilt
in
everyday
life
can
begin
not
only
in
the
maelstrom
of
the
times
but
also
in
disturbed
internalized
relational
experiences
from
childhood
this
does
not
necessarily
have
to
mean
great
traumas
often
the
driving
force
is
a
more
subtle
emotional
tension
the
child
who
grows
up
with
suffering
around
them
develops
basic
feelings
of
guilt
for
their
own
inability
to
help
the
child
who
does
not
have
their
negative
feelings
towards
others
acknowledged
will
still
feel
cruel
and
guilty
and
continue
to
direct
such
feelings
inward
other
times
the
induction
of
guilt
can
occur
via
various
forms
of
conditional
love
such
as
high
expectations
and
demands
sometimes
difficulties
with
guilt
can
be
rooted
in
growing
up
with
more
or
less
direct
accusations
criticism
and
disapproval
among
other
things
one
is
often
unaware
that
such
basic
conditions
can
become
the
driving
force
for
chronic
guilt
and
simply
becoming
aware
of
this
can
help
other
times
one
is
aware
but
driven
by
chronic
guilt
just
the
same
in
situations
such
as
these
emotionfocused
therapy
where
you
work
through
layers
of
anxiety
and
guiltcontaining
emotions
especially
repressed
anger
can
be
an
effective
means
of
breaking
the
pattern
in
our
experience
a
lot
of
anxiety
and
guilt
are
connected
to
contradictory
emotions
related
to
figures
central
in
one
s
upbringing
in
some
cases
adaptation
to
one
s
environment
goes
so
far
as
to
become
purely
selfdestructive
simply
saying
no
or
having
an
opinion
want
thought
or
feeling
that
conflicts
with
the
needs
of
others
can
create
a
feeling
of
guilt
then
therapy
with
a
psychologist
can
often
be
necessary
if
you
wish
to
give
therapy
for
a
guilty
conscience
a
try

a
psychologist
and
schedule
an
appointment
keep
in
mind
that
we
also
offer
video
therapy
for
people
across
norway
in
our
experience
it
works
just
as
well
as
inperson
therapy
for
most
people
therapy
for
a
guilty
conscience
with
trained
psychologists
in
oslo
if
you
at
any
time
want
to
give
therapy
a
go
we
will
begin
by
examining
your
problems
as
you
experience
them
here
and
now
and
work
with
concrete
examples
from
your
everyday
life
in
which
guilt
or
other
symptoms
are
intensified
these
concrete
examples
often
carry
within
them
a
larger
narrative
we
will
actively
work
to
understand
the
specific
driving
mechanisms
behind
your
symptoms
not
least
of
all
the
unconscious
ones
often
through
this
sort
of
work
relevant
links
to
the
past
can
come
up
and
when
this
happens
we
work
closely
with
these
as
well
we
endeavor
to
not
just
“
talk
about
it
”
or
“
dwell
on
the
past
”
but
to
work
actively
to
help
you
form
a
healing
relationship
where
you
can
be
yourself
and
you
can
react
as
an
entire
organism
to
what
you
have
experienced
thus
you
can
resolve
eventual
remnants
from
your
past
that
have
gotten
“
stuck
”
become
aware
of
your
patterns
and
achieve
lasting
change
going
forward
this
is
how
we
endeavor
to
combine
an
indepth
psychological
perspective
with
an
active
work
method
we
try
not
to
dig
up
the
past
just
for
the
sake
of
it
while
not
just
superficially
skimming
the
surface
the
degree
to
which
your
selfliberation
process
is
successful
is
greatly
dependent
on
the
cooperation
we
manage
to
establish
gaining
a
common
understanding
for
the
mechanisms
that
have
led
to
your
difficulties
and
finding
a
helpful
way
to
cooperate
are
our
natural
goals
at
the
start
of
therapy
 
you
will
quickly
discover
if
therapy
is
something
for
you
keep
in
mind
that
we
also
offer
video
therapy
right
in
your
own
home

yours

you
give

you
have
parents
who
constantly
“
gave
”
you
a
guilty
conscience
either
directly
or
subtly
through
accusations
or
hints
about
their
own
pain
someone
around
you
that
constantly
plays
the
role
of
“
victim
”

maybe
a
partner

has
started
to
pick
on
you

you
daily

started

believe

it
actually
is
about
you

the
word
consciousness
is
used
in
a
variety
of
ways
that
need
to
be
distinguished
sometimes
the
word
means
merely
any
human
mental
activity
at
all
as
when
one
talks
about
the
“
history
of
consciousness
”
and
sometimes
it
means
merely
being
awake
as
in
as
the
anesthetic
wore
off
the
animal
regained
consciousness
the
most
philosophically
troublesome
usage
concerns
phenomena
with
which
people
seem
to
be
“
directly
acquainted
”
—
as
the
british
philosopher
bertrand
russell
1872
–
1970
described
them
—
each
in
his
own
case
each
person
seems
to
have
direct
immediate
knowledge
of
his
own
conscious
sensations
and
of
the
contents
of
his
propositional
attitudes
—
what
he
consciously
thinks
believes
desires
hopes
fears
and
so
on
in
common
philosophical
parlance
a
person
is
said
to
have
“
incorrigible
”
or
uncorrectable
access
to
his
own
mental
states
for
many
people
the
existence
of
these
conscious
states
in
their
own
case
is
more
obvious
and
undeniable
than
anything
else
in
the
world
indeed
the
french
mathematician
and
philosopher
rené
descartes
1596
–
1650
regarded
his
immediate
conscious
thoughts
as
the
basis
of
all
of
the
rest
of
his
knowledge
views
that
emphasize
this
firstperson
immediacy
of
conscious
states
have
consequently
come
to
be
called
“
cartesian
”
it
turns
out
to
be
surprisingly
difficult
to
say
much
about
consciousness
that
is
not
highly
controversial
initial
efforts
in
the
19th
century
to
approach
psychology
with
the
rigour
of
other
experimental
sciences
led
researchers
to
engage
in
careful
introspection
of
their
own
mental
states
although
there
emerged
some
interesting
results
regarding
the
relation
of
certain
sensory
states
to
external
stimulation
—
for
example
laws
proposed
by
gustav
theodor
fechner
1801
–

that
relate
the
apparent
to
the
real
amplitude
of
a
sound
—
much
of
the
research
dissolved
into
vagaries
and
complexities
of
experience
that
varied
greatly
over
different
individuals
and
about
which
interesting
generalizations
were
not
forthcoming
it
is
worth
pausing
over
some
of
the
difficulties
of
introspection
and
the
consequent
pitfalls
of
thinking
of
conscious
processes
as
the
central
subject
matter
of
psychology
while
it
can
seem
natural
to
think
that
all
mental
phenomena
are
accessible
to
consciousness
close
attention
to
the
full
range
of
cases
suggests
otherwise
the
austrianborn
british
philosopher
ludwig
wittgenstein
1889
–
1951
was
particularly
adept
at
calling
attention
to
the
rich
and
subtle
variety
of
ordinary
mental
states
and
to
how
little
they
lend
themselves
to
the
model
of
an
introspectively
observed
object
in
a
typical
passage
from
his
later
writings
zettel

he
asked
is
it
hairsplitting
to
say
—
joy
enjoyment
delight
are
not
sensations
—
let
us
at
least
ask
ourselves
how
much
analogy
is
there
between
delight
and
what
we
call
“
sensation
”
“
i
feel
great
joy
”
—
where
—
that
sounds
like
nonsense
and
yet
one
does
say
“
i
feel
a
joyful
agitation
in
my
breast
”
—
but
why
is
joy
not
localized
is
it
because
it
is
distributed
over
the

say
“

or

”
in
a
related
vein
the
american
linguist
ray
jackendoff
proposed
that
one
is
never
directly
conscious
of
abstract
ideas
such
as
goodness
and
justice
—
they
are
not
items
in
the
stream
of
consciousness
at
best
one
is
aware
of
the
perceptual
qualities
one
might
associate
with
such
ideas
—
for
example
an
image
of
someone
acting
in
a
kindly
way
while
it
can
seem
that
there
is
something
right
in
such
suggestions
it
also
seems
to
be
immensely
difficult
to
determine
exactly
what
the
truth
might
be
on
the
basis
of
introspection
alone
in
the
late
20th
century
the
validity
and
reliability
of
introspection
were
subject
to
much
experimental
study
in
an
influential
review
of
the
literature
on
“
selfattribution
”
the
american
psychologists
richard
nisbett
and
timothy
wilson
discussed
a
wide
range
of
experiments
that
showed
that
people
are
often
demonstrably
mistaken
about
their
own
psychological
processes
for
example
in
problemsolving
tasks
people
are
often
sensitive
to
crucial
clues
of
which
they
are
quite
unaware
and
they
often
provide
patently
confabulated
accounts
of
the
problemsolving
methods
they
actually
employ
nisbett
and
wilson
speculated
that
in
many
cases
introspection
may
not
involve
privileged
access
to
one
s
own
mental
states
but
rather
the
imposition
upon
oneself
of
popular
theories
about
what
mental
states
a
person
in
one
s
situation
is
likely
to
have
this
possibility
should
be
considered
seriously
when
evaluating
many
of
the
traditional
claims
about
the
alleged
incorrigibility
of
people
s
access
to
their
own
minds
in
any
event
it
is
important
to
note
that
not
all
mental
phenomena
are
conscious
indeed
the
existence
of
unconscious
mental
states
has
been
recognized
in
the
west
since
the
time
of
the
ancient
greeks
obvious
examples
include
the
beliefs
longrange
plans
and
desires
that
a
person
is
not
consciously
thinking
about
at
a
particular
time
as
well
as
things
that
have
“
slipped
one
s
mind
”
though
they
must
in
some
way
still
be
there
since
one
can
be
reminded
of
them
plato
thought
that
the
kinds
of
a
priori
reasoning
typically
used
in
mathematics
and
geometry
involve
the
“
recollection
”
anamnesis
of
temporarily
forgotten
thoughts
from
a
previous
life
modern
followers
of
sigmund
freud
1856
–
1939
have
argued
that
a
great
many
ordinary
parapraxes
or
“
freudian
slips
”
are
the
result
of
deeply
repressed
unconscious
thoughts
and
desires
and
as
noted
above
many
experiments
reveal
myriad
ways
in
which
people
are
unaware
of
and
sometimes
demonstrably
mistaken
about
the
character
of
their
mental
processes
which
are
therefore
unconscious
at
least
at
the
time
they
occur
partly
out
of
frustration
with
introspectionism
psychologists
during
the
first
half
of
the
20th
century
tended
to
ignore
consciousness
entirely
and
instead
study
only
“
objective
behaviour
”
see
below
radical
behaviourism
in
the
last
decades
of
the
century
psychologists
began
to
turn
their
attention
once
again
to
consciousness
and
introspection
but
their
methods
differed
radically
from
those
of
early
introspectionists
in
ways
that
can
be
understood
against
the
background
of
other
issues
one
might
wonder
what
makes
an
unconscious
mental
process
“
mental
”
at
all
if
a
person
does
not
have
immediate
knowledge
of
it
why
is
it
not
merely
part
of
the
purely
physical
machinery
of
the
brain
why
bring
in
mentality
at
all
accessibility
to
consciousness
however
is
not
the
only
criterion
for
determining
whether
a
given
state
or
process
is
mental
one
alternative
criterion
is
that
mental
states
and
processes
enter
into
the
rationality
of
the
systems
of
which
they
are
a
part

introduction
responsiveness
is
often
thought
to
reflect
consciousness
and
for
a
long
time
unresponsiveness
was
considered
as
a
surrogate
of
unconsciousness
however
consciousness
and
responsiveness
are
two
different
concepts
¹
consciousness
is
considered
to
be
absent
during
sleep
or
anesthesia
but
in
certain
instances
subjective
experience
can
still
occur
e
g
dreaming23
similarly
consciousness
has
been
described
as
a
result
of
both
arousal
and
awareness
components
⁴
arousal
refers
to
the
overall
state
of
alertness
or
wakefulness
in
contrast
awareness
refers
to
the
subjective
experience
such
as
perceiving
a
blue
triangle
versus
a
red
circle
⁵
typically
at
the
clinical
level
arousal
is
indicated
by
the
opening
of
the
eyes
and
awareness
is
inferred
by
the
ability
to
follow
commands
various
levels
of
consciousness
exist
in
physiological
pharmacological
and
pathological
modifications
of
consciousness

may
also

a
few
studies
have
attempted
to
develop
an
objective

from

interestingly
the
spectral

which
quantifies
the
slope
of

spectral
density
of
restingstate
eeg
activity
is
another
measure
of
consciousness
that
is
highly
correlated
with
pci
and
allows
distinguishing
between
ketamine
and

are

ketamineinduced
anesthesia
can
be
distinguished
from
wakefulness
and
the
xenon
and
propofolinduced
anesthesia
conditions
are
partially
superimposed
in
the
spectral
exponent
consequently
these
are
difficult
to
distinguish
³
recently
a
decrease
in
highfrequency
oscillations
and
an
increase
in
lowfrequency
power
in
the
primary
sensory
motor
and
visual
cortices
were
observed
during
rem
sleep
when
compared
to
healthy
wakefulness
²
⁰
the
quantification
of
the
spectral
slope
between
30
and
50
hz
was
also
proposed
for
discriminating
rem
sleep
from
healthy
wakefulness
⁴
however
this
measure
did
not
differentiate
rem
from
nrem
sleep
thus
it
distinguishes
between
different
arousal
levels
but
not
awareness
levels
therefore
an
alternative
measure
to
simultaneously
disentangle
the
two
components
of
consciousness
requiring
fewer
trials
would
be
a
valuable
and
necessary
tool
the
classical
neurophysiological
approach
for
calculating
pci
power
spectral
density
and
spectral
exponent
relies
on
many
epochs
to
improve
the
reliability
of
statistical
estimates
of
these
indices
²
¹
however
these
methods
are
only
suitable
for
investigating
the
averaged
brain
states
and
they
can
only
clarify
general
neurophysiological
aspects
machine
learning
ml
allows
decoding
and
identifying
specific
brain
states
and
discriminating
them
from
unrelated
brain
signals
even
in
a
single
trial
in
realtime
²
²
this
can
potentially
transform
statistical
results
at
the
group
level
into
individual
predictions
⁹
a
deep
neural
network
which
is
a
popular
approach
in
ml
has
been
employed
to
classify
or
predict
brain
states
using
eeg
data
²
³
particularly
a
convolutional
neural
network
cnn
is
the
most
extensively
used
technique
in
deep
learning
and
has
proven
to
be
effective
in
the
classification
of
eeg
data
²
⁴
however
a
cnn
has
the
drawback
that
it
cannot
provide
information
on
why
it
made
a
particular
prediction
²
⁵
recently
layerwise
relevance
propagation
lrp
has
successfully
demonstrated
why
classifiers
such
as
cnns
have
made
a
specific
decision
²
⁶
specifically
the
relevance
score
resulting
from
the
lrp
indicates
the
contribution
of
each
input
variable
to
the
classification
or
prediction
decision
thus
a
high
score
in
a
particular
area
of
an
input
variable
implies
that
the
classifier
has
made
the
classification
or
prediction
using
this
feature
for
example
neurophysiological
data
suggest
that
the
left
motor
region
is
activated
during
righthand
motor
imagery
²
⁷
the
lrp
indicates
that
the
neural
network
classifies
eeg
data
as
righthand
motor
imagery
because
of
the
activity
of
the
left
motor
region
²
⁸
therefore
the
relevance
score
was
higher
in
the
left
motor
region
than
in
other
regions
thus
it
is
possible
to
interpret
the
neurophysiological
phenomena
underlying
the
decisions
of
cnns
using
lrp
in
this
work
we
develop
a
metric
called
the
explainable
consciousness
indicator
eci
to
simultaneously
quantify
the
two
components
of
consciousness
—
arousal
and
awareness
—
using
cnn
the
processed
timeseries
eeg
data
were
used
as
an
input
of
the
cnn
unlike
pci
which
relies
on
source
modeling
and
permutationbased
statistical
analysis
eci
used
eventrelated
potentials
at
the
sensor
level
for
spatiotemporal
dynamics
and
ml
approaches
for
a
generalized
model
we
used
the
leaveoneparticipantout
lopo
approach
for
transfer
learning
which
is
a
type
of
ml
that
transfers
information
to
a
new
participant
not
included
in
the
training
phase2427
the
proposed
indicator
is
a
2d
value
consisting
of
indicators
of
arousal
eciaro
and
awareness
eciawa
first
we
used
tms
–
eeg
data
collected
from
healthy
participants
during
nrem
sleep
with
no
subjective
experience
rem
sleep
with
subjective
experience
and
healthy
wakefulness
to
consider
each
component
of

i
e
lowhigh
arousal
and

awareness
with
the
aim
to
analyze
correlations
between
the
proposed
eci
and
the
three
states
namely
nrem
rem
and
wakefulness
next
we
measured
eci
using
tms
–
eeg
data
collected
under
general
anesthesia
with
ketamine
propofol
and
xenon
again
with
the
aim
to
measure
correlation
with
these
three
anesthetics
before
anesthesia
tms
–
eeg
data
were
also
recorded
during
healthy
wakefulness
upon
awakening
healthy
participants
reported
conscious
experience
during
ketamineinduced
anesthesia
and
no
conscious
experience
during
propofol
and
xenoninduced
anesthesia
finally
tms
–
eeg
data
were
collected
from
patients
with
disorders
of
consciousness
doc
which
includes
patients
diagnosed
as
uws
and
mcs
patients
we
hypothesized
that
our
proposed
eci
can
clearly
distinguish
between
the
two
components
of
consciousness
under
physiological
pharmacological
and
pathological
conditions
to
verify
the
proposed
indicator
we
next
compared
eciawa
with
pci
which
is
a
reliable
index
for
consciousness
then
we
applied
eci
to
additional
restingstate
eeg
data
acquired
in
the
anesthetized
participants
and
patients
with
doc
we
hypothesize
that
if
cnn
can
learn
characteristics
related
to
consciousness
it
could
calculate
eci
accurately
even
without
tms
in
the
proposed
framework
in
terms
of
clinical
applicability
it
is
important
to
use
the
classifier
from
the
previous
lopo
training
of
the
old
data
to
classify
the
new
data
without
additional
training
therefore
we
computed
eci
in
patients
with
doc
using
a
holdout
approach
²
⁹
where
training
data
and
evaluation
data
are
arbitrarily
divided
instead
of
crossvalidation
finally
we
investigated
why
the
classifier
generated
these
decisions
using
lrp
to
interpret
eci
³
⁰
we
show
that
proposed
eci
using
interpretable
deep
learning
distinguishes
arousal
and
awareness
between
normal
consciousness
sleep
anesthesia
and

to

we

when

using

signals
in
this

the

refers
to
the

were
acquired
precisely
three
domains
were

transfer
learning
the
target
domain
indicates
a
state
that
contains
a
single
session
for
calculating
eci
whereas
the
source
domain
indicates
those
sessions
that
are
included
in
the

phase
therefore
the
information
knowledge
trained
in
the
source
domain
is
applied
when
testing
the
target
domain
and
this
is
described
as
the

the

discussion
we
show
that
eci
clearly
distinguishes
between
low
and
high
states
of
arousal
and
awareness
in
tms
–
eeg
results
under
sleep
anesthesia
and
patients
with
doc
our
results
suggest
that
this
proposed
indicator
could
similarly
be
used
for
restingstate
eeg
data
without
tms
under
anesthesia
and
patients
with
doc
yielding
the
same
degree
of
accuracy
in
addition
a
high
correlation
with
pci
which
measures
the
integrated
eeg
response
of
the
thalamocortical
system
to
a
direct
perturbation
induced
by
tms
¹
⁶
proves
that
eciawa
is
reliable
using
tms
–
eeg
data
it
also
shows
that
the
two
measures
calculated
entirely
independently
using
different
methods
resulted
in
the
same
conclusion
which
is
a
sign
that
deep
learning
is
indeed
a
valid
and
reliable
approach
for
an
mlbased
indicator
eci
can
be
calculated
using
very
few
trials
furthermore
because
the
classifier
learned
specific
features
of
the
data
on
its
own
our
indicator
can
be
computed
regardless
of
whether
tms
is
applied
or
its
location
therefore
eci
is
a
significantly
practical
and
reliable
indicator
to
evaluate
levels
of
consciousness
under
various
conditions
our
analyses
using
lrp
highlighted
the
major
role
of
the
parietal
region
in
determining
consciousness
as
the
classifier
primarily
uses
brain
activity
in
this
lobe
for
predicting
low
and
high
states
of
arousal
and
awareness
tms
–
eeg
responses
under
sleep
exhibited
wellknown
phenomena
³
¹
in
wakefulness
tms
generates
a
series
of
lowamplitude
highfrequency
activities
related
to
cortical
flow
in
longrange
connections
³
²
a
similar
longlasting
response
is
evoked
during
rem
sleep
with
subjective
experience
³
³
during
nrem
sleep
with
no
subjective
experience
tms
triggers
larger
lowfrequency
activity
that
quickly
dissipates
³
²
which
is
the
hallmark
of
bistability
in
the
thalamocortical
system
cortical
effective
connectivity
is
also
broken
down
during
nrem
sleep3334
the
brain
response
to
tms
perturbation
was
already
used
to
distinguish
the
levels
of
awareness
irrespective
of
sensory
processing
and
motor
responses
under
physiological
pharmacological
and
pathological
conditions343536
therefore
this
tmsevoked
response
was
applied
to
our
endtoend
cnn
framework
similar
to
several
studies
using
ml
we
observed
higher
twoclass
low
or
high
classification
accuracy
using
cnn
when
compared
to
linear
discriminant
analysis
lda
and
support
vector
machine
svm
for
both
arousal
and
awareness
this
suggests
that
our
framework
is
especially
relevant
for
eeg
results
which
possess
several
nonlinear
features
the
classification
performance
of
spatiotemporal
information
was
higher
than
that
of
spatiospectral
information
using
our
framework
it
was
shown
that
temporal
information
discriminates
different
levels
of
consciousness
more
clearly
than
spectral
information
as
the
functional
connectivity
associated
with
consciousness
changes
in
both
space
and
time
³
⁷
however
this
does
not
imply
that
temporal
information
is
more
important
than
spectral
information
for
distinguishing
consciousness
temporal
information
has
more
distinct
characteristics
than
spectral
information
for
predicting
the
state
of
consciousness
in
the
proposed
framework
nevertheless
pci
also
used
spatiotemporal
dynamics
in
tmsevoked
responses
¹
⁶
which
is
significantly
important
for
distinguishing
consciousness
we
applied
transfer
learning
to
a
single
domain
as
well
as
multiple
domains
in
the
sleep
domain
classification
performance
was
high
when
trained
on
only
the
sleep
domain
or
together
with
the
anesthesia
domain
due
to
a
large
number
of
trials
in
the
sleep
domain
training
was
performed
satisfactorily
using
only
sleep
data
the
distance
of
the
averaged
tmsevoked
potentials
under
the
domains
of
anesthesia
and
sleep
was
significantly
close
which
indicated
that
the
two
domains
were
highly
similar
³
⁸
thus
a
close
distance
implies
that
the
two
domains
have
similar
patterns
and
the
classification
performance
indeed
increased
when
these
domains
were
trained
together
in
the
anesthesia
and
doc
domains
the
trials
of
a
single
domain
were
not
sufficient
thus
a
higher
classification
performance
was
achieved
when
trained
with
similar
domains
in
addition
brain
signals
change
over
time
even
when
recorded
with
the
same
participants
because
of
physiological
and
psychological
differences
over
time
²
⁷
therefore
participantindependent
learning
such
as
the
lopo
crossvalidation
is
considerably
difficult
as
opposed
to
participantdependent
learning
²
⁴
we
solved
these
problems
via
transfer
learning
utilizing
multiple
domains
and
participantindependent
eci
eci
by
averaging
interclass
probability
distinguished
whether
each
state
was
low
or
high
in
both
arousal
and
awareness
because
of
its
inherently
high
twoclass
performance
it
was
possible
to
calculate
the
discriminable
eci
using
a
few
trials
in
a
single
session
the
criteria
used
for
determining
eciaro
and
eciawa
were
different
especially
for
rem
sleep
ketamineinduced
anesthesia
and
uws
patients
although
the
dataset
was
the
same
these
states
were
trained
by
different
labels
depending
on
arousal
and
awareness
for
instance
rem
sleep
is
high
in
awareness
but
low
in
arousal
the
proposed
classifier
learns
models
for
these
different
criteria
by
training
itself
based
on
the
criteria
of
arousal
and
awareness
specifically
because
the
learning
ability
of
the
cnn
is
derived
from
the
automatic
extraction
of
complicated
representations
from
eeg
signals
³
⁹
it
can
properly
distinguish
between
both
states
even
if
the
same
state
has
different
labels
depending
on
the
criteria
we
further
used
data
from
mcs
patients
as
verification
samples
mcs
patients
were
correctly
predicted
since
data
from
uws
and
mcs
patients
were
included
during
training
and
the
classifier
is
independent
of
behavior
according
to
the
lrp
we
observed
higher
relevance
scores
in
the
parietal
regions
compared
to
other
regions
at
the
scalp
level
this
was
observed
for
all
data
including
tms
–
eeg
and
restingstate
eeg
results
the
brain
regions
that
led
to
decisionmaking
were
similar
in
arousal
and
awareness
however
this
does
not
imply
that
arousal
and
awareness
are
supported
by
the
same
underlying
neurophysiological
mechanisms
the
relevance
scores
simply
explain
the
patterns
of
cortical
eeg
activity
resulting
in
this
classification
in
sleep
and
healthy
wakefulness
when
arousal
and
awareness
were
high
they
were
highly
relevant
in
the
parietal
region
this
eeg
feature
which
distinguishes
high
and
low
states
in
arousal
and
awareness
can
be
interpreted
in
line
with
the
posterior
hot
zone
of
consciousness
⁴
⁰
local
changes
in
this
parietal
region
are
associated
with
the
occurrence
of
dreaming
and
unconscious
sleep4142
and
our
framework
may
learn
from
eeg
pivotal
features
recorded
in
this
area
the
importance
of
the
posterior
hot
zone
has
already
been
emphasized
using
the
withinstate
sleep
paradigm4344
similar
to
sleep
we
observed
high
relevance
scores
for
the
parietal
region
in
the
domains
of
both
anesthesia
and
patients
with
doc
this
implies
that
eeg
activity
in
this
region
had
a
decisive
effect
in
determining
the
high
and
low
states
of
arousal
and
awareness
the
increased
slowwave
activity
was
observed
under
propofol
and
xenoninduced
anesthesia
when
compared
to
healthy
wakefulness
before
drug
administration
³

in

just

³

moreover
under

tmsevoked

was
determined
to
be
similar
to
rem

which
features

during
a
low

³
⁶
previous
studies
have
shown
that
the
change
in
slow
waves
induced
by
propofol
is
primarily
observed
in
the
posterior

⁴

and
the
posterior
main

is
disrupted
during

alteration
of

⁷
in
uws
patients
tms
triggered
a
local
and
slow
response
similar
to
nrem
sleep
and
general
anesthesia
whereas
mcs
patients
showed
complex
tmsevoked
responses
³
³
similarly
differences
in
alpha
connectivity
between
the
uws
and
mcs
patients
are
apparent
within
the
posterior
hot
zone
⁴
⁶
that
is
when
determining
whether
arousal
and
awareness
are
low
or
high
our
classifiers
used
differences
and
changes
in
eeg
activity
over
the
parietal
region
to
make
decisions
particularly
similar
results
were
observed
in
patients
with
doc
using
several
tms
target
sites
and
in
sleep
and
anesthesia
domains
where
the
parietal
region
was
primarily
stimulated
this
suggests
that
our
findings
regarding
the
parietal
region
are
unrelated
to
the
tms
target
site
thus
our
trained
model
used
neurophysiological
features
to
classify
whether
arousal
and
awareness
are
low
or
high
this
indicates
an
appropriate
design
of
our
model
as
the
classification
decision
was
primarily
based
on
eeg
signals
over
the
parietal
region
which
is
suggested
to
be
a
hot
spot
of
consciousness
compared
to
the
frontal
region
⁴
³
the
difference
in
the
parietal
region
could
be
clearly
identified
through
correct
trials
during
sleep
and
healthy
wakefulness
it
is
meaningful
that
the
frontal
region
contributed
less
than
parietal
regions
in
the
context
of
the
controversy
regarding
the
spatial
localization
of
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness4045
considering
the
subcortical
influences
related
to
striatalthalamic
circuits
it
has
been
recently
observed
that
the
parietal
region
contributes
more
to
the
levels
of
consciousness
than
the
frontal
region
⁴
⁷
the
implication
of
the
parietal
cortex
in
consciousness
has
also
been
demonstrated
in
other
neuroimaging
modalities
such
as
functional
magnetic
resonance
imaging
⁴

and
magnetoencephalography

this
study
does
have
certain
limitations
first
our
sample
size
was
relatively
small
in
the
future
it
will
be
necessary
to
further
test
the
reliability
of
the
proposed
indicator
with
larger
cohorts
and
validate
it
at
the
clinical
level
before
implementing
it
in
a
clinical
setting
sleep
experiments
would
also
have
to
be
applied
to
more
participants
in
the
future
second
we
explored
the
possibility
of
calculating
eci
with
a
minimal
amount
of
data
up
to
a
single
trial
however
we
did
not
attempt
to
measure
eci
in
real
time
thus
in
the
future
eci
could
be
calculated
in
realtime
for
practical
application
third
eci
does
not
differentiate
between
physiological
pharmacological
and
pathological
conditions
but
distinguishes
between
high
and
low
states
of
arousal
and
awareness
eci
can
thus
distinguish
between
rem
sleep
or
ketamine
and
wakefulness
it
may
also
be
difficult
to
select
the
model
to
use
when
calculating
eci
since
the
domain
has
to
be
known
beforehand
nevertheless
if
a
single
domain
has
sufficient
trials
the
lopo
approach
would
be
the
most
accurate
another
limitation
might
be
related
to
the
possible
contamination
of
tmseeg
data
by
auditory
and
somatosensory
components
as
in
previous
studies173536
to
avoid
auditory
and
somatosensory
costimulation
participants
wore
earphones
with
noise
masking
and
a
thin
foam
between
the
scalp
and
the
tms
coil
that
was
used
although
it
is
difficult
to
systematically
rule
out
the
contribution
of
sensory
costimulation
in
every
measurement
the
application
of
effective
noisemasking
procedures
⁵
⁰
and
the
realtime
monitoring
of
data
quality
during
the
acquisition
⁵
¹
may
significantly
mitigate
this
issue
⁵
²
finally
eci
indicates
whether
arousal
and
awareness
are
low
or
high
and
cannot
be
considered
functional
it
therefore
should
be
developed
into
a
functional
index
in
conclusion
we
proposed
eci
as
a
neurophysiological
indicator
to
simultaneously
discriminate
the
levels
of
arousal
and
awareness
in
modified
states
of
consciousness
this
tool
allows
disentangling
the
levels
of
consciousness
with
a
single
measure
in
different
clinical
settings
such
as
monitoring
surgical
interventions
i
e
anesthesiainduced
states
and
diagnosing
patients
with
doc
this
indicator
was
validated
under
different
physiological
pharmacological
and
pathological
conditions
and
it
reliably
disentangled
low
levels
from
high
levels
of
both
arousal
and
awareness
besides
the
proposed
eci
is
considerably
accessible
and
practical
as
it
can
be
applied
to
restingstate
eeg
without
tms
and
requires
fewer
trials
therefore
the
proposed
indicator
can
be
a
reliable
discriminator
and
valuable
tool
as
an
objective
measure
of
consciousness
as
parietal
regions
appear
to
be
the
most
relevant
for
classification
an
eeg
configuration
around
that
area
could
be
sufficient
if
eci
is
used
in
clinical
practice
these
findings
could
be
useful
in
diagnosing
severely
braininjured
patients
and
monitoring
their
levels
of
consciousness
in
realtime
especially
in
clinical
settings
where
time
constraints
preclude

consequently
the

the

this

is
a
special
case
of
kfold

specifically
all

and
the

was
then
tested
using
the

phase
80

were
used
to
learn
the

and
the
remaining
20

this
process
was
repeated
for
each

further
internal

were
performed
to
choose
the

thus
the

the
lopo
crossvalidation
procedure
uses

efficiently
and
can
reduce

it
also
provides
unbiased

here
pi
is
the
probability
of
high
arousal
or
high
awareness
from
each
trial
i
among
the
probability
values
high
versus
low
for
the
two
classes
from
the
softmax
function
in
the
cnn
n
is
the
number
of
trials
in
a
single
session
j
the
averaged
interclass
probability
cj
from
arousal
is
the
value
of
the
xaxis
as
eciaro
and
the
averaged
interclass
probability
cj
from
awareness
becomes
the
value
of
the
yaxis
as
eciawa
consequently
eci
is
expressed
as
a
2d
indicator
representing
both
arousal
and
awareness
simultaneously
as
mentioned
earlier
we
used
the
lopo
crossvalidation
it
is
to
be
noted
that
only
data
from
one
participant
were
used
as
the
test
and
the
data
from
the
remaining
participants
were
used
for
training
finally
the
test
and
training
data
did
not

interpretation
using
lrp
we
used
lrp
based
on
a
backwardpropagation
mechanism
for
interpretability
of
the
deep
neural
networks
this

here
x
x1ldots
xd
indicates
an

vector
and
frmx
is
the
model
output
the
relevance
score
rp
is
the
decomposition
of
the
prediction
for
the
input
xp
this
score
is
calculated
through
the
backward
propagation
of
the
model
input
therefore
relevance
scores
describe
a
single
nonlinear
decision
for
the
output
corresponding
to
each
input
⁶
⁸
through
this
method
we
can
observe
not
only
the
interpretation
of
classification
decisions
but
also
what
features
the
model
has
learned
²
⁸
to
investigate
which
brain
regions
and
signals
caused
these
classification
results
we
compared
the
relevance
scores
from
the
lrp
by
dividing
them
into
the
following
three
regions
⁶

the

and
pz
regions
we
focused
on
the
frontal
temporal
and
parietal
regions
when
comparing
the
relevance
score
resulting
from
the
lrp
as
there
is
an
ongoing
debate
regarding
which
brain
area
i
e
the
front
versus
the
back
is
related
to
consciousness
⁴

we
also
included
the
temporal
region
as
activation
in
the
nrem

increases
in
this
region

additional

statistical
analysis
we
used
the
kruskal
–
wallis
test
nonparametric
oneway
analysis
of
variance
to
analyze
the
differences
in
the
classification
accuracy
moreover
twosided
multiple
ttests
were
used
for
posthoc
analysis
using
fisher
s
least
significant

method
for
multiple
comparisons
to
compare
the
classification
performance
of
the
three
classifiers
lda
svm
and
cnn
of

for
each

the
kruskal
–
wallis
test
was
also
performed
to
compare
the
classification
performance
using
transfer
learning
similarly
fisher
s
least
significant
differences
method
was
applied
after
the
twosided
multiple
ttests
to
investigate
the
discrimination
of
eci
in
each
state
of
consciousness
the
feedforward
network
was
trained
with
20
hidden
layers
using
the
lopo
approach
for
each
output
class
the
auc
sensitivity
and
specificity
were
calculated
using
roc
analysis
the
kruskal
–
wallis
test
was
employed
to
investigate
if
there
were
any
differences
in
relevance
scores
among
brain
regions
from
lrp
under
sleep
we
performed
twosided
multiple
ttests
using
fisher
s
least
significant
differences
method
for
multiple
comparisons
in
addition
the
kruskal
–
wallis
test
was
performed
to
explore
the
differences
in
relevance
scores
from
lrp
under
the
condition
of
anesthesia
and
for
severely
braininjured
patients
for
posthoc
analysis
twosided
multiple
ttests
were
performed
using
fisher
s
least

method
for
multiple

finally
we
used
pearson

to
investigate
the

the
politics
of

edit
consciousness
typically
refers
to
the
idea
of
a
being
who
is
selfaware
it
is
a
distinction
often
reserved
for
human
beings
this
remains
the
original
and
most
common
usage
of
the
term
1
for
marx
consciousness
describes
a
person

political
sense

self
that

consciousness
describes
a
person
s
awareness
of
politics
for
marx
an
authentic
consciousness
was
linked
to
understanding
one
s
true
position
in
history
while
hegel
placed
god
behind
the
workings
of
consciousness
in
people
marx
saw
the
political
economy
as
the
engine
of
mind
2
in
the
20th
century
many
social
movements
and
intellectuals
have
developed
this
use

edit
main

false
consciousness
in
marx
s
view
consciousness
was
always
political
for
it
was
always
the
outcome
of
politiceconomic
circumstances
what
one
thinks
of
life
power
and
self
for
marx
is
always
a
product
of
ideological
forces
for
marx
ideologies
appear
to
explain
and
justify
the
current
distribution
of
wealth
and
power
in
a
society
in
societies
with
unequal
allocations
of
wealth
and
power
ideologies
present
these
inequalities
as
acceptable
virtuous
inevitable
and
so
forth
ideologies
thus
tend
to
lead
people
to
accept
the
status
quo
the
subordinate
people
come
to
believe
in
their
subordination
the
peasants
to
accept
the
rule
of
the
aristocracy
the
factory
workers
to
accept
the
rule
of
the
owners
consumers
the
rule
of
corporations
this
belief
in
one
s
own
subordination
which
comes
about
through
ideology
is
for
marx
false
consciousness
that
is
conditions
of
inequality
create
ideologies
which
confuse
people
about
their
true
aspirations
loyalties
and
purposes
3
thus
for
example
the
working
class
has
often
been
for
marx
beguiled
by
nationalism
organized
religion
and
other
distractions
these
ideological
devices
help
to
keep
people
from
realizing
that
it
is
they
who
produce
wealth
they
who
deserve
the
fruits
of
the
land
all
who
can
prosper
instead
of
literally
thinking
for
themselves
they
think
the
thoughts
given
to
them
by
the
ruling
class

consciousness
and
the
politicaleconomy
edit
for
marx
consciousness
is
a
reflection
of
the
political
economy
a
person
s
thoughts
tend
to
be
shaped
by
his
or
her
political
and
economic
circumstances
he
famously
wrote
it
is
not
the
consciousness
of
men
that
determines
their
being
but
on
the
contrary
their
social
being
that
determines
their
consciousness
perhaps
marx
s
greatest
contribution
to
modern
thought
is
his
comprehensive
investigation
into
the
role
of
ideology
or
how
social
being
determines
consciousness
which
results
in
certain
for
the
most
part
unconscious
belief
and
value
systems
depending
on
the
particular
economic
infrastructure
pertaining
at
the
time
from
a
marxian
point
of
view
all
cultural
artifactsreligious
systems
philosophical
positions

valuesare
naturally
enough
products
of
consciousness
and
as
such
are

pressures

the

term
conscientization
is
a
translation
of
the
portuguese
term
conscientização
which
is
also
translated
as
consciousness
raising
and
critical
consciousness
the
term
was
popularized
by
brazilian
educator
activist
and
theorist
paulo
freire
in
his
1970
work
pedagogy
of
the
oppressed
freire
was
teaching
the
poor
and
illiterate
members
of
brazilian
society
to
read
at
a
time
when
literacy
was
a
requirement
for
suffrage
and
dictators
ruled
many
south

countries

term
originally
derives

overview

paulo
freire
defines
critical
consciousness
as
the
ability
to
intervene
in
reality
in
order
to
change
it
3
critical
consciousness
proceeds
through
the
identification
of
generative
themes
which
freire
identifies
as
iconic
representations
that
have
a
powerful
emotional
impact
in
the
daily
lives
of
learners
in
this
way
individual
consciousness
helps
end
the
culture
of
silence
in
which
the
socially
dispossessed
internalize
the
negative
images
of
themselves
created
and
propagated
by
the
oppressor
in
situations
of
extreme
poverty
liberating
learners
from
this
mimicry
of
the
powerful
and
from
the
fratricidal
violence
that
results
therefrom
is
a
major
goal
of
critical
consciousness
critical
consciousness
is
a
fundamental
aspect
of
freire
s
concept
of
popular
education
arlene
goldbard
an
author
on
the
subject
of
community
cultural
development
finds
the
concept
of
conscientization
to
be
a
foundation
of
community
cultural
development
from
the
glossary
of
goldbard
s
2006
book
new
creative
community
conscientization
is
an
ongoing
process
by
which
a
learner
moves
toward
critical
consciousness
this
process
is
the
heart
of
liberatory
education
it
differs
from
consciousness
raising
in
that
the
latter
may
involve
transmission
of
preselected
knowledge
conscientization
means
engaging
in
praxis
in
which
one
both
reflects
and
takes
action
on
their
social
reality
to
break
through
prevailing
mythologies
and
reach
new
levels
of
awareness
—
in
particular
awareness
of
oppression
being
an
object
of
others
will
rather
than
a
selfdetermining
subject
the
process
of
conscientization
involves
identifying
contradictions
in
experience
through
dialogue
and
becoming
part
of
the
process
of
changing
the
world
4
history
of
application
edit
the
ancient
greeks
first
identified
the
essence
of
critical
consciousness
when
philosophers
encouraged
their
students
to
develop
an
impulse
and
willingness
to
stand
back
from
humanity
and
nature
and
to
make
them
objects
of
thought
and
criticism
and
to
search
for
their
meaning
and
significance
5
in
his
books
pedagogy
of
the
oppressed6
and
education
for
critical
consciousness3
freire
explains
critical
consciousness
as
a
sociopolitical
educative
tool
that
engages
learners
in
questioning
the
nature
of
their
historical
and
social
situation
which
freire
addressed
as
reading
the
world
the
goal
of
critical
consciousness
according
to
freire
should
be
acting
as
subjects
in
the
creation
of
democratic
society
in
education
freire
implies
intergenerational
equity
between
students
and
teachers
in
which
both
learn
both
question
both
reflect
and
both
participate
in
meaningmaking
using
this
idea
and
describing
current
instructional
methods
as
homogenization
and
lockstep
standardization
alternative
approaches
are
proposed
such
as
the
sudbury
model
an
alternative
approach
in
which
children
by
enjoying
personal
freedom
thus
encouraged
to
exercise
personal
responsibility
for
their
actions
learn
at
their
own
pace
rather
than
following
a
previously
imposed
chronologicallybased
curriculum

picking
up
on
freire
s
definition
of
critical
consciousness
joe
l
kincheloe
has
expanded
the
definition
of
the
concept
in
his
work
on
postformalism
in
kincheloe
s
formulation
postformalism
connects
cognition
to
critical
theoretical
questions
of
power
and
social
justice
in
this
context
kincheloe
constructs
a
critical
theory
of
cognition
that
explores
questions
of
meaning
emancipation
visavis
ideological
inscription
and
a
particular
focus
on
the
sociopolitical
construction
of
the
self
with
these
concerns
in
mind
kincheloe
s
postformal
critical
consciousness
engages
questions
of
purpose
issues
of
human
dignity
freedom
authority
reconceptualized
notions
of
reason
intellectual
quality
and
social
responsibility
postformal
critical
consciousness
stimulates
a
conversation
between
critical
pedagogy
and
a
wide
range
of
social
cultural
political
economic
psychological
and
philosophical
concerns
kincheloe
employs
this
multilogical
conversation
to
shape
new
modes
of
selfawareness
more
effective
forms
of
social
political
and
pedagogical
action
and

internal
conflict
of
society
s
oppressed
not
to
be
confused
with
dual
consciousness
double
consciousness
is
the
dual
selfperception1
experienced
by
subordinated
or
colonized
groups
in
an
oppressive
society
the
term
and
the
idea
were
first
published
in
w
e
b
du
bois
s
autoethnographic
work
the
souls
of
black
folk
in
1903
in
which
he
described
the
african
american
experience
of
double
consciousness
including
his
own
2
originally
double
consciousness
was
specifically
the
psychological
challenge
african
americans
experienced
of
always
looking
at
one
s
self
through
the
eyes
of
a
racist
white
society
and
measuring
oneself
by
the
means
of
a
nation
that
looked
back
in
contempt
2
the
term
also
referred
to
du
bois
s
experiences
of
reconciling
his
african
heritage
with
an
upbringing
in
a
europeandominated
society
3
origin

title
page
of
a
1903
book
in
which
du
bois
essay
about
doubleconsciousness
was
republished
the
term
was
introduced
by
ralph
waldo
emerson
in
his
1842
essay
the
transcendentalist
du
bois
first
used
the
term
in
an
article
titled
strivings
of
the
negro
people
published
in
the
august
1897
issue
of
the
atlantic
monthly
4
it
was
later
republished
and
slightly
edited
under
the
title
of
our
spiritual
strivings
in
his
book
the
souls
of
black
folk
du
bois
describes
double
consciousness
as
follows
it
is
a
peculiar
sensation
this
doubleconsciousness
this
sense
of
always
looking
at
one
s
self
through
the
eyes
of
others
of
measuring
one
s
soul
by
the
tape
of
a
world
that
looks
on
in
amused
contempt
and
pity
one
ever
feels
his
twoness
—
an
american
a
negro
two
souls
two
thoughts
two
unreconciled
strivings
two
warring
ideals
in
one
dark
body
whose
dogged
strength
alone
keeps
it
from
being
torn
asunder
the
history
of
the
american
negro
is
the
history
of
this
strife
 
–
this
longing
to
attain
selfconscious
manhood
to
merge
his
double
self
into
a
better
and
truer
self
in
this
merging
he
wishes
neither
of
the
older
selves
to
be
lost
he
does
not
wish
to
africanize
america
for
america
has
too
much
to
teach
the
world
and
africa
he
wouldn
t
bleach
his
negro
blood
in
a
flood
of
white
americanism
for
he
knows
that
negro
blood
has
a
message
for
the
world
he
simply
wishes
to
make
it
possible
for
a
man
to
be
both
a
negro
and
an
american
without
being
cursed
and
spit
upon
by
his
fellows
without
having
the
doors
of
opportunity
closed
roughly
in
his
face
2
modern
conceptions
edit
the
concept
of
double
consciousness
has
been
expanded
on
by
many
different
scholars
in
the
20th
and
early
21st
centuries
commentators
have
examined
how
the
concept
can
be
expanded
to
other
aspects
of
the
african
american
experience
or
for
other
marginalized
groups
who
experience
a
similar
forms
of
oppression
5
gilroy
and
the
black
atlantic
edit
paul
gilroy
applied
theories
of
culture
and
race
to
the
study
and
construction
of
african
american
intellectual
history
he
is
known
especially
for
marking
a
turning
point
in
the
study
of
the
african
diasporas
6
his
book
the
black
atlantic
modernity
and
double
consciousness
1993
introduces
the
black
atlantic
as
a
source
for
cultural
construction
7
gilroy
pioneers
a
shift
in
contemporary
black
studies
by
arguing
for
a
rejection
of
the
notion
of
a
homogeneous
nationstate
based
nationality
in
favor
of
analyzing
the
atlantic
as
one
single
complex
unit
of
analysis
in
their
discussions
of
the
modern
world
and
use
it
to
produce
an
explicitly
transnational
and
intercultural
perspective
8
he
based
this
on
the
atlantic
slave
trade
and
marked
it
as
the
foundation
for
the
diaspora
he
recognized
the
significance
of
european
and
african
transnational
travel
as
a
foundation
for
double
consciousness
gilroy
used
du
bois
s
theory
of
double
consciousness
to
suggest
there
exists
an
internal
struggle
to
reconcile
being
both
european
and
black
which
was
his
main
focus
in
his
book
7
he
even
characterized
the
black
atlantic
by
the
influence
of
slave
trade
routes
on
black
identity
he
aimed
to
unify
black
culture
with
the
connection
to
the
homeland
as
well
as
the
cultural
exchanges
that
occurred
afterward
gilroy
s
work
became
popular
with
the
black
diaspora
in
europe
and
his
theories
became
the
foundation
for
several
black
power
movements
throughout
the
continent
9
gilroy
argues
that
occupying
the
space
between
these
two
dialectal
subjectivities
is
viewed
as
a
provocative
and
even
oppositional
act
of
political
insubordination
8
this
means
that
for
black
people
across
diaspora
thinking
of
the
duality
in
their
identity
as
one
is
almost
paradoxical
and
conceptualizing
and
actualizing
this
is
a
move
of
symbolic
resistance
in
modernity

frantz
fanon
edit
very
similarly
to
du
bois
frantz
fanon
touched
upon
the
term
of
double
consciousness
in
his
life
in
his
first
book
black
skin
white
masks
where
he
expressed
his
hopelessness
at
being
neither
white
nor
black
fanon
identifies
the
double
consciousness
that
african
americans
face
and
its
source
he
claimed
the
cultural
and
social
confusions
of
african
americans
were
caused
by
european
culture
10
he
gave
examples
of
things
that
he
has
encountered
that
demonstrate
the
double
consciousness
he
talks
about
people
who
preach
about
completely
conforming
to
being
white
and
says
that
they
are
wrong
he
also
says
that
the
people
who
believe
that
complete
rejection
of
whites
are
also
wrong
11
he
then
proceeds
to
talk
about
why
black
people
adopt
cultures
that
are
so
strange
to
him
he
talks
about
how
when
a
black
caribbean
leaves
for
europe
they
come
back
speaking
a
language
different
from
their
own
he
also
talks
about
how
africans
mostly
the
wealthiest
tend
to
have
insecurities
of
not
being
european
enough
because
they
are
african
this
manifests
in
buying
european
furniture
and
buying
european
clothes
11
in
addition
to
this
he
talks
about
the
way
white
men
talk
to
african
americans
and
how
it
contributes
to
this
problem
of
double
consciousness
he
says
that
when
a
white
man
talks
to
an
african
american
man
he
is
changing
his
language
to
a
way
in
which
a
stereotypical
black
man
would
talk
similarly
to
how
one
would
talk
to
a
child
with
different
language
sophistication
and
slang
he
says
that
this
angers
the
african
american
because
he
feels
as
though
he
has
been
categorized
and
imprisoned
into
a
box
from
which
he
cannot
escape
due
to
this
judgement
he
gives
an
example
of
a
film
where
this
stereotype
is
portrayed
and
then
talks
about
how
african
americans
need
to
be
educated
to
not
follow
the
stereotypes
displayed
by
white
culture

triple
consciousness
edit
in
the
21st
century
du
bois
s
theory
of
double
consciousness
has
been
revisited
to
develop
a
more
inclusive
concept
of
triple
consciousness
this
triple
consciousness
may
include
another
intersecting
identity
that
impacts
a
person
s
social
experiences
additional
identities
that
may
affect
the
already
present
double
consciousness
experience
might
include
ethnicity
gender
sexual
orientation
etc
for
example
juan
flores
identified
ethnicity
as
a
potential
aspect
that
influences
double
consciousness
by
speculating
afrolatinos
in
the
u
s
experienced
an
added
layer
of
discrimination
that
combined
skin
color
with
ethnicity
and
nationality
14
anna
julia
cooper
similarly
references
the
intersectionality
of
race
and
gender
within
her
work
a
voice
from
the
south
where
she
states
only
the
black
woman
can
say
when
and
where
i
enter
in
the
quiet
undisputed
dignity
of
my
womanhood
without
violence
and
without
suing
or
special
patronage
then
and
there
the
whole
race
enters
with
me
15
finally
jossianna
arroyo
explains
that
triple
consciousness
brings
spaces
culture
and
skin
to
recontextualize
blackness16
in
the
case
of
black
puerto
ricans
experiences
of
women
of
color
edit
just
like
any
other
thought
in
critical
race
analysis
double
consciousness
theory
cannot
be
divorced
from
gender
this
is
where
black
feminists
have
introduced
their
concept
of
the
triple
consciousness
17
black
women
not
only
have
to
see
themselves
through
the
lens
of
blackness
and
whiteness
but
also
through
the
lens
of
patriarchy
whenever
they
are
in
black
spaces
women
still
have
to
situate
themselves
in
the
context
of
patriarchy
whenever
they
are
in
fem
spaces
they
must
still
situate
themselves
in
the
context
of
their
blackness
deborah
gray
white
writes
african
american
women
are
confronted
with
an
impossible
task
if
she
is
rescued
from
the
myth
of
the
negro
the
myth
of
the
woman
traps
her
if
she
escapes
the
myth
of
the
women
the
myth
of
the
negro
still
ensnares
her
18
among
the
double
burdens
that
feminists
faced
was
fighting
for
women
s
rights
as
well
as
rights
for
people
of
color
frances
m
beale
wrote
that
the
situation
of
black
women
was
full
of
misconceptions
and
distortions
of
the
truth
in
her
pamphlet
double
jeopardy
to
be
black
and
female
she
claimed
that
capitalism
was
the
direct
forebear
of
racism
because
the
system
was
indirectly
a
way
to
destroy
the
humanity
of
black
people
19
in
any
society
where
men
are
not
yet
free
women
are
less
free
because
we
are
further
enslaved
because
we
african
american
women
are
enslaved
by
our
sex
many
african
american
women
turned
towards
feminism
in
their
fight
against
oppression
because
there
was
an
awareness
that
they
were
being
treated
as
secondclass
citizens
within
the
civil
rights
movement
of
the
60
s
due
to
this
many
women
felt
that
they
were
being
asked
to
choose
between
a
black
movement
that
primarily
served
the
interest
of
black
male
patriarchs
and
a
women
s
movement
which
primarily
served
the
interests
of
racist
white
women
the
theory
of
double
consciousness
is
also
heavily
present
for
female
diasporic
artists
these
artists
are
faced
with
the
task
of
remaining
authentic
to
their
roots
while
still
branding
themselves
in
a
way
to
allow
international
and
mainstream
popularity
in
the
music
industry
women
of
color
are
often
stereotyped
as
being
hypersexual
and
aggressive
which
in
some
cases
helps
their
branding
and
in
other
cases
it
hurts
their
branding
and
the
identity
they
have
attempted
to
create
for
themselves
due
to
this
diasporic
female
artists
are
often
forced
to
privilege
certain
self
markers
and
conceal
others
depending
on
the
situation
often
making
them
feel
as
if
they
can
never
create
one
true
identity
for
themselves
but
must
rather
change
depending
on
the
circumstances

black
power
edit
the
first
portion
of
black
power
the
politics
of
liberation
labeled
white
power
by
kwame
ture
formerly
known
as
stokely
carmichael
and
charles
v
hamilton
provides
evidence
backing
up
the
ideology
of
double
consciousness
in
regards
to
black
people
in
the
united
states
the
book
opens
up
by
defining
racism
as
the
predication
of
decisions
and
policies
on
considerations
of
race
for
the
purpose
of
subordinating
a
racial
group
and
maintaining
control
over
that
group
hamilton
ture
3
therefore
the
subordinate
group
black
people
must
think
of
themselves
in
terms
of
the
oppressive
population
white
individual
racism
and
institutional
racism
both
contribute
to
double
consciousness
on
an
individual
level
double
consciousness
is
practiced
within
every
day
interactions
and
on
an
institutional
level
it
impacts
how
black
people
function
throughout
society
black
people
are
legal
citizens
of
the
united
states
with
for
the
most
part
the
same
legal
rights
as
other
citizens
yet
they
stand
as
colonial
subjects
in
relation
to
the
white
society
20
therefore
while
the
black
population
in
the
united
states
are
essentially
equal
to
whites
under
written
law
there
remain
deeply
rooted
inequities
between
the
races
that
reinforce
double
consciousness
because
these
differences
are
not
evident
under
the
u
s
constitution
and
the
bill
of
rights
they
are
an
experience
in
the
afrogerman
paradigm
edit
even
though
the
framework
of
double
consciousness
can
be
applied
to
an
african
diaspora
and
transnationality
the
nuances
of
racial
dynamics
differ
from
nation
to
nation
in
germany
for
example
the
political
exigencies
enforced
by
the
third
reich
created
a
more
nuanced
situation
tina
campt
notes
in
other
germans
black
germans
and
the
politics
of
race
gender
and
memory
in
the
third
reich
the
tension
for
afrogermans
who
came
of
age
during
the
totalitarian
regime
of
the
third
reich
was
not
necessarily
experienced
as
one
of
absolute
duality
or
twoness
rather
it
was
a
contradictory
and
complexly
textured
form
of
identity
21
due
to
the
absence
of
a
black
community
in
germany
most
afrogermans
did
not
have
the
option
of
choosing
between
a
black
community
or
identity
and
a
german
identity
21
they
were
essentially
forced
to
occupy
a
position
between
a
conception
of
german
identity
that
excluded
blackness
and
a
conception
of
blackness
that
precluded
any
identification
with
germanness
21
this
means
that
for
black
germans
during
the
third
reich
the
psychological
dilemmas
of
twoness
did
not
necessarily
map
onto
the
double
consciousness
dynamic
w
e
b
du
bois
first
identified
in
1897
for
black
germans
in
the
early
20th
century
there
was
no
stable
idea
or
community
of
blackness
with
which
they
could
fully
or

partly

phenomenon
of
group
members

group
consciousness
in
political
science
refers
to
the
phenomenon
in
which
members
within
a
social
identity
group
become
aware
of
how
their
group
identification
impacts
their
position
in
society
and
therefore
come
together
to
pursue
collective
action
to
advocate
for
their
shared
interests

group
consciousness
requires
two
necessary
preconditions
group
membership
and
group
identification
1
group
membership
is
the
objective
belonging
within
the
group
while
identification
refers
to
the
subjective
psychological
importance
of
the
group
to
the
member

the
intent
behind
group
consciousness
edit
group
consciousness
is
not
automatically
assumed
to
exist
with
any
organization
of
people
however
group
consciousness
often
stems
from
the
existence
of
group
agents
these
organizations
bring
people
together
through
common
purposes
and
intentions
that
they
act
upon
some
examples
of
group
agents
include
courts
corporations
ngos
and
other
collectives
of
individuals
6
group
consciousness
requires
unity
through
the
group
s
belief
in
a
set
of
ideological
beliefs
about
one
s
group
s
social
standing
groups
also
take
on
the
view
that
to
improve
their
social
standing
and
best
reach
their
goals
the
best
policy
is
to
pursue
collective
action
7
beyond
formal
organizations
like
corporations
and
nonprofits
group
consciousness
is
often
linked
to
socially
stratified
groups
including
class
gender
race
etc
when
discussing
racial
consciousness
specifically
group
consciousness
emerges
from
the
notion
that
people
s
identities
are
inseparable
from
their
race
as
a
result
minority
groups
particularly
oppressed
minority
groups
band
together
to
find
a
source
of
communal
support
in
america
specifically
africanamericans
specifically
have
been
historically
treated
as
part
of
a
racial
group
instead
of
recognized
for
their
individual
identities
researchers
have
therefore
connected
this
idea
of
linked
fate
meaning
the
viewpoint
that
one
s
fate
is
inextricably
linked
to
the
fate
of
their
racial
group
to
a
heightened
sense
of
group
consciousness

of
contention
within
the
philosophy
is
whether
or
not
the
“
consciousness
”
of
a
group
can
be
phenomenal
meaning
experiential
or
if
it
is
purely
a
sense
of
awareness
68
the
argument
has
been
made
that
entire
states
can
be
“
phenomenally
conscious
”
meaning
they
can
subjectively
experience
perceptions
and
sensations
as
one
entity
in
his
paper
“
if
materialism
is
true
the
united
states
is
probably
conscious
”
philosopher
eric
schwitzgebel
argues
that
the
united
states
experiences
a
consciousness
that
overrides
individual
citizens
schwitzgebel
posits
that
through
using
materialist
philosophy
it
may
be
argued
that
the
united
states
has
the
characteristics
also
present
in
what
materialists
consider
to
be
“
conscious
beings
”
in
this
case
we
can
take
materialism
to
mean
the
belief
that
solely
matter
rather
than
the
mind
or
ideas
can
be
treated
as
real
objects
in
the
context
of
group
consciousness
this
refers
to
the
controversial
debate
over
whether
a
group
can
function
as
its
own
being
or
if
group
consciousness
is
primarily
a
metaphor
schwitzgebel
believes
in
the
former
he
states
that
the
us
is
selfpreserving
goaloriented
and
can
respond
intelligently
to
threats
and
opportunities
the
us
functions
as
an
individual
entity
thus
the
united
states
can
be
said
to
have
a
concrete
identity
through
schwitzgebel
s
interpretation
of
group
consciousness
8
however
philosophers
like
christian
list
also
posit
that
group
agents
are
not
necessarily
phenomenally
conscious
within
his
paper
what
is
it
like
to
be
a
group
agent
he
argues
that
there
is
an
important
distinction
that
must
be
made
between
consciousness
as
awareness
and
as
experience
list
posits
that
group
agents
are
able
to
have
consciousness
as
awareness
a
group
agent
may
share
beliefs
and
act
on
then
but
it
is
the
individuals
in
this
group
who
are
aware
of
their
shared
identity
who
are
performing
the
action
group
consciousness
thus
doesn
t
mean
that
a
group
can
act
as
a
true
collective
singular
it
only
facilitates
collective
action

group
consciousness
within
feminism
edit
feminist
consciousness
is
defined
as
politicized
gender
identification
which
is
when
women
link
their
gender
identity
and
the
societal
issues
that
arise
alongside
it
with
a
set
of
political
beliefs
based
on
research
regarding
women
s
rights
activism
personality
and
life
experiences
can
be
seen
as
factors
that
lead
to
feminist
consciousness
for
instance
women
who
are
more
politically
engaged
tend
to
embrace
feminism
and
feminist
activism
than
women
who
are
not
in
addition
women
with
intersectional
identities
meaning
women
who
identify
with
more
than
one
marginalized
female
identity
are
also
more
likely
to
be
very
aware
of
their
group
membership
and
thus
develop
group
consciousness
for
example
lesbians
experience
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sexual
orientation
and
gender
they
are
therefore
more
likely
to
be
aware
of
their
oppression
and
seek
solace
in
group
solidarity
9
viewing
feminism
as
a
case
study
for
group
consciousness
demonstrates
how
even
within
collective
action
entities
there
are
outside

that
influence

extent
to
which

are

human
beings
are
conscious
not
only
of
the
world
around
them
but
also
of
themselves
their
activities
their
bodies
and
their
mental
lives
they
are
that
is
selfconscious
or
equivalently
selfaware
selfconsciousness
can
be
understood
as
an
awareness
of
oneself
but
a
selfconscious
subject
is
not
just
aware
of
something
that
merely
happens
to
be
themselves
as
one
is
if
one
sees
an
old
photograph
without
realising
that
it
is
of
oneself
rather
a
selfconscious
subject
is
aware
of
themselves
as
themselves
it
is
manifest
to
them
that
they
themselves
are
the
object
of
awareness
selfconsciousness
is
a
form
of
consciousness
that
is
paradigmatically
expressed
in
english
by
the
words
“
i
”
“
me
”
and
“
my
”
terms
that
each
of
us
uses
to
refer
to
ourselves
as
such
a
central
topic
throughout
the
history
of
philosophy
—
and
increasingly
so
since
the
seventeenth
century
—
the
phenomena
surrounding
selfconsciousness
prompt
a
variety
of
fundamental
philosophical
and
scientific
questions
including
its
relation
to
consciousness
its
semantic
and
epistemic
features
its
realisation
in
both
conceptual
and
nonconceptual
representation
and
its
connection
to
our
conception
of
an
objective
world
populated
with
others
like
ourselves

selfconsciousness
in
the
history
of
philosophy
a
familiar
feature
of
ancient
greek
philosophy
and
culture
is
the
delphic
maxim
“
know
thyself
”
but
what
is
it
that
one
knows
if
one
knows
oneself
in
sophocles
oedipus
oedipus
knows
a
number
of
things
about
himself
for
example
that
he
was
prophesied
to
kill
laius
but
although
he
knew
this
about
himself
it
is
only
later
in
the
play
that
he
comes
to
know
that
it
is
he
himself
of
whom
it
is
true
that
is
he
moves
from
thinking
that
the
son
of
laius
and
jocasta
was
prophesied
to
kill
laius
to
thinking
that
he
himself
was
so
prophesied
it
is
only
this
latter
knowledge
that
we
would
call
an
expression
of
selfconsciousness
and
that
we
may
presume
is
the
object
of
the
delphic
maxim
during
the
course
of
the
drama
oedipus
comes
to
know
himself
with
tragic
consequences
but
just
what
this
selfconsciousness
amounts
to
and
how
it
might
be
connected
to
other
aspects
of
the
mind
most
notably
consciousness
itself
is
less
clear
it
has
perhaps
unsurprisingly
been
the
topic
of
considerable
discussion
since
the
greeks
during
the
early
modern
period
selfconsciousness
became
central
to
a
number
of
philosophical
issues
and
with
kant
and
the
postkantians
came
to
be
seen
as
one
of
the
most
important
topics
in
epistemology
and
the
philosophy
of
mind

ancient
and
medieval
discussions
of
selfconsciousness
although
it
is
occasionally
suggested
that
a
concern
with
selfconsciousness
is
a
peculiarly
modern
phenomenon
originating
with
descartes
brinkmann
2005
it
is
in
fact
the
topic
of
lively
ancient
and
medieval
debates
many
of
which
prefigure
early
modern
and
contemporary
concerns

a
claim
suggestive
of
the
view
that
consciousness
entails
selfconsciousness
furthermore
according
to
aristotle
since
the
intellect
takes
on
the
form
of
that
which

an
assertion
that
was
interpreted
by
aristotle

medieval
commentators
as
the
view
that

depends

an

things

by
contrast
the
platonic
tradition
principally
through
the
influence
of
augustine
writing
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
centuries
is
associated
with
the
view
that
the
mind
“
gains

of
itself

itself

by
being
present
to
itself
thus
on
this
view
selfawareness
requires
no
awareness
of
outer
things
in
a
similar
vein
in
the
eleventh
century
avicenna
argues
by
way
of
his
flying
man
thought
experiment
that
a
newly
created
person
floating
in
a
void
with
all
senses
disabled
would
nevertheless
be
selfaware
thus
the
self
that
one
cognises
cannot
be
a
bodily
thing
of
which
one
is
aware
through
the
senses

on
such
views
and
in
contrast
to
the
aristotelian
picture
basic
selfawareness
is
neither
sensory
in
nature
nor
dependent
on
the
awareness
of
other
things
this
latter
claim
was
accepted
by
aquinas
writing
in
the
thirteenth
century
who
can
be
seen
as
synthesising
aspects
of
the
platonic
and
aristotelian
traditions
cory
2014
for
not
only
does
aquinas
claim
that
there
is
a
form
of
selfawareness
—
awareness
that
one
exists
—
for
which
“
the
mere
presence
of
the
mind
suffices
”
there
is
another
form
—
awareness
of
one
s
essence
—
that
as
aristotle
had
claimed
is
dependent
on
cognising
other
things
and
so
for
which
“
the
mere
presence
of
the
mind
does
not
suffice
”

this
ancient
and
medieval
debate
concerning
whether
the
mere
presence
of
the
mind
is
sufficient
for
selfawareness
is
related
to
another
concerning
whether
selfawareness
is
itself
sensory
in
character
or
put
another
way
whether
the
self
is
or
is
not
perceptible
aquinas
has
sometimes
been
interpreted
as
offering
a
positive
answer
to
this
question
sometimes
a
negative
answer

for

these
issues
were

with
a
variety
of
perspectives
represented
for
example
in
the
writing
of
the
eleventh
century
jain
writer
prabhācandra
there
appears
an
argument
very
much
like
avicenna
s
flying
man
argument
for
the
possibility
of
selfawareness
without
awareness
of
the
body
ganeri

whereas
various
thinkers
of
the
advaita
vendānta
school
argue
that
there
is
no
selfawareness
without
embodiment

there
were
therefore
wideranging
debates
in
the
ancient
and
medieval
period
not
only
about
the
nature
of
selfconsciousness
but
also
about
its
relation
to
other
aspects
of
the
mind
most
notably
sensory
perception

awareness
of

early
modern
discussions
of
selfconsciousness
central
to
the
early
modern
discussion
of
selfconsciousness
are
descartes
assertions
in
the
second
of
his
meditations
that
“
i
am
i
exist
is
necessarily
true
whenever
it
is
put
forward
by
me
or
conceived
in
my
mind
”
descartes
1641

and
in
both
his
discourse
and
principles
that
“
i
think
therefore
i
am
”
or
“
cogito
ergo
sum
”
descartes
1637

and

1644

see
the
discussion
of
reflection
in
the
entry
on
seventeenth
century
theories
of
consciousness
the
cogito
which
was
anticipated
by
augustine
on
the
trinity
10

pasnau
2002
ch
11
embodies
two
elements
of
selfawareness
—
awareness
that
one
is
thinking
and
awareness
that
one
exists
—
that
play
a
foundational
role
in
descartes
epistemological
project
as
such
it
is
crucial
for
descartes
that
the
cogito
is
something
of
which
we
can
be
absolutely
certain
but
whilst
most
commentators
are
happy
to
agree
that
both
“
i
am
thinking
”
and
“
i
exist
”
are
indubitable
there
is
a
great
deal
of
debate
over
the
grounds
for
such
certainty
and
over
the
form
of
the
cogito
itself

of

the
question

claims

internal
infallible
perception
that

are

locke

on

questions
about
the
nature
of
selfconsciousness
and
in
particular
over
whether

consciousness
of

self
were
as
lively
as

selfconsciousness
in
thought
one
natural
way
to
think
of
selfconsciousness
is
in
terms
of
a
subject
s
capacity
to
entertain
conscious
thought
about
herself
selfconscious
thoughts
are
thoughts
about
oneself
but
it
is
commonly
pointed
out
that
thinking
about
what
merely
happens
to
be
oneself
is
insufficient
for
selfconsciousness
rather
one
must
think
of
oneself
as
oneself
if
one
is
capable
of
selfconscious
thought
that
is
one
must
be
able
to
think
in
such
a
way
that
it
is
manifest
to
one
that
it
is
oneself
about
whom
one
is
thinking
it
is
widely
recognised
that
the
paradigmatic
linguistic
expression
of
selfconsciousness
in
english
is
the
firstperson
pronoun
“
i
”
a
term
with
which
one
might
be
said
to
refer
to
oneself
as
oneself
sainsbury
2011
plausibly
every
utterance
of
a
sentence
containing
“
i
”
is
expressive
of
a
selfconscious
“
ithought
”
that
is
a
thought
containing
the
firstperson
concept
thus
discussions
of
selfconsciousness
are
often
closely
associated
with
accounts
of
the
semantics
of
the
indexical
term
“
i
”
and
the
nature
of
its
counterpart

concept

there
is
an

in
certain
ascriptions

belief
containing
“

”
“

”
or
“
they
”
i
may
say
“
jane

that
she
is
f
”
without
implying
that
jane
realises
that
it
is
herself
that
she
believes
to
be
f
that
is
there
is
a
reading
of
“
jane
believes
that
she
is
f
”
that
does
not
imply
selfconsciousness
on
jane
s
part
but
in
some
cases
we
do
intend
to
attribute
selfconsciousness
with
that
same
form
of
words
to
resolve
this
ambiguity
castañeda
introduces
“
she
”
for
selfconscious
attributions
i
will
use
the
more
natural
indirect
reflexive
“
she
herself
”
thus
“
jane
believes
that
she
is
f
”
does
not
imply
that
jane
selfconsciously
believes
that
she
is
f
whilst
“
jane
believes
that
she
herself
is
f
”

the

arguments
for
this
view
have
typically
appealed
to
the
essential
role
seemingly
played
by
the
firstperson
in
explanations
of
action
see
the
entry
on
selflocating
beliefs
this
point
is
supported
by
a
number
of
wellknown
examples
consider
perry
s
case
of
the
messy
shopper
i
once
followed
a
trail
of
sugar
on
a
supermarket
floor
pushing
my
cart
down
the
aisle
on
one
side
of
a
tall
counter
and
back
the
aisle
on
the
other
seeking
the
shopper
with
the
torn
sack
to
tell
him
he
was
making
a
mess
with
each
trip
around
the
counter
the
trail
became
thicker
but
i
seemed
unable
to
catch
up
finally
it
dawned
on
me
i
was
the
shopper
i
was
trying
to
catch
perry
1979
33
as
perry
points
out
he
knew
all
along
that
the
shopper
with
the
torn
sack
was
making
a
mess
he
may
also
have
believed
that
the
oldest
philosopher
in
the
shop
in
fact
himself
was
making
a
mess
yet
failed
to
check
his
own
cart
since
he
falsely
believed
that
quine
was
at
the
deli
counter
indeed
it
seems
that
for
any
nonindexical
term
a
that
denotes
perry
it
is
possible
for
perry
to
fail
to
believe
anything
naturally
expressed
by
the
sentence
“
i
am
a
”
if
so
it
is
possible
for
perry
to
rationally
believe
that
a
is
making
a
mess
without
believing
anything
that
he
would
express
as
“
i
am
making
a
mess
”
it
was
only
when
perry
came
to
believe
that
he
himself
was
making
a
mess
that
he
stopped
the
chase
indeed
it
would
seem
that
only
the
firstpersonal
content
can
provide
an
adequate
explanation
of
perry
s
behaviour
when
he
stops
if
perry
had
come
to
believe
that
john
perry
is
making
a
mess
then
unless
he
also
believed
that
he
himself
was
john
perry
he
would
not
have
stopped
the
firstpersonal
content
is
“
selflocating
”
thereby
enabling
action
whereas
the
nonfirstpersonal
content
is
not
to
use
kaplan
s
1977
example
if
i
believe
that
my
pants
are
on
fire
pure
selfinterest
will
surely
motivate
me
do
something
about
it
if
however
i
believe
that
smith
s
pants
are
on
fire
pure
selfinterest
will
only
so
motivate
me
if
i
also
believe
that
i
am
smith
on
this
widely
accepted
picture
then
firstpersonal
thought
and
language
is
irreducible
to
nonfirstpersonal
thought
and
language
and
is
essential
to
the
explanation
of
action

importantly
on
perry
s
view
what
is
irreducible
is
the
firstpersonal
way
of
thinking
about
ourselves
not
the
facts
or
states
of
affairs
that
make
such
thoughts
true
so
whilst
my
belief
“
i
am
f
”
is
not
equivalent
to
any
nonfirstpersonal
belief
it
is
true
if
and
only
if
smith
is
f
this
being
the
same
fact
that
makes
true
the
nonfirstpersonal
“
smith
is
f
”
thus
whilst
firstperson
representations
are
special
a
special
class
of

facts
are

to
be
found

views
that
do
accept

argues
that
terms
such
as
“
i
”
which
are
as
he
puts
it
“
essentially
indexical
”
pose
a
problem
for
the
traditional
fregean
view
of
belief
as
a
twoplace
relation
between
a
subject
and
a
proposition
cf
spencer
2007
fregean
senses
are
according
to
perry
descriptive
and
as
perry
has
argued
no
description
is
equivalent
to
an
essential
indexical
consequently
no
fregean
proposition
can
be
the
thing
believed
when
one
believes
firstpersonally
essential
indexicality
if
somehow
forced
into
the
fregean
mould
means
that
we
must
implausibly
accept
that
there
are
incommunicable
senses
that
only
the
speaker
or
thinker
is
in
a
position
to
grasp
see
garcíacarpintero
torre
2016
cf
evans
1981
longworth

d
lewis
goes
further
than
this
arguing
partly
on
the
basis
of
his
much
discussed
two
gods
example
1979
in
which
each
god
knows
all
the
propositions
true
at
their
world
yet
fails
to
know
which
of
the
two
gods
he
himself
is
that
the
objects
of
belief
are
not
propositions
at
all
but
rather
properties
or
centred
worlds
that
is
since
they
already
know
all
the
true
propositions
there
is
no
true
proposition
the
gods
would
come
to
believe
when
they
come
to
realise
which
god
they
are
essential
indexicality
forces
us
away
from
the
model
of
propositions
as
the
objects
of
belief
further
lewis
claims
that
not
just
the
explicitly
indexical
cases
but
all
belief
is
in
this
way
selflocating
or
in
his
terminology
de
se
on
this
account
every
belief
involves
the
selfascription
of
a
property
and
so
arguably
is
an
instance
of
selfconsciousness
for
discussion

arguments
such
as
perry
s
might
be
challenged
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
not
possible
to
rationally
doubt
that
one
is
the
subject
of
these
conscious
states
where
that
formulation
involves
an
“
introspective
demonstrative
”
picking
out
one
s
current
conscious
states
this
it
might
be
claimed
constitutes
a
reduction
of
firstperson
content
cf
peacocke
1983
ch
5
although
his
goal
is
not
reductive
even
if
it
is
true
however
that
one
cannot
doubt
that
one
is
the
subject
of
these
conscious
states
it
is
not
clear
that
this
poses
a
significant
challenge
to
perry
s
argument
for
the
essential
indexicality
of
the
firstperson
for
one
thing
the
content
itself
contains
a
demonstrative
so
indexical
element
second
it
has
been
argued
that
our
capacity
to
refer
to
our
own
experiences
itself
depends
on
our
capacity
to
refer
to
ourselves
as
ourselves

that
is
to
think
of
these
conscious
states
is
to
think
of
them
as
these
conscious
states
of
mine
if
to
demonstratively
think
of
one
s
conscious
state
is
necessarily
to
think
of
it
as
one
s
own
conscious
state
then
the
purported
reduction
of
firstperson
thought
to
thought
not
containing

will

a

attack
on
the
constellation
of
philosophical
claims
surrounding
the
“

”
including
its

a

element
in
their
critique
is
the
claim
that
cases

thought
to
show
the
special
connection

firstperson
reference
because
of
its
connection
with
the
firstperson
pronoun
it
is
often
taken
as
platitudinous
to
say
that
selfconscious
thought
is
closely
associated
with
the
capacity
to
refer
to
oneself
as
oneself
when
i
think
selfconsciously
i
cannot
fail
to
refer
to
myself
more
than
this
it
has
often
been
claimed
that
for
a
central
class
of
firstperson
thoughts
there
is
no
possibility
of
misidentifying
myself
not
only
can
i
not
fail
to
pick
myself
out
i
cannot
take
another
person
to
be
me
but
firstperson
reference
and
indexicality
more
generally
has
sometimes
been
thought
to
pose
a
challenge
to
theories
of
reference
requiring
special
treatment
indeed
some
have
argued
that
the
platitude
itself
should
be
rejected
terms
whose
function
it
is
to
refer
can
on
occasion
fail
in
that
function
a
use
of
the
term
“
vulcan
”
to
refer
to
the
planet
orbiting
between
mercury
and
the
sun
fails
to
refer
to
anything
for
the
reason
that
there
is
nothing
for
it
to
refer
to
if
i
see
the
head
of
one
dachshund
protruding
from
behind
a
tree
and
the
rear
end
of
another
protruding
from
the
other
side
of
the
tree
and
utter
“
that
dog
is
huge
”
my
use
of
“
that
dog
”
has
arguably
failed
to
refer
due
to
there
being
too
many
objects
it
would
seem
that
by
contrast
the
term
“
i
”
cannot
fail
to
refer
either
by
there
being
too
few
or
too
many
objects
“
i
”
is
guaranteed
to
refer
as
an
indexical
the
referent
of
“
i
”
varies
with
the
context
of
utterance
see
the
entry
on
indexicals
that
is
“
i
”
refers
to
different
people
depending
on
who
utters
it
following
kaplan
1977
it
is
common
to
think
of
the
meaning
of
such
terms
as
determining
a
function
from
context
to
referent
in
the
case
of
“
i
”
a
natural
proposal
is
the
“
selfreference
rule
”
srr
that
the
referent
of
a
token
of
“
i
”
is
the
person
that
produces
it
kaplan

“

”
is
thus
unlike
“
this
”
or
“

srr
captures
the
plausible
thought
that
“
i
”
is
guaranteed
against
reference
failure
since
every
token
of
“
i
”
has
been
produced
the
fact
that
“
i
”
refers
to
its
producer
means
that
there
is
no
chance
of
its
failing
to
pick
out
some
entity
this
account
of
“
i
”
then
treats
it
as
not
only
expressive
of
selfconsciousness
but
also
guaranteed
to
refer
to
the
utterer
srr
is
kaplan
s
specification
of
the
character
of
“
i
”
which
is
fixed
independently
of
the
context
of
any
particular
utterance
this
character
is
to
be
distinguished
from
the
content
of
a
tokening
of
“
i
”
which
it
has
only
in
a
context
on
kaplan
s
account
the
content
of
an
utterance
of
“
i
am
f
”
will
be
a
singular
proposition
composed
of
the
person
that
produced
it
and
fness

for
an
account
that
attributes
to
the
utterance

intuitively
plausible
as
it
is
srr
is
open
to
a
number
of
potential
counterexamples
suppose
for
example
that
you
are
away
from

due
to
illness
and
i
leave
a
note
on
your
door
reading
“
i
am
not
here
now
”
plausibly
whilst
it
was
me
that
produced
this
token
of
“
i
”
it
nevertheless
refers
to
you
or
consider
a
situation
in
which
i
walk
into
a
petrol
station
point
to
my
car
and
say
“
i
m
empty
”
in
this
case
it
might
be
suggested
my
use
of
“

refers
to
my
car

than
myself

so
arguably
some

fail
to
express
the

although

didn

in

an
earlier
criticism
of
such
a
rule
can
be
found
in
the
work
of
anscombe
1975
who
argues
that
the

cannot
be
complete
as
an
account
of
the
meaning
of
“

”
for

see
o
brien
1994
anscombe
considers
a
world
in
which
each
person
has
two
names
one
of
which
ranging
from
“
b
”
to
“
z
”
is
printed
on
their
chest
the
other
in
every
case
“
a
”
is
printed
on
the
inside
of
their
wrist
each
person
uses
“
b
”
to
“
z
”
when
attributing
actions
to
others
but
“
a
”
when
describing
their
own
actions
anscombe
1975
49
anscombe
argues
that
such
a
situation
is
compatible
with
the
possibility
that
the
people
in
question
lack
selfconsciousness
whilst
b
uses
“
a
”
to
refer
to
b
c
uses
“
a
”
to
refer
to
c
and
so
on
there
is
no
guarantee
that
they
are
thinking
of
themselves
as
themselves
for
they
may
be
reporting
what
are
in
fact
their
own
actions
without
thinking
of
those
actions
as
things
that
they
themselves
are
performing
they
may
treat
themselves
that
is
just
as
the
treat
any
other
this
is
despite
the
fact
that
in
this
scenario
“
a
”
complies
with
srr
can
the
selfreference
rule
be
reformulated
in
such
a
way
as
to
entail
selfconsciousness
on
the
part
of
those
who
use
terms
that
comply
with
it
according
to
anscombe
it
can
but
any
such
reformulation
will
presuppose
a
prior
grasp
of
selfconscious
reference
to
oneself
for
example
if
we
say
employing
the
indirect
reflexive
that
“
i
”
is
a
term
that
a
person
uses
to
refer
to
she
herself
we
have
travelled
in
a
tight
circle
since
“
she
herself
”
can
be
understood
only
in
terms

that
the

that

however
does
appear
to
be

than
this
claiming
that
the
“

”
in
which
each
of

is

to

is
simply
that

this
claim
it
would
seem
is
indeed
open
to
anscombe
s
challenge
anscombe
s
1975
paper
is
perhaps
most
notable
for
her
claim
that
“
i
”
is
not
a
referring
expression
at
all
assuming
that
if
“
i
”
refers
it
must
be
understood
on
the
model
of
either
a
proper
name
a
demonstrative
or
an
abbreviation
of
a
definite
description
anscombe
argues
that
each
of
these
kinds
of
referring
expression
requires
what
she
calls
a
“
conception
”
by
means
of
which
it
reaches
its
referent
this
conception
must
explain
the
seemingly
guaranteed
reference
of
“
i
”
the
apparent
fact
that
no
token
of
“
i
”
can
fail
to
pick
out
an
object
however
she
argues
no
satisfactory
conception
can
be
specified
for
“
i
”
since
either
it
fails
to
deliver
up
guaranteed
reference
or
it
succeeds
but
only
by
delivering
an
immaterial
soul
since
we
have
independent
reason
to
believe
that
there
are
no
immaterial
souls
it
follows
that
“
i
”
cannot
be
understood
on
the
model
of
a
proper
name
demonstrative
or
definite
description
so
is
not
a
referring
expression
for
positive
appraisals

position

that
“
i
”
does
not
function
as
either
a
name
or
an
abbreviated

is
widely
accepted
the
more
contentious
aspect
of
anscombe
s
case
for
the
view
that
there
is
no
appropriate
conception
for
“
i
”
is
her
claim
that
“
i
”
does
not
function
like
a
demonstrative
her
argument
for
this
claim
is
highly
reminiscent
of
avicenna
s
flying
man
argument
see
§

with
which
she
was
surely
familiar
we
can
she
tells
us
imagine
a
subject
in
a
sensory
deprivation
tank
who
has
been
anaesthetised
and
is
suffering
from
amnesia
such
a
subject
would
claims
anscombe
be
able
to
think
ithoughts
perhaps
wondering
“
how
did
i
get
into
this
mess
”
since
such
a
subject
can
think
selfconsciously
in
the
absence
of
any
presented
referent
it
follows
that
“
i
”
cannot
mean
something
like
“
this
person
”
since
demonstratives
require
the
demonstrated
object
to
be
presented
to
conscious
awareness
treating
“
i
”
on
a
demonstrative
model
then
fails

the
problem
with
anscombe
s
argument
is
that
it
fails
to
appreciate
that
“

”
can
be
modelled
on
“

”
rather
than
“

according
to

the
similarity
between

ideas
shows
up
in
their
functional
role
for
an
alternative

functional
account
see

for
an
argument
that
far
from
being
amenable
to

analysis

poses
a
threat

the
coherence
of
functionalism

we

both

grounds
involve
the
use
of
“
i
”
as
subject
and
so
are
immune
to
this
sort
of
error
of
misidentification
immunity
to
this
sort
of
error
should
not
be
conflated
with
another
sort
of
epistemic
security
that
is
often
discussed
under
the
heading
of
selfknowledge
see
entry
on
selfknowledge
some
philosophers
have
held
that
for
a
range
of
mental
states
one
cannot
be
mistaken
about
whether
one
is
in
them
thus
for
example
if
one
sincerely
judges
that
one
has
a
pain
or
that
one
believes
that
p
then
it
cannot
turn
out
that
one
is
not
in
pain
or
that
one
does
not
so
believe
that
the
kind
of
immunity
to
error
described
by
wittgenstein
differs
from
this
sort
of
epistemic
security
follows
from
the
fact
that
one
may
be
sceptical
of
the
latter
while
accepting
the
former
that
is
one
may
reject
the
claim
that
sincere
judgements
that
one
has
a
pain
cannot
be
mistaken
perhaps
it
is
possible
to
mistake
a
sensation
of
coldness
for
one
of
pain
whilst
nevertheless
maintaining
that
if
one
is
introspectively
aware
of
a
pain
then
that
pain
must
be
one
s
own
immunity
to
errors
of
this
sort
has
been
taken
by
a
number
of
philosophers
to
be
importantly
connected
to
selfconsciousness
under
the
influence
of
shoemaker
1968
this
phenomenon
has
become
known
as
immunity
to
error
through
misidentification
relative
to
the
firstperson
pronoun
or
iem
on
shoemaker
s
formulation
an
error
of
misidentification
occurs
when
one
knows
some
particular
thing
a
to
be
f
and
judges
that
b
is
f
on
the
grounds
that
one
mistakenly
believes
that
a
is
identical
to
b
to
this
it
is
important
to
add
that
iem
is
not
a
feature
that
judgements
possess
in
virtue
of
their
content
alone
but
only
relative
to
certain
grounds
perception
testimony
introspection
memory
etc
thus
the
judgement
that
i
am
jealous
of
a
might
be
iem
when
grounded
in
introspection
but
not
when
grounded
in
the
overheard
testimony
of
my
analyst
for
i
may
have
misinterpreted
my
analyst
s
words
wrongly
taking
his
use
of
“
smith
”
in
“
smith
is
jealous
of
a
”
to
refer
to
me
“
smith
”
after
all
is
a
common
name
iem
is
always
relative
then
to
the
grounds
on
which
a
judgement
is
based
which
grounds
might
give
rise
to
firstperson
judgements
that
are
iem
is
a
contested
matter
see
the
supplement
the
scope
of
immunity
to
error
through
misidentification
on
this
account
firstperson
thoughts
will
be
iem
relative
to
certain
grounds
just
in
case
errors
of
misidentification
are
not
possible
with
respect
to
them
that
is
they
will
be
iem
relative
to
grounds
g
if
and
only
if
it
is
not
possible
that
one
knows
via
g
some
particular
thing
a
to
be
f
and
judges
oneself
to
be
f
in
virtue
of
mistakenly
believing
that
a
is
identical
to
oneself
whilst
precise
formulations
differ
in
various
ways
this
can
reasonably
be
thought
of
as
the
standard
account
of
iem

an
alternative
way
of
formulating
iem
can
be
found
in
the
work
of
variety
of
philosophers
on
this
view
a
judgement
“
a
is
f
”
is
iem
if
and
only
if
it
is
not
possible
to
undercut
one
s
evidence
for
judging
that
a
is
f
without
thereby
undercutting
one
s
evidence
that
someone
is
f
for

this
idea

as
wright
puts
it
a
claim
made
on
a
certain
kind
of
ground
involves
immunity
to
error
through
misidentification
just
when
its
defeat
is
not
consistent
with
retention
of
grounds
for
existential
generalization
1998

the
idea
is
that
for
a
wide
range
of
judgements
it
is
possible
that
one
knows
that
something
is
f
but
wrongly
supposes
that
a
is
f
that
is
one
has
misidentified
which
thing
is
f
for
other
judgements
perhaps
including
the
introspection
based
judgement
that
one
has
a
headache
this
sort
of
identification
error
is
not
possible
after
pryor
s
1999
influential
discussion
this
is
typically
known
as
immunity
to
whichmisidentification
or
whiem
that
whiem
is
a
distinct
phenomenon
from
iem
as
it
is
standardly
formulated
is
shown
by
the
fact
one
may
consistently
claim
that
a
form
of
experience
for
example
memory
does
not
put
one
in
a
position
to
think
of
some
a
distinct
from
oneself
that
a
was
f
yet
nevertheless
does
put
one
in
a
position
to
think
that
someone
was
f
that
is
it
might
give
rise
to
judgements
that
are
iem
but
not
whiem
the
converse
however
is
not
possible
for
since
“
a
was
f
”
entails
“
someone
was
f
”
it
will
not
be
possible
for
a
judgement
relative
to
some
grounds
to
be
whiem
without
it
also
being
iem
if
a
judgement
is
based
on
an
identification
it
will
be
subject
to
errors
of
whmisidentification
for
this
reason
whiem
might
legitimately
be
considered
the
more
fundamental
notion
as
it
is
by
pryor
1999
what
is
the
philosophical
significance
of
iem
first
consider
what
it
would
take
for
a
form
of
experience
to
ground
thoughts
that
are
iem
suppose
that
a
form
of
experience
introspection
for
example
itself
has
firstpersonal
content
that
is
suppose
that
the
content
of
introspective
awareness
is
not
adequately
conceptualised
as
pain
but
rather
requires
the
firstpersonal
form
my
pain
if
so
then
there
would
be
no
need
for
an
identification
of
some
object
as
oneself
for
the
identity
of
the
subject
of
pain
is
already
given
as
oneself
on
this
way
of
thinking
to
determine
which
forms
of
experience
ground
judgements
that
are
iem
would
be
to
determine
which
forms
of
experience
have
firstpersonal
content
and
that
according
to
some
philosophers
is
to
determine
which
forms
of
experience
are
themselves
forms
of
selfconsciousness
see
for
example
bermúdez
1998

this
issue
is
further
discussed
in
§

second
wittgenstein
suggests
that
the
phenomenon
of
iem
is
responsible
for
the
in
his
view
mistaken
opinion
that
the
use
of
“
i
”
as
subject
refers
to
an
immaterial
soul
1958
66
this
is
for
the
reason
that
one
may
be
tempted
to
suppose
that
if
introspectively
based
selfascriptions
of
psychological
predicates
do
not
rely
on
an
identification
of
a
bodily
entity
they
must
rely
on
the
identification
of
a
nonbodily
entity

that
they
rely

at
all
as
evans
puts
it
they
are

essentially
the
same
point
is
made
by
strawson
in
his
diagnosis
of
“
the
fact
that
lies
at
the
root
of
the
cartesian
illusion
”
which
is
that
“

in

the
fact

of

thoughts
depend
for
their
reference
on
no

as

some

claim
that
there
is
a
form
of
selfconsciousness
in

one
which
arguably
grounds
the
capacity
to
entertain
firstpersonal
thought
can
be
understood
in
a
number
of
ways
according
to
one
view
there
is
a
perceptual
or
quasiperceptual
consciousness
of
the
self
as
an
object
of

on
another
there
is
a
“
prereflective
”
form
of
selfconsciousness
that
does
not
involve
the
awareness
of
the
self
as
an
object
a
third
claims
that
various
forms
of
experience
involve
a
distinctive
“

”
in
which
each
of
us
is
aware

consciousness
of

it
is
natural
to
suppose
that
selfconsciousness
is
fundamentally
a

of

on

a
view
one
is
selfconscious
if
when

of

that

as
with
firstperson
thought
the
issue
is
not
whether
one
is
or
can
be
conscious
of
what
is
in
fact
oneself
if
that
were
sufficient
for
selfconsciousness
then
on
the
supposition
that
one
is
identical
to
one
s
body
seeing
oneself
in
a
mirror
would
be
a
case
of
selfconsciousness
even
if
one
were
unaware
that
it
was
oneself
that
one
saw
rather
the
issue
is
whether
one
is
or
can
be
conscious
of
oneself
as
oneself
a
form
of
awareness
in
which
it
is
manifest
to
one
that
the
object
of
awareness
is
oneself
if
there
is
such
an
awareness
then
this
is
philosophically
significant
since
one
might
expect
it
to
ground
certain
cases
of
selfknowledge
firstperson
reference
and
the
immunity
to
error
of
certain
firstperson
thoughts
shoemaker
1986
see
the
entry
on
selfknowledge
the
inner
consciousness
of
the
self
as
f
for
example
would
account
for
one
s
capacity
to
refer
to
oneself
as
oneself
one
s
knowledge
that
one
is
f
and
the
fact
that
such
a
thought
cannot
rest
on
a
misidentification
of
another
thing
as
oneself
on
the
other
hand
the
claim
that
there
is
no
such
conscious
awareness
of
the
self
is
philosophically
significant
not
only
because
it
undermines
the
possibility
of
such
explanations
but
also
for
the
reason
that
it
plays
an
important
role
in
various
well
known
arguments
for

in

critique

obviously
the

postscript
a
simple
argument
for
the
claim
that
we
are
introspectively
aware
of
ourselves
is
that
in
introspection
one
is
perceptually
aware
of
one
s
own
mental
properties
and
that
when
one
perceives
a
property
one
perceives
that
which
has
that
property
i
e
oneself
shoemaker
1984b
1986
agrees
that
if
there
is
an
introspective
awareness
of
the
self
as
an
object
then
it
should
be
understood
as
a
form
of
selfperception
he
argues
however
that
on
a
plausible
account
of
perception
introspection
is
not
a
form
of
perception
so
we
do
not
introspectively
perceive
anything
including
the
self
as
such
we
cannot
conclude
in
this
way
that
we
are
introspectively
aware
of
the
self
cf
martin
1997
rosenthal

shoemaker
further
argues
in
a
way
reminiscent
of
the
heidelberg
school
frank
1995
musholt
2015
ch
1
that
the
postulation
of
an
introspective
awareness
of
the
self
as
the
self
would
not
be
in
a
position
to
explain
all
selfknowledge
according
to
shoemaker
1984b
105
if
inner
perception
revealed
an
object
to
be
f
then
i
would
only
be
in
a
position
to
judge
that
i
am
f
if
i
already
took
myself
to
be
that
object
that
i
perceive
but
this
both
presupposes
some
nonperceptual
selfknowledge
i
e
that
i
am
the
thing
perceived
via
inner
sense
and
also
implausibly
opens
up
introspection
based
firstperson
thought
to
the
possibility
of
errors
of
misidentification
since
such
a
view
would
entail
that
introspective
selfknowledge
is
based
in
part
on
an
identification
of
the
self
a
number
of
philosophers
have
maintained
that
even
if
hume
is
right
that
introspection
does
not
reveal
the
self
as
an
object
there
is
another
form
of

on
this
view
through

i
am
aware
of
my
body
“
from

inside
”
as
a
bodily
self
as
me
brewer
1995
for
example
argues
that
since
bodily
sensations
are
both
manifestly
properties
of
oneself
and
are
perceived
as
located
properties
of
one
s
body
it
follows
that
in
bodily
awareness
one
perceives
one
s
body
as
oneself
if
one
s
body
is
presented
as
oneself
in
bodily
awareness
then
as
mentioned
above
we
might
expect
this
bodily
selfperception
to
ground
firstperson
thought
about
one
s
bodily
states
as
pointed
out
in
§
2
it
is
plausible
that
firstperson
thoughts
cannot
fail
to
refer
to
their
thinker
and
further
that
this
is
manifest
in
the
thinking
of
them
martin
1995
1997
argues
on
the
basis
of
these
two
claims
that
if
bodily
awareness
is
a
form
of
selfawareness
then
one
s
body
as
presented
in
bodily
awareness
must
manifestly
be
oneself
that
is
if
a
form
of
awareness
is
to
ground
judgements
which
are
manifestly
about
myself
then
that
form
of
awareness
must
manifestly
be
an
awareness
of
myself
but
this
is
arguably
a
condition
that
it
does
not
meet
since
it
is
perfectly
coherent
to
wonder
whether
or
not
one
is
identical
to
one
s
body
just
as
descartes
famously
did
in
the
meditations
for
a
different
imaginationbased
argument
against
bodily
awareness
as
a
form
of
selfawareness

indeed
it
might
be
argued
that
the

s
possessing
some
form
of

follows
from
the
connection
between

to
have
been
established
by
considerations
of
the

prereflective
selfawareness
is
“
prereflective
”
according
to
its
proponents
in
the
sense
that
it
does
not
require
one
to
explicitly
reflect
on
one
s
own
mental
states
or
to
otherwise
take
them
as
objects
of
attention
rather
prereflective
selfawareness
is
manifest
even
in
those
situations
in
which
one
s
attention
is
directed
outwards
toward
worldly
objects
and
events
prereflective
selfawareness
then
is
implicit
in
all
consciousness
providing
one
with
a
continuous
awareness
of
oneself
as
the
subject
of
one
s
stream
of
experience
one
way
in
which
such
views
can
be
understood
is
as
maintaining
that
experience
involves
selfconsciousness
in
the
mode
rather
than
the
content
of
conscious
experience

this
can
be
fleshed
out
by
analogy
with
the
case
of
belief
one
might
claim
that
the
concept
of
truth
figures
in
the
mode
but
not
the
explicit
content
of
every
belief
that
is
whilst
every
belief
is
a
holding
true
it
is
not
the
case
that
every
belief
has
the
content
that
such
and
such
is
true
similarly
whilst
every
experience
is
an
experience
of
one
s
own
it
is
not
the
case
that
every
experience
has
the
content
that
such
and
such
is
experienced
by
oneself
rather
the
mode
of
conscious
experience
introspection
bodily
awareness
etc
includes
an
implicit
awareness
of
the
self
a
related
view
is
that
the
self
can
be
considered
an
“
unarticulated
constituent
”
of
the
experience
just
as
some
claim
that
“
here
”
is
an
unarticulated
constituent
of

it

so
just
as
the

who
believes
“

”
is
implicitly
aware
of
the
fact
that
it
is
here
that
it

so
the

of

experience
is
implicitly
aware
of
the
fact
that
it
is
she
herself
who
is
undergoing
that
experience
accounts
of
selfconsciousness
as
involving
unarticulated
constituents
or
as
implicit
in
the
mode
of
consciousness
will
need
to
explain
how
the
transition
is
made
from
such
implicit
selfawareness
to
the
explicit
representation
of
the
self
in
firstperson
thought
one
option
is
to
appeal
to
the
idea
that
certain
sources
of
information
are
selftracking
or
in
perry
s
2012
words
“
necessarily
selfinformative
”
a
form
of
experience
is
selftracking
if
it
is
a
way
of
coming
to
know
of
the
instantiation
of
properties
of
a
certain
type
and
necessarily
a
subject
can
come
to
know
in
that
way
of
the
instantiation
of
her
own
states
only
for
example
if
it
is
true
that
a
subject
can
only
remember
conscious
episodes
from
her
own
past
then
episodic
memory
is
selftracking
if
so
then
the
subject
may
legitimately
think
the
firstperson
thought
“
i
was
f
”
on
the
basis
of
her
episodic
memory
of
being
f
this
account
may
also
be
used
to
explain
iem
since
if
a
form
of
experience
is
selftracking
then
it
will
not
be
possible
for
me
to
know
in

way
that

according
to
some
a
fundamental
aspect
of

that
they

arguably
does
some
work
in
explaining
why
it
seems
difficult
to
conceive
of
what
it
would

to
experience
a

for
such
an
experience
would
involve
being
aware
of
a
thought
that
seemed
to
be
mine
but
as
located
in
a
mind
that
did

seem
to

the
sense
of
ownership
is
also
a
candidate
for
explaining
immunity
to
error
through
misidentification
since
if
conscious
experiences
seem
to
be
one
s
own
then
there
is
presumably
no
need
for
any
identification
of
the
experience
s
subject
as
oneself
whilst
the
sense
of
ownership
would
presumably
be
accounted
for
by
an
introspective
awareness
of
the
self
it
can
also
arguably
be
explained
with
the
more
minimal
commitments
of
the
implicit
view
the
sense
of
an
experience
as
my
own
can
be
understood
as
nothing
over
and
above

thus
the

according
to
this
standard
view
cases
of
thought
insertion
or
anarchic

for

can
be
wholly
explained
by
postulating
a
lack
of
a
sense
of
agency
the
usual
sense
of
being
the
agent
of
a
thought
is
lacking
but
the
sense
of
ownership
remains
since
the
thought
seems
to
the
subject
be
taking
place
in
their
own
mind
we
might
however
wish
to
make
a
threeway
distinction
between
the
sense
of
agency
the
sense
that
one
is
the
author
of
a
mental
state
the
sense
of
ownership
the
sense
that
one
is
the
owner
of
a
mental
state
and
what
we
might
call
the
sense
of
location
the
sense
that
a
mental
state
is
located
within
one
s
own
mind
the
sense
of
location
might
be
understood
as
being
possessed
if
one
is
aware
of
a
mental
state
in
the
ordinary
way
i
e
introspectively
crucial
it
would
seem
for
evaluating
the
significance
of
thought
insertion
and
related
cases
and
so
of
the
standard
view
will
be
determining
which
if
any
of
the
senses
of
agency
ownership
or
location
remain
intact
for
it
might
be
argued
that
what
such
subjects
retain
is
in
fact
the
sense
of
location
rather
than
the
sense
of
ownership
that
is
it
may
be
possible
to
take
their
descriptions
at
face
value
when
they
deny
in
thought
insertion
for
example
that
the
thoughts
in
question
are
their
own
or
were
thought
by
them
whilst
nevertheless
accepting
that
the

thought
occurs
within

personhood
one
reason
for
doubt
on
this
score
is
that
since
it
is
concerned
with
selfconscious
thought
the
account
provides
no
reason
to
suppose
that
creatures
that
enjoy
nonconceptual
selfconsciousness
are
persons
a
second
is
that
the
requirement
of
being
able
to
reidentify
oneself
over
time
is
not
one
that
we
need
consider
met
by
all
selfconscious
creatures
for
we
can
suppose
it
is
possible
for
a
selfconscious
subject
to
lack
the
conceptual
sophistication
to
understand
the
past
and
future
tense
an
alternative
conception
of
personhood
that
also
gives
a
central
role
to
selfconsciousness
can
be
found
in
frankfurt
s
claim
that
it
is
essential
to
persons
to
have
a
capacity
for
reflective
selfevaluation
manifested
in
the
possession
of
what
he
calls
“
secondorder
volitions
”

secondorder
volitions
involve
wanting
a
certain
desire
to
be
one
s
will
that
is
wanting
it
to
move

to

a
subject
with
secondorder
volitions
has
the
capacity
to
evaluate
their
firstorder
desires
and
this
it
would
seem
involves
being
aware
of
them
as
potentially
their
own
thus
persons
thought
of
as

the

that

it
may

contrasts
on

with

calls
the
“

according

to
say
that
the

on

to
say
that
it
is
“

prior
”
to

concepts

and

persons
are
not
to
be
thought
of
as

strawson
argues
that
the
primitiveness
of
the

his
argument
is
that
one
can
only
selfascribe
states
of
consciousness
if
one
is
able
to
ascribe
them
to
others
for
more
on
this
theme
see
§

this
rules
out
cartesian
dualism
since
ascribing
states
of
consciousness
to
others
requires
that
one
be
able
to
identify
others
and
one
cannot
identify
pure
subjects
of
experience
or
cartesian
egos
the
condition
that
one
must
be
able
to
ascribe
states
of
consciousness
to
others
also
rules
out
the
“
noownership
view
”
because
such
a
view
is
inconsistent
with
the
fact
that
psychological
predicates
have
the
very
same
sense
in
their
first
and
third
person
uses
closely
related
to
the
noownership
view
are

family
of
claims
about
persons

prominent
members

the

the
occurrence
of

it
has
sometimes
been
argued
that
reductionism
is
incompatible
with

so
since
we
are
indisputably
selfconscious
reductionism
must
be
false
against
the
claim
that
the
continued

of
a

consists
merely
in
the
continued
existence
of

and
interrelated
physical

mental
events
that
do
not
presuppose
anything
about

such

for

argues
from
a
broadly
evansian
position
on
selfconsciousness
see

on

that
there
simply
are
no
such

a

could
be
reducible
that
is
there
is
no

of
characterising

and
the
other
psychological
phenomena
relevant
to
personal
identity
without
invoking
the
identity
of
the
person
whose
memory
it
is
as
mcdowell
puts
it
in
continuity
of
“
consciousness
”
there
is

to
be

that

that

with

concepts
might
be
simply
unaware
of

own
sensations

so
on
a
rational
creature
that
is

shoemaker
argues
will
typically
desire
to
be
rid
of
her
pain
and
this
requires
that
she
believe
that
she
is
in
pain
as
shoemaker
puts
it
to
see
rational
responses
to
pain
as
pain
behavior
is
to
see
them
as
motivated
by
such
states
of
the
creature
as
the
belief
that
it
is
in
pain
the
desire
to
be
rid
of
the
pain

belief
that

this

that

the
connection
between
rationality
and
selfknowledge
and
so
selfconsciousness
shoemaker
argues
is
even
more
pronounced
in
the
case
of
our
awareness
of
our
own
beliefs
rational
subjects
should
abide
by
certain
strictures
on
the
contents
of
their
beliefs
updating
them
in
line
with
new
evidence
removing
inconsistencies
and
so
on
and
this
shoemaker
argues
requires
that
they
not
be
selfblind
with
respect
to
their
beliefs
it
requires
that
they
are
selfconscious
as
shoemaker
writes
in
an
important
class
of
cases
the
rational
revision
or
adjustment
of
the
beliefdesire
system
requires
that
we
undertake
investigations

determining

burge
focuses
on
the
notion
of
the
critical
reasoner
he
writes
to
be
capable
of
critical
reasoning
and
to
be
subject
to
certain
rational
norms
necessarily
associated
with
such
reasoning
some
mental
acts
and
states
must
be
knowledgeably
reviewable

for
a
fuller
argument
for
the
same
conclusion
see
burge
1998
on
burge
s
account
the
critical
reasoner
must
be
in
a
position
to
recognise
their
reasons
as
reasons
and
that
requires
“
the
second
order
ability
to
think
about
thought
contents
or
propositions
and
rational
relations
among
them
”
1996
97
this
is
for
the
reason
that
belief
involves
commitments
and
such
commitments
involve
meeting
certain
standards
—
providing
reasons
reevaluating
where
necessary
and
so
on
a
similar
line
of
thought
can
be
found
in
moran
s
account
of
the
role
of
reflection
on

own
state
in
practical
deliberation

what
to
do
and

to

here
the
focus
is
not
so
much
on
critical
reasoning
but
rather
practical
deliberation
as
that
which
requires
selfconsciousness
this
is
an
idea
that
is
also
central
to
much
of
korsgaard
s
work
see
in
particular
korsgaard
1996
2009
a
central
concern
of
hers
is
to
distinguish
between
the
sort
of
action
of
which
all
animals
are
capable
and
the
sort
of
autonomous
agency
of
which
we
selfconscious
subjects
are
capable
the
difference
lies
on
her
broadly
kantian
view
in
simply
having
one
s
most
powerful
desire
result
in
action
on
the
one
hand
and
counting
that
desire
as
a
reason
for
action
on
the
other
it
is
the
latter
that
is
constitutive
of
autonomous
deliberative
action
understood
from
the
perspective
of
practical
reason
as
she
writes
when
you
deliberate
it
is
as
if
there
were
something
over
and
above
all
your
desires
something
which
is
you
and
which
chooses
which
desire
to
act

selfconsciousness
on
this
view
is
the
source
of
reason
when
we
become
conscious
of
the
workings
of
an
incentive
within
us
the
incentive
is
experienced
not
as
a
force
or
a
necessity
but
as
a
proposal

need

of

this
kantian
picture
is
associated
with
the
claim
that

selfconsciousness
requires
a
conception
of
the
world
as
objective
as
transcending
the
perspective
that
one
has
on

the
idea
here
is
that
to
selfascribe
an
experience
one
must
have
some
grasp
of
the
distinction
between
one

experience

the

selfconsciousness
can
be
criticised
in
a
number
of
different
ways
how
one
evaluates
the
claim
will
depend
on
whether
one
has
conceptual
or
nonconceptual
selfconsciousness
in
mind
as
bayne
2004
points
out
the
claim
that
the
unity
of
consciousness
requires
that
one
possess
the
concept
of
oneself
seems
implausibly
to
imply
that
conceptually
unsophisticated
infants
and
nonhuman
animals
could
not
possess
a
unified
stream
of
consciousness
of
course
this
worry
applies
quite
generally
to
views
that
connect
consciousness
with
selfconsciousness
the
view
that
nonconceptual
selfconsciousness
is
a
necessary
condition
of
the
unity
of
consciousness
would
appear
to
be
vulnerable
to
the
objection
that
it
implausibly
rules
out
the
possibility
of
cases
such
as
anscombe

a

tank
a
case
in
which
the

the

what
is
required
is
some
empirical
criterion
for
judging
a
creature
selfconscious
even
if
as
with
infants
and
nonhuman
animals
they
are
unable
to
provide
evidence
via
their
use
of
the
firstperson
pronoun
such
evidence
if
available
may
reasonably
be
thought
to
shed
light
on
both
the
phylogenetic
and
ontogenetic
development
of
selfconsciousness

mirror
recognition
it
has
sometimes
been
claimed
most
forcefully
by
gallup
and
colleagues
that
the
capacity
to
recognise
oneself
in
the
mirror
is
a
marker
of
selfconsciousness
gallup
1970

it
is
easy
to
see
why
this
might
seem
to
be
so
since
if
firstperson
thought
involves
thinking
about
oneself
as
oneself
then
it
is
natural
to
suppose
that
a
capacity
to
recognise
that
a
subject
seen
in
a
mirror
is
oneself
involves
such
a
thought
in
evans
s
1982
terminology
such
thoughts
involve
an
“
identification
component
”
gallup
1970
devised
a
test
for
mirror
selfrecognition
surreptitiously
placing
a
red
mark
on
a
subject
s
forehead
before
exposure
to
a
mirror
then
observing
whether
they
touch
the
relevant
spot
it
is
well
established
that
chimpanzees
pass
the
mirror
test
while
other
primate
species
fail
anderson
gallup
2011
it
has
also
been
claimed
that
dolphins
and
some
elephants
pass
the
test
reiss
marino
2001
plotnik
et
al
2006
with
respect
to
human
infants
the
consensus
is
that
success
in
the
mirror
test
begins
at
around
15
to
18
months
of
age
and
that
by
24
months
most
children
pass
amsterdam

lewis

1979
nielsen

2006
it
is
not
universally
accepted
however
that
success
in
the
mirror
test
is
an
indication
of
selfconsciousness
for
example
heyes
1994
presents
an
influential
critique
of
the
claim
that
it
is
a
marker
of
selfawareness
arguing
that
all
that
is
required
for
success
is
that
subjects
be
able
to
distinguish
between
novel
ways
of
receiving
bodily
feedback
in
order
to
guide
behaviour
on
the
one
hand
and
other
forms
of
incoming
sensory
data
on
the
other
such
a
view
however
needs
to
explain
why
it
is
that
passing
the
mirror
test
seems
to
be
connected
with
the
phenomena
arguably
associated
with
selfconsciousness
such
as
experiencing
shame
and
embarrassment
m
lewis
2011
there
remains
then
significant
controversy
concerning
what
success
in
the
mirror
test
really
shows
and
so
whether
it
can
shed
light
on
the
development
of
selfawareness

episodic
memory
another
potential
marker
of
selfconsciousness
is
episodic
memory
the
capacity
that
we
have
to
recollect
particular
episodes
from
our
own
past
experience
see
tulving
1983
michaelian
2016
entry
on
memory
as
tulving
describes
it
episodic
memory
involves
“
autonoesis
”
or
“
mental
timetravel
”
the
experience
of
transporting
oneself
in
time
which
also
has
a
future
oriented
dimension
in
expectation
planning
and
so
on
see
michaelian
klein
szpunar
2016
the
connection
between
memory
and
selfconsciousness
is
one
that
is
often
made
see
§
2
3
§
3
and
§
4
1
if
it
is
correct
that
episodic
memory
essentially
involves
a
form
of
selfconsciousness
and
we
are
able
to
test
for
the
presence
of
episodic
memory
in
nonlinguistic
infants
and
animals
then
we
have
a
way
of
detecting
the
presence
of
selfconscious
abilities
since
however
episodic
memory
is
not
the
only
form
of
selfconsciousness
the
lack
of
it
does
not
indicate
that
a
creature
is
not
selfaware
indeed
the
much
discussed
case
of
k
c
seems
to
be
one
in
which
due
to
an
accident
someone
has
lost
episodic
memory
but
appears
to
remain
otherwise
selfconscious
see
rosenbaum
et
al
2005
tulving
himself
argues
that
only
humans
possess
episodic
memory
and
only
when
they
reach
the
age
of
around
4
years
2005
also
see
suddendorf
corballis
2007
whilst
human
infants
and
nonhuman
animals
possess
nonepisodic
forms
of
memory
such
as
semantic
memory
remembering
that
such
and
such
is
the
case
they
lack
the
“
autonoetic
”
consciousness
of
themselves
projected
either
back
or
forwards
in
time
for
example
whilst
most
3
year
old
infants
can
remember
presented
information
most
are
unreliable
when
it
comes
to
the
question
of
how
they
know
—
did
they
see
it
hear
it
etc
gopnik
graf
1988
the
suggestion
here
is
that
the
development
of
the
reliable
capacity
to
report
how
they
know
some
fact
reflects
the
development
of
the
capacity
to
episodically
remember
the
learning
event
in
the
case
of
animals
perhaps
the
most
suggestive
evidence
of
episodic
memory
derives
from
work
on
scrubjays
who
can
retain
information
about
what
food
has
been
stored
where
it
was
stored
and
when
clayton
bussey
dickinson
2003
this
evidence
coheres
with
the
“
what
where
when
”
criterion
of
episodic
memory
originally
proposed
by
tulving
1972
it
is
however
widely
accepted
that
this
contentbased
account
of
episodic
memory
—
episodic
memory
is
memory
that
contains
information
about
what
happened
where
it
happened
and
when
—
is
inadequate
since
nonepisodic
semantic
memory
often
involves
the
retention
of
“
what
where
when
”
information
due
to
the
difficulties
in
finding
a
behavioural
test
for
“
autonoetic
”
consciousness
it
is
often
though
not
universally
claimed
that
there
is
no
compelling
evidence
for
episodic
memory
and
thus
this
particular
form
of
selfconsciousness
in
nonhuman
animals

metacognition
another
body
of
research
pertaining
to
the
question
of
selfconsciousness
in
infants
and
nonhuman
animals
is
the
work
on
metacognition
and
metamemory
the
term
“
metacognition
”
typically
refers
to
the
capacity
to
monitor
and
control
one
s
own
cognitive
states
and
is
manifest
in
one
s
judgements
or
feelings
concerning
one
s
own
learning
and
consequent
level
of
certainty
or
confidence
j
d
smith
2009
beran
et
al
2012
proust
2013
fleming
frith
2014
the
suggestion
is
that
if
a
creature
is
able
to
monitor
their
own
level
of
confidence
they
are
to
that
extent
selfconscious
one
common
paradigm
for
testing
metacognitive
abilities
involves
presenting
subjects
with
a
stimulus
that
they
must
categorise
in
one
of
two
ways
crucially
they
are
also
given
the
opportunity
to
opt
out
of
the
test
with
correct
categorisation
resulting
in
the
highest
reward
opting
out
resulting
in
a
lower
reward
and
incorrect
categorisation
resulting
in
no
reward
the
assumption
is
that
the
optout
response
reflects
a
metacognitive
judgement
of
uncertainty
evidence
gathered
from
such
a
paradigm
has
been
taken
to
show
metacognitive
abilities
in
some
birds
fujita

sodian
et
al
2012
the
view
that
success
on
metacognitive
optout
tests
is
indicative
of
selfconsciousness
is
not
uncontroversial
however
for
example
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
uncertainty
response
is
indicative
not
of
metacognitive
uncertainty
monitoring
but
rather
of
firstorder
environmental
judgements
concerning
a
third
category

on

an
interpretation
the

does
not
provide

evidence
regarding

in

animals
but
for
critical
discussion

is

”
and
“

accounts
of
metacognition
outlined
by

the
question
of
the
significance
of
optout
tests
for
attributions
of
selfconsciousness

a
portrait

drawn

1905
by
edvard
munch
friedrich
nietzsche
5
october

–

august

was
mostly
known
for
his
philosophy
from
reading
nietzsche
s
philosophy
though
one
can
sense
a
breadth
of
interests
language
history
poetry
culture
yet
something
consistent
connects
them
at
great
lengths
he
explores
the
psychology
of
existence
in
particular
he
was
interested
in
our
relationship
with
suffering
we
have
a
need
to
find
suffering
meaningful
nietzsche
thought
creating
purpose
in
a
continuous
process
of
interpretation
and
reinterpretation
thus
spoke
nietzsche
hehe
in
on
the
genealogy
of
morality
we
tend
to
live
under
creditordebtor
relationships
there
are
higher
creditors
god
society
etc
and
we
the
debtors
favour
the
foretaste
of
their
higher
status
in
these
relationships
we
feel
existential
guilt
e
g
from
sins
using
goods
and
services
etc
and
embrace
—
even
enjoy
—
the
suffering
e
g
through
punishment
discipline
tradition
sacrifice
sexual
deprivation
however
this
psychological
instinct
has
a
way
of
turning
itself
inward
the
internalizing
of
man
what
he
later
calls
his
soul
nietzsche
was
not
a
fan
such
maltreatment
belongs
to
desperate
prisoners
filled
with
longing
and
without
bodily
instinct
i
take
bad
conscience
to
be
the
deep
sickness
into
which
man
had
to
fall
under
the
pressure
of
the
most
fundamental
of
all
changes
he
ever
experienced
—
the
change
of
finding
himself
enclosed
once
and
for
all
within
the
sway
of
society
and
peace
just
as
water
animals
must
have
fared
when
they
were
forced
either
to
become
land
animals
or
to
perish
so
fared
these
half
animals
who
were
happily
adapted
to
wilderness
war
roaming
about
adventure
—
all
at
once
all
their
instincts
were
devalued
and
disconnected
in
nietzsche
s
nihilism
there
are
no
absolute
values
we
inherit
values
from
social
institutions
who
enforce
adherence
for
their
own
power
but
when
these
values
stop
servicing
our
lives
we
should
learn
as
individuals
to
renounce
those
collective
values
and
create
new
ones
which
service
us
once
more
nietzsche
s
worldview
continues
to
resonate
with
many
people
especially
the
angsty
go
ahead
and
see
type
nihilism
into
a
social
media
platform
s
search
bar
and
see
what
comes
up
however
there
is
no
doubt
that
nietzsche
constructed
a
lifeaffirming
philosophy
which
sought
to
elicit
individual
spirit

editorial
consciousness
by
rick
lewis
it
gives
me
particular
pleasure
to
introduce
an
issue
focussing
on
consciousness
as
i
myself
am
sometimes
conscious
i
know
the
same
goes
for
many
of
you
but
there
is
a
great
deal
of
debate
among
philosophers
about
what
this
actually
means
the
nature
of
consciousness
is
a
philosophical
problem
which
has
come
to
centre
stage
mainly
in
the
last
few
years
as
the
neuroscientists
have
gradually
found
out
more
and
more
about
the
workings
of
the
brain
philosophers
have
wondered
whether
any
part
of
the
mind
is
inaccessible
to
scientific
investigation
many
have
argued
that
even
if
we
find
out
everything
about
the
way
the
brain
physically
functions
there
will
still
be
something
vital
missing
from
our
picture
what
this
is
of
course
is
an
understanding
of
how
our
subjective
experiences
come
about
this
is
what
david
chalmers
calls
the
hard
problem
of
consciousness
in
this
issue
we
have
articles
looking
at
this
problem
from
a
wide
variety
of
viewpoints
in
the
first
of
them
mary
midgley
says
that
many
people
talk
about
consciousness
as
if
the
brain
was
in
isolation
she
says
we
need
to
step
back
and
see
consciousness
in
its
wider
context
which
is
the
context
of
organic
life
if
conscious
life
had
to
be
organic
this
would
rule
out
the
possibility
of
conscious
machines
professor
igor
aleksander
see
interview
is
an
expert
on
artificial
intelligence
he
at
least
thinks
that
it
is
possible
to
build
robots
which
are
conscious
of
their
surroundings
in
a
sense
broadly
similar
to
the
sense
in
which
we
say
that
humans
are
aware
of
their
surroundings
he
aims
to
prove
this
by
actually
building
one
and
has
already
made
some
progress
in
that
direction
there
is
a
huge
contrast
between
igor
aleksander
s
view
and
that
of
the
french
philosopher
henri
bergson
18591941
bergson
was
a
towering
figure
in
french
philosophy
in
the
early
20th
century
–
the
jacques
derrida
of
his
day
however
he
has
gone
into
a
profound
eclipse
reading
johnfrancis
phipps
article
about
him
it
isn
t
hard
to
see
why
–
there
can
be
few
philosophers
less
in
tune
with
the
intellectual
spirit
of
the
early
21st
century
than
our
henri
still
for
that
very
reason
his
ideas
on
consciousness
give
a
completely
different
perspective
on
the
subject
from
that
to
which
we
re
now
accustomed
some
people
approach
the
problem
by
pointing
out
that
consciousness
is
always
consciousness
of
something
i
was
conscious
of
the
gathering
clouds
you
were
conscious
of
the
rain
falling
on
your
face
so
they
say
consciousness
is
always
directed
towards
something
it
has
aboutness
or
in
philojargon
intentionality
this
isn
t
the
only
way
we
talk
about
consciousness
in
everyday
speech
however
as
jeanne
warren
points
out
in
her
article
on
john
macmurray
we
also
use
it
to
mean
the
opposite
of
unconsciousness
–
of
being
asleep
or
in
a
coma
there
isn
t
necessarily
any
huge
divergence
of
meaning
here
as
when
we
say
“
has
fred
regained
consciousness
”
we
might
be
asking
whether
he
has
become
aware
again
of
all
the
various
things
and
people
around
him
though
the
theme
of
this
issue
is
consciousness
a
second
unanticipated
theme
seems
to
have
crept
in
as
well
with
articles
on
henri
bergson
john
macmurray
and
john
herschel
we
have
pieces
on
three
thinkers
who
are
regarded
by
some
as
being
unjustly
neglected
bergson
and
herschel
were
acclaimed
as
giants
in
their
own
day
macmurray
wasn
t
but
has
gradually
gathered
admirers
in
the
years
since
his
demise
from
one
of
the
most
conceptually
difficult
problems
of
philosophy
we
turn
to
one
of
the
most
practically
worrying
ethical
issue
of
today
the
headlines
have
been
filled
recently
by
the
misdeeds
of
soldiers
stationed
in
iraq
–
the
torture
of
prisoners
the
deaths
of
civilians
in
the
first
article
in
this
issue
philosophy
graduate
douglas
gearhart
who
served
as
a
psyops
psychological
operations
specialist
in
iraq
appeals
to
philosophers
to
develop
practical
moral
guidance
and
moral
training
for
soldiers
in
battlefield
situations
scholastic
philosophers
like
thomas
aquinas
called
this
aspect
of
just
war
theory
jus
in
bello
if
gearhart
is
right
it
should
cease
being
seen
as
a
quaint
relic
of
medieval
thought
and
instead
become
the
urgent
concern
of
ethicists
everywhere
in
a
way
this
is
also
about
consciousness
as
the
choices
soldiers
make
in
wars
are
conscious
choices
but
ones
made
under
enormous
stress
and
without
the
steadying
framework
of
everyday
civilian
life
how
can
they
recall
more
easily
in
such
situations
a
conscious
awareness
of
the
dignity
and
fragility
of
human
life

article
summary
philosophers
have
used
the
term
consciousness
for
four
main
topics
knowledge
in
general
intentionality
introspection
and
the
knowledge
it
specifically
generates
and
phenomenal
experience
this
entry
discusses
the
last
two
uses
something
within
one
s
mind
is
introspectively
conscious
just
in
case
one
introspects
it
or
is
poised
to
do
so
introspection
is
often
thought
to
deliver
one
s
primary
knowledge
of
one
s
mental
life
an
experience
or
other
mental
entity
is
phenomenally
conscious
just
in
case
there
is
something
it
is
like
for
one
to
have
it
the
clearest
examples
are
perceptual
experiences
such
as
tastings
and
seeings
bodilysensational
experiences
such
as
those
of
pains
tickles
and
itches
imaginative
experiences
such
as
those
of
one
s
own
actions
or
perceptions
and
streams
of
thought
as
in
the
experience
of
thinking
in
words
or
in
images
introspection
and
phenomenality
seem
independent
or
dissociable
although
this
is
controversial
phenomenally
conscious
experiences
have
been
argued
to
be
nonphysical
or
at
least
inexplicable
in
the
manner
of
other
physical
entities
several
such
arguments
allege
that
phenomenal
experience
is
subjective
that
understanding
some
experiences
requires
undergoing
them
or
their
components
the
claim
is
that
any
objective
physical
science
would
leave
an
explanatory
gap
failing
to
describe
what
it
is
like
to
have
a
particular
experience
and
failing
to
explain
why
there
are
phenomenal
experiences
at
all
from
this
some
philosophers
infer
dualism
rather
than
physicalism
about
consciousness
concluding
that
some
facts
about
consciousness
are
not
wholly
constituted
by
physical
facts
this
dualist
conclusion
threatens
claims
that
phenomenal
consciousness
has
causal
power
and
that
it
is
knowable
in
others
and
in
oneself
in
reaction
surprisingly
much
can
be
said
in
favour
of
eliminativism
about
phenomenal
consciousness
the
denial
of
any
realm
of
phenomenal
objects
and
properties
of
experience
most
but
not
all
philosophers
deny
that
there
are
phenomenal
objects
–
mental
images
with
colour
and
shape
painobjects
that
throb
or
burn
inner
speech
with
pitch
and
rhythm
and
so
on
instead
experiences
may
simply
seem
to
involve
such
objects
the
central
disagreement
concerns
whether
these
experiences
have
phenomenal
properties
–
qualia
particular
aspects
of
what
experiences
are
like
for
their
bearers
some
philosophers
deny
that
there
are
phenomenal
properties
–
especially
if
these
are
thought
to
be
intrinsic
completely
and
immediately
introspectible
ineffable
subjective
or
otherwise
potentially
difficult
to
explain
on
physicalist
theories
more
commonly
philosophers
acknowledge
qualia
of
experiences
either
articulating
less
bold
conceptions
of
qualia
or
defending
dualism
about
boldly
conceived
qualia
introspective
consciousness
has
seemed
less
puzzling
than
phenomenal
consciousness
most
thinkers
agree
that
introspection
is
far
from
complete
about
the
mind
and
far
from
infallible
perhaps
the
most
familiar
account
of
introspection
is
that
in
addition
to
outwardly
perceiving
nonmental
entities
in
one
s
environment
and
body
one
inwardly
perceives
one
s
mental
entities
as
when
one
seems
to
see
visual
images
with
one
s
mind
s
eye
this
view
faces
several
serious
objections
rival
views
of
introspective
consciousness
fall
into
three
categories
according
to
whether
they
treat
introspective
access
1
as
epistemically
looser
or
less
direct
than
inner
perception
2
as
tighter
or
more
direct
or
3
as
fundamentally
nonepistemic
or
nonrepresentational
theories
in
category
1
explain
introspection
as
always
retrospective
or
as
typically
based
on
selfdirected
theoretical
inferences
rivals
from
category
2
maintain
that
an
introspectively
conscious
mental
state
reflexively
represents
itself
or
treat
introspection
as
involving
no
mechanism
of
access
at
all
category
3
theories
treat
a
mental
state
as
introspectively
conscious
if
it
is
distinctively
available
for
linguistic
or
rational
processing
even
if
it
is
not
itself

class
consciousness
and
false
consciousness
are
concepts
introduced
by
karl
marx
that
were
later
expanded
by
social
theorists
who
came
after
him
marx
wrote
about
the
theory
in
his
book
capital
volume
1
and
again
with
his
frequent
collaborator
friedrich
engels
in
the
impassioned
treatise
manifesto
of
the
communist
party
class
consciousness
refers
to
the
awareness
by
a
social
or
economic
class
of
their
position
and
interests
within
the
structure
of
the
economic
order
and
social
system
in
which
they
live
in
contrast
false
consciousness
is
a
perception
of
one
s
relationships
to
social
and
economic
systems
of
an
individual
nature
and
a
failure
to
see
oneself
as
a
part
of
a
class
with
particular
class
interests
relative
to
the
economic
order
and
social
system
marx
s
theory
of
class
consciousness
according
to
marxist
theory
class
consciousness
is
an
awareness
of
one
s
social
andor
economic
class
relative
to
others
as
well
as
an
understanding
of
the
economic
rank
of
the
class
to
which
you
belong
in
the
context
of
the
larger
society
in
addition
class
consciousness
involves
an
understanding
of
the
defining
social
and
economic
characteristics
and
collective
interests
of
your
own
class
within
the
constructs
of
the
given
socioeconomic
and
political
order
class
consciousness
is
a
core
facet
of
marx
s
theory
of
class
conflict
which
focuses
on
the
social
economic
and
political
relationships
between
workers
and
owners
within
a
capitalist
economy
the
precept
was
developed
in
conjunction
with
his
theory
on
how
workers
might
overthrow
the
system
of
capitalism
and
then
go
on
to
create
a
new
economic
social
and
political
system
based
on
equality
rather
than
inequality
and
exploitation
the
proletariat
vs
the
bourgeoisie
marx
believed
that
the
capitalist
system
was
rooted
in
class
conflict
—
specifically
the
economic
exploitation
of
the
proletariat
workers
by
the
bourgeoisie
those
who
owned
and
controlled
production
he
reasoned
that
the
system
only
functioned
as
long
as
the
workers
did
not
recognize
their
unity
as
a
class
of
laborers
their
shared
economic
and
political
interests
and
the
power
inherent
in
their
numbers
marx
argued
that
when
workers
came
to
understand
the
totality
of
these
factors
they
would
achieve
class
consciousness
and
this
in
turn
would
lead
to
a
workers
revolution
that
would
overthrow
the
exploitative
system
of
capitalism
hungarian
social
theorist
georg
lukács
who
followed
in
the
tradition
of
marxist
theory
expanded
the
concept
by
saying
that
class
consciousness
is
an
achievement
that
opposes
individual
consciousness
and
results
from
the
group
struggle
to
see
the
totality
of
social
and
economic
systems
the
problem
of
false
consciousness
according
to
marx
before
workers
developed
a
class
consciousness
they
were
actually
living
with
a
false
consciousness
though
marx
never
used
the
actual
term
he
did
develop
the
ideas
that
it
encompasses
in
essence
false
consciousness
is
the
opposite
of
class
consciousness
individualistic
rather
than
collective
in
nature
it
produces
a
view
of
oneself
as
a
single
entity
engaged
in
competition
with
others
of
one
s
social
and
economic
standing
rather
than
as
part
of
a
group
with
unified
experiences
struggles
and
interests
according
to
marx
and
other
social
theorists
who
followed
false
consciousness
was
dangerous
because
it
encouraged
people
to
think
and
act
in
ways
that
were
counterintuitive
to
their
economic
social
and
political
selfinterests
marx
saw
false
consciousness
as
a
product
of
an
unequal
social
system
controlled
by
a
powerful
minority
of
elites
the
false
consciousness
among
workers
which
prevented
them
from
seeing
their
collective
interests
and
power
was
created
by
the
material
relations
and
conditions
of
the
capitalist
system
by
the
ideology
the
dominant
worldview
and
values
of
those
who
control
the
system
and
by
social
institutions
and
how
they
function
in
society
marx
cited
the
phenomenon
of
commodity
fetishism
—
the
way
capitalist
production
frames
relationships
between
people
workers
and
owners
as
relationships
between
things
money
and
products
—
with
playing
a
key
role
in
producing
false
consciousness
among
workers
he
believed
that
commodity
fetishism
served
to
obscure
the
fact
that
relations
with
regard
to
production
within
a
capitalist
system
are
actually
relationships
between
people
and
that
as
such
they
are
changeable
building
on
marx
s
theory
italian
scholar
writer
and
activist
antonio
gramsci
expanded
the
ideological
component
of
false
consciousness
by
arguing
that
a
process
of
cultural
hegemony
guided
by
those
holding
economic
social
and
cultural
power
in
society
produced
a
common
sense
way
of
thinking
that
embued
the
status
quo
with
legitimacy
gramsci
noted
that
by
believing
in
the
common
sense
of
one
s
age
a
person
actually
consents
to
the
conditions
of
exploitation
and
domination
that
one
experiences
this
common
sense
—
the
ideology
that
produces
false
consciousness
—
is
actually
a
misrepresentation
and
misunderstanding
of
the
social
relationships
that
define
the
economic
social
and
political
systems
false
consciousness
in
a
stratified
society
an
example
of
how
cultural
hegemony
works
to
produce
false
consciousness
—
that
is
true
both
historically
and
today
—
is
the
belief
that
upward
mobility
is
possible
for
all
people
regardless
of
the
circumstances
of
their
birth
as
long
as
they
choose
to
dedicate
themselves
to
education
training
and
hard
work
in
the
u
s
this
belief
is
encapsulated
in
the
ideal
of
the
american
dream
viewing
society
and
one
s
place
within
it
based
on
the
set
of
assumptions
derived
from
common
sense
thinking
results
in
a
perception
of
being
an
individual
rather
than
part
of
a
collective
economic
success
and
failure
rest
squarely
on
the
shoulders
of
the
individual
and
do
not
take
into
account
the
totality
of
the
social
economic
and
political
systems
that
shape
our
lives
at
the
time
marx
was
writing
about
class
consciousness
he
perceived
class
as
the
relationship
of
people
to
the
means
of
production
—
the
owners
versus
the
workers
while
the
model
is
still
useful
we
can
also
think
about
the
economic
stratification
of
our
society
into
different
classes
based
on
income
occupation
and
social
status
decades
worth
of
demographic
data
reveals
that
the
american
dream
and
its
promise
of
upward
mobility
is
largely
a
myth
in
truth
the
economic
class
a
person
is
born
into
is
the
primary
determinant
of
how
he
or
she
will
fair
economically
as
an
adult
however
as
long
as
a
person
believes
the
myth
he
or
she
will
continue
to
live
and
operate
with
a
false
consciousness
without
a
class
consciousness
they
will
fail
to
recognize
that
the
stratified
economic
system
in
which
they
re
operating
was
designed
to
afford
only
the
bare
minimum
of
money
to
workers
while
funneling
huge
profits
to
the
owners

false
consciousness
is
a
term
used
to
describe
the
way
in
which
exploited
oppressed
or
disadvantaged
groups
in
society
accept
assimilate
and
indeed
actively
defend
or
promote
ideas
which
ultimately
act
against
their
own
interests
 
it
can
apply
to
individuals
to
the
working
class
as
a
whole
or
to
sections
of
it
 
it
is
closely
related
to
the
idea
of
hegemony
see
qa
82
and
to
marxist
concepts
of
alienation
reification
and
fetishism
see

“
false
consciousness
”
 
often
manifests
itself
as
socalled
“
common
sense
”
 
examples
include
the
notion
that
capitalism
“
private
enterprise
”
profit
“
the
market
”
 
is
simply
how
things
are
 
that
those
who
have
power
or
earn
more
do
so
because
they
are
brighter
or
work
harder
than
the
rest
of
us
that
differences
in
opportunity
or
in
the
social
position
of
men
and
women
are
natural
determined
by
their
genes
that
the
status
quo
is
simply
just
“
the
way
the
world
works
”
 
and
can
t
be
changed
 
false
consciousness
is
related
to
the
ever
changing
economic
and
social
base
of
capitalism
marx
and
engels
declared
“
the
ideas
of
the
ruling
class
are
in
every
epoch
the
ruling
ideas
ie
 
the
class
which
is
the
ruling
material
force
of
society
is
at
the
same
time
its
ruling
intellectual
force
“
the
class
which
has
the
means
of
material
production
at
its
disposal
has
control
at
the
same
time
over
the
means
of
mental
production
so
that
thereby
generally
speaking
the
ideas
of
those
who
lack
the
means
of
mental
production
are
subject
to
it
the
ruling
ideas
are
nothing
more
than
the
ideal
expression
of
the
dominant
material
relationships
the
dominant
material
relationships
grasped
as
ideas
hence
of
the
relationships
which
make
the
one
class
the
ruling
one
therefore
the
ideas
of
its
dominance
”
marx
and
engels
argued
that
false
consciousness
applies
particularly
in
regard
to
abstract
ideas
such
as
property
rights
 
“
ie
 
ideas
which
increasingly
take
on
the
form
of
universality
for
each
new
class
which
puts
itself
in
the
place
of
one
ruling
before
it
is
compelled
merely
in
order
to
carry
through
its
aim
to
represent
its
interest
as
the
common
interest
of
all
the
members
of
society
that
is
expressed
in
ideal
form
it
has
to
give
its
ideas
the
form
of
universality
and
represent
them
as
the
only
rational
universally
valid
ones
”
 
the
term
“
false
consciousness
”
 
was
first
used
by
engels
who
emphasised
that
it
was
not
simply
a
passive
absorption
of
rulingclass
ideas
and
values
but
involves
an
active
acquiescence
in
adopting
and
developing
those
ideas
“
a
process
accomplished
by
the
socalled
thinker
consciously
indeed
but
with
a
false
consciousness
”
 
false
consciousness
was
an
aspect
of
ideology
but
engels
declared
had
been
neglected
by
marxists
because
of
“
the
fatuous
notion
of
the
ideologists
that
because
we
deny
an
independent
historical
development
to
the
various
ideological
spheres
which
play
a
part
in
history
we
also
deny
them
any
effect
upon
history
”
 
gramsci
in
the
1930s
further
developed
the
notion
of
false
consciousness
as
part
of
the
political
superstructure
as
a
vehicle
for
delivering
capitalist
hegemony
–
the
dominant
but
changing
set
of
cultural
and
ideological
norms
which
determine
the
boundaries
of
what
can
and
cannot
be
said
without
inviting
ridicule
or
antagonism
and
which
helps
the
existing
system
to
address
its
own
contradictions
adapt
and
survive
 
false
consciousness
is
in
part
a
consequence
of
the
hegemony
of
propaganda
of
the
institutions
of
the
capitalist
state
including
education
and
the
media
which
encourages
and
for
some
individuals
rewards
obedience
submission
and
conformity
 
but
it
manifests
itself
–
and
is
reinforced
–
 
in
multiple
ways
in
everyday
life
 
it
expresses
itself
for
example
in
commodity
fetishism
—
the
way
relationships
between
people
workers
and
owners
are
framed
as
relationships
between
things
money
and
products
commodity
fetishism
obscures
the
fact
that
relations
between
people
and
products
reflect
relationships
between
people
and
that
they
can
therefore
be
changed
 
false
consciousness
reveals
itself
above
all
in
conformity
–
how
the
need
to
keep
a
job
to
pay
the
rent
or
mortgage
feed
the
kids
heat
the
home
enjoy
the
occasional
luxury
becomes
seen
as
normal
the
natural
state
of
affairs
whilst
those
who
reap
the
rewards
of
your
labour
are
simply
enjoying
the
rights
of
ownership
ultimately
false
consciousness
legitimates
the
power
of
the
ruling
class
 
marx
and
engels
declared
 
“
in
the
last
analysis
the
dominant
ideas
of
a
society
are
the
ideas
of
its
ruling
class
”
–
legitimating
a
situation
in
which
one
class
has
power
 
as
terry
eagleton
puts
it
ideology
is
“
an
element
in
that
complex
structure
of
social
perception
which
ensures
that
the
situation
in
which
one
social
class
has
power
over
the
others
is
either
seen
by
most
members
of
the
society
as
natural
or
not
seen
at
all
”
 
 
but
especially
in
its
cultural
aspects
“
ideology
is
never
a
simple
reflection
of
a
ruling
class
s
ideas
on
the
contrary
it
is
always
a
complex
phenomenon
which
may
incorporate
conflicting
even
contradictory
views
of
the
world
”
engels
for
example
 
declared
that
art
is
far
richer
and
more
“
opaque
”
 
than
political
and
economic
theory
because
it
is
less
explicit
less
purely
ideological
 
so
challenging
false
consciousness
is
not
just
a
matter
of
political
education
and
social
argument
 
as
the
excellent
culture
pages
in
this
paper
show
the
battle
is
also
important
in
the
cultural
sphere
 
the
literary
critic
ernst
fischer
declared
that
art
can
and
that
good
art
always
does
transcend
the
ideological
limits
of
its
time
“
yielding
us
insights
into
the
realities
”
false
consciousness
is
the
antithesis
of
class
consciousness
of
the
development
of
a
“
class
for
itself
”
class
consciousness
involves
forging
a
counterculture
which
sees
beyond
the
limitations
of
capitalism
 
that
task
is
vital
where
the
contradictions
of
capitalism
are
most
apparent
–
in
the
workplace
in
our
transport
or
energy
supply
systems
in
the
food
chain
in
the
climate
crisis
 
but
it
is
critical
also
in
neighbourhoods
in
communities
in
everyday
life
 
in
the
decades
following
the
collapse
of
“
existing
socialism
”
 
in
the
soviet
union
and
subsequently
elsewhere
not
least
for
example
in
yugoslavia
which
had
a
very
different
model
of
social
organisation
and
political
engagement
some
on
the
left
experienced
selfdoubt
 
some
even
conceived
that
capitalism
represented
“
the
end
of
history
”
 
–
that
selfinterest
and
exploitation
was
the
inevitable
state
of
humanity
 
but
socialism
survived
–
and
survives
–
 
not
least
in
cuba
in
perhaps
the
least
 
propitious
of
circumstances
due
to
the
consciousness
and
engagement
of
workers
and
communities
in
protecting
the
gains
of
their
revolution
and
socialist
ideas
continue
 
to
inspire
struggles
for
social
justice
and
progress
throughout
the
world
 
in
britain
too
resistance
to
capitalism
s
escalating
economic
crisis
and
public
support
for
struggles
over
jobs
pay
conditions
and
the
social
wage
reflects
a
growing
understanding
that
things
can
and
must
change
central
to
marx
s
concept
of
historical
materialism
is
the
understanding
that
it
is
not
consciousness
that
determines
people
s
existence
but
their
social
existence
that
determines
their
consciousness
 
however
the
form
that
consciousness
takes
can
vary
 
as
gawain
little
pointed
out
in
an
article
in
this
paper
the
hegemony
exercised
by
capital
is
in
a
constant
process
of
being
remade
and
reconfigured
 
as
he
argued
“
it
is
not
enough
to
propose
alternatives
or
even
to
fight
to
win
people
to
them
we
must
change
the
very
common
sense
 
of
society
enabling
people
to
envision
a
future
beyond
capitalism
”
 
that
is
probably
the
single
biggest
challenge
facing
all
socialists

this
post
is
part
i
of
a
series
the
field
of
consciousness
studies
has
come
of
age
prior
to
the
1990s
theories
of
consciousness
were
more
of
a
philosophical
pursuit
than
a
serious
scientific
one
this
was
largely
because
scientists
considered
the
domain
of
subjective
experience
—
which
is
what
consciousness
fundamentally
is
—
to
be
well
too
subjective
it
just
didn
t
seem
amenable
to
objective
empirical
study
using
the
scientific
method
and
the
whole
concept
of
consciousness
was
considered
too
slippery
and
vague
quicksand
even
now
in
my
own
very
practicallyoriented
clinical
field
of
psychiatry
—
one
which
relies
heavily
on
subjective
selfreport
by
patients
—
when
i
talk
with
colleagues
about
my
interest
in
the
science
of
consciousness
and
tell
them
about
the
scientific
conferences
focused
on
it
which
i
like
to
attend
i
am
met
with
comments
such
as
this
one
from
a
recent
email
exchange
“
you
brave
brave
man
you
—
willing
to
wade
into
the
bottomless
pit
of
quicksand
that
is
consciousness
studies
i
run
screaming
in
the
opposite
direction
”
my
response
to
this
quip
was
to
point
out
that
a
quick
glance
at
the
program
of
the
particular
conference
i
had
just
returned
from
would
attest
to
the
fact
that
this
field
has
matured
into
a
rigorous
and
rapidly
developing
sphere
of
neuroscience
with
considerably
less
quicksand
than
before
an
additional
criticism
could
legitimately
be
that
the
topic
of
consciousness
has
attracted
a
huge
number
of
mystical
woo
practitioners
but
even
if
99
percent
of
the
field
were
comprised
of
pseudoscience
this
conference
and
the
large
vibrant
scientific
community
it
represents
would
certainly
be
the
other
1
percent
the
hard
problem
inevitably
attempts
to
scientifically
explain
consciousness
run
up
against
the
“
explanatory
gap
”
or
what
is
called
the
“
hard
problem
”
of
consciousness
—
the
problem
of
subjective
experience
why
it
feels
like
something
to
be
conscious
¹
or
as
the
philosopher
thomas
nagel
famously
formulated
it
“
something
that
it
is
like
to
be
”
²
the
socalled
“
easy
problems
”
concern
questions
like
how
the
brain
processes
information
how
different
sensory
inputs
are
integrated
how
memories
are
formed
and
how
we
can
selectively
focus
our
attention
they
are
“
easy
”
relative
to
the
hard
problem
in
that
they
are
more
scientifically
tractable
correlates
vs
explanations
in
the
early
decades
of
the
revival
of
scientific
interest
in
studying
consciousness
research
focused
on
identifying
the
“
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
”
nccs
which
are
the
essential
neural
events
needed
to
produce
conscious
states
that
search
concentrated
on
brain
states
closely
tied
to
consciousness
over
time
more
attention
has
been
directed
toward
developing
theories
of
consciousness
tocs
while
the
ncc
approach
looks
for
correlations
between
brain
activity
and
consciousness
tocs
seek
explanatory
links
between
neural
mechanisms
and
aspects
of
consciousness
a
proliferation
of
theories
presently
we
are
still
at
a
relatively
early
stage
in
the
scientific
study
of
consciousness
at
this
point
there
are
a
great
many
theories
of
consciousness
proliferating
and
competing
with
each
other
those
theories
sometimes
seem
to
talk
past
each
other
as
they
explore
vastly
different
approaches
to
the
problem
attempting
to
understand
the
various
tocs
and
how
they
contrast
with
one
another
can
be
quite
overwhelming
even
for
those
with
a
good
deal
of
familiarity
with
the
field
in
recent
years
there
have
been
a
number
of
academic
papers
attempting
to
catalogue
and
compare
the
various
theories
³
still
for
the
general
reader
it
can
all
be
quite
confusing
and
impenetrable
this
fivepart
blog
series
will
attempt
to
make
some
of
the
major
theories
more
accessible
to
a
general
educated
readership
only
a
few
major
theories
will
be
covered
here
several
others
have
already
been
previously
covered
in
my
other
blog
posts
⁴
four
leading
contenders
among
the
most
helpful
recent
academic
journal
articles
comparing
different
theories
of
consciousness
is
a
2022
paper
by
anil
seth
and
tim
bayne
⁵
seth
and
bayne
focus
their
review
mainly
on
the
following
four
prominent
theoretical
approaches
to
consciousness
i
will
briefly
summarize
these
here
in
simple
terms
1
higherorder
theories
hots
these
theories
propose
that
thoughts
become
conscious
when
basic
perceptions
“
lowerorder
”
representations
become
rerepresented
as
higherorder
representations
at
higher
levels
of
the
brain
specifically
in
the
prefrontal
cortex
2
global
workspace
theories
gwts
according
to
these
theories
perceptions
thoughts
emotions
etc
become
conscious
when
they
gain
access
to
a
“
workspace
”
or
to
apply
another
analogy
when
they
make
it
into
the
“
spotlight
”
—
as
if
the
mind
were
a
theater
where
conscious
thought
is
the
activity
in
the
spotlight
on
the
stage
at
a
given
moment
except
that
unlike
in
the
analogy
the
actual
workspace
in
the
brain
is
not
localized
but
rather
is
distributed
across
the
frontal
and
parietal
regions
of
the
cortex
according
to
the
theory
3
integrated
information
theory
iit
this
theory
is
about
how
parts
of
a
brain
interact
to
create
a
unified
experience
consciousness
is
theorized
to
be
related
to
how
much
information
is
integrated
among
the
different
parts
of
the
brain
iit
tries
to
mathematically
measure
this
the
more
information
that
is
connected
and
integrated
the
more
conscious
the
system
is
thought
to
be
the
theory
suggests
that
not
just
brains
but
any
complex
system
with
the
right
level
of
interconnectedness
and
integration
of
information
could
exhibit
consciousness
with
simpler
systems
manifesting
only
an
insignificant
modicum
of
consciousness
iit
attempts
to
explain
the
quality
of
conscious
experience
suggesting
that
the
unique
pattern
of
relationships
between
the
elements
of
the
system
is
what
defines
a
particular
conscious
experience
4
reentry
and
predictive
processing
theories
the
core
claim
of
reentry
theory
and
predictive
processing
is
that
conscious
mental
states
are
associated
with
topdown
signaling
topdown
signaling
refers
to
the
process
by
which
higherlevel
brain
regions
send
information
expectations
or
context
to
lowerlevel
brain
regions
this
communication
helps
shape
how
the
brain
perceives
and
interprets
bottomup
information
received
via
its
sense
organs
from
the
world
around
it
predictive
processing
theories
are
not
specifically
theories
of
consciousness
but
are
more
general
accounts
of
brain
function
that
can
be
used
to
formulate
ideas
about
the
properties
of
consciousness
philosophy
essential
reads
a
guide
to
navigating
life
s
complexities
what
happened
to
the
stratification
view
of
nature
other
strong
contenders
besides
the
above
four
categories
of
theories
seth
and
bayne
also
acknowledge
other
welldeveloped
approaches
to
consciousness
—
ones
that
involve
attention
learning
and
affect
theoretical
approaches
focused
on
attention
attention
schema
theory
ast
this
is
discussed
in
my
post
“
is
consciousness
an
illusion
”
theoretical
approaches
focused
on
learning
unlimited
associative
learning
ual
this
is
discussed
in
my
post
“
learning
may
be
the
key
to
the
evolution
of
consciousness
”
ual
arguably
has
the
strongest
evolutionary
grounding
of
all
the
theories
⁶
other
learningbased
theories
overlap
with
some
theories
described
under
the
four
main
sets
of
theories
listed
above
such
as
axel
cleeremans
version
of
higherorder
theory
hot
and
victor
lamme
s
local
recurrency
account
⁷
learningbased
theories
are
also
closely
related
to
“
selectionist
”
approaches
which
ground
consciousness
in
evolutionarylike
dynamics
within
and
between
neuronal
populations
referring
to
gerald
edelman
s
neural
darwinism
theory
⁸
affectbased
theories
damasio
s
“
self
comes
to
mind
”
theory
according
to
this
theory
consciousness
depends
on
interactions
between
homeostatic
routines
and
multilevel
interoceptive
maps
with
affect
and
feeling
at
the
core
⁹
this
is
discussed
in
my
posts
“
are
we
all
zombies
”
and
“
the
brain
as
a
prediction
machine
the
key
to
the
self
”
some
proposals
mix
an
affectbased
emphasis
with
predictive
processing
to
ground
conscious
experiences
in
controloriented
interoceptive
predictions
this
refers
to
the
way
the
brain
controls
the
body
s
internal
organs
and
physiological
parameters
by
making
predictions
about
what
they
should
be
for
example
the
brain
predicts
what
the
body
s
blood
glucose
level
should
be
and
then
sends
signals
to
adjust
that
state
if
it
deviates
from
predictions
anil
seth
s
“
beast
machine
”
theory
—
discussed
in
my
posts
“
the
brain
as
a
prediction
machine
the
key
to
consciousness
”
and
“
the
key
to
the
self
”
and
lisa
feldman
barrett
s
theory
¹
⁰
some
affectbased
theories
consider
cortical
mechanisms
to
be
unnecessary
for
consciousness
suggesting
instead
that
the
mechanisms
of
consciousness
are
located
in
the
brainstem

theories
of
mark
solms

and
bjorn
merker

²
in
future
parts
of
this
blog
series
we
will
discuss
hots
gwts
iit
reentry
and
predictive
processing
theories
following
which
we
will
be
in
a
better
position
to
judge
whether
the
field
is
any
closer
to
solving
the
“
hard
problem
”
of
consciousness
or
whether
there
really
is
such
a
problem
at
all
references
1
the
subjective
quality
of
a
conscious
experience
is
also
referred
to
as
“
qualia
”
–
for
example
the
redness
of
red
is
the
experience
of
seeing
redness
the
same
for
you
as
for
me
we
assume
it
is
but
there
s
no
really
objective
way
to
tell
and
why
and
how
should
the
visual
experience
even
have
this
“
redness
”
quality
at
all
as
the
product
of
electrical
and
chemical
signals
reverberating
in
our
physical
brains
the
answers
to
these
questions
are
not
selfevident

nagel
stated
“
an
organism
has
conscious
mental
states
if
and
only
if
there
is
something
that

according

consciousness
depends
on
reentrant
interactions
reflecting
a

events
shaped

the
term
interoceptive

perception
of

signals
that
originate
from
within
the
body
especially
in
the

abstract
recent
years
have
seen
a
blossoming
of
theories
about
the
biological
and
physical
basis
of
consciousness
good
theories
guide
empirical
research
allowing
us
to
interpret
data
develop
new
experimental
techniques
and
expand
our
capacity
to
manipulate
the
phenomenon
of
interest
indeed
it
is
only
when
couched
in
terms
of
a
theory
that
empirical
discoveries
can
ultimately
deliver
a
satisfying
understanding
of
a
phenomenon
however
in
the
case
of
consciousness
it
is
unclear
how
current
theories
relate
to
each
other
or
whether
they
can
be
empirically
distinguished
to
clarify
this
complicated
landscape
we
review
four
prominent
theoretical
approaches
to
consciousness
higherorder
theories
global
workspace
theories
reentry
and
predictive
processing
theories
and
integrated
information
theory
we
describe
the
key
characteristics
of
each
approach
by
identifying
which
aspects
of
consciousness
they
propose
to
explain
what
their
neurobiological
commitments
are
and
what
empirical
data
are
adduced
in
their
support
we
consider
how
some
prominent
empirical
debates
might
distinguish
among
these
theories
and
we
outline
three
ways
in
which
theories
need
to
be
developed
to
deliver
a
mature
regimen
of
theorytesting
in
the
neuroscience
of
consciousness
there
are
good
reasons
to
think
that
the
iterative
development
testing
and
comparison
of
theories
of
consciousness
will
lead
to
a
deeper
understanding
of
this
most
profound
of
mysteries

what

what
are
the
four
main
theories
of
consciousness
shutterstock
agsandrew
in
the
early
days
of
modern
consciousness
science
back
in
the
1990s
researchers
focused
on
identifying
empirical
correlations
between
aspects
of
conscious
experience
and
properties
of
brain
activity
this
search
for
the
“
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
”
was
motivated
in
part
as
a
response
to
concerns
pervasive
through
much
of
the
20th
century
that
consciousness
lay
beyond
the
remit
of
science
altogether
but
despite
its
many
successes
this
approach
is
limited
because
correlations
aren
t
explanations
no
matter
how
many
you
identify
in
recent
years
however
there
has
been
a
blossoming
of
neurobiological
theories
of
consciousness
this
is
a
sign
of
the
field
s
growing
maturity
because
it
is
only
when
couched
in
terms
of
a
theory
that
experimental
findings
can
deliver
a
satisfactory
understanding
of
consciousness
there
are
currently
four
main
theoretical
approaches
in
consciousness
science
according
to
higherorder
theories
a
mental
state
is
conscious
when
another
mental
state
–
higher
up
in
a
hierarchy
–
says
that
it
is
for
these
theories
the
devil
is
in
the
detail
about
what
kinds
of
“
higherorder
”
representations
count
for
consciousness
global
workspace
theories
propose
that
mental
states
are
conscious
when
they
are
broadcast
widely
throughout
the
brain
so
that
they
can
be
used
to
flexibly
guide
behaviour
a
good
way
to
think
about
global
workspace
theory
is
that
consciousness
depends
on
“
fame
in
the
brain
”
–
conscious
mental
states
have
access
to
a
wide
range
of
cognitive
processes
in
ways
that
unconscious
mental
states

advertisement
take
our
online
consciousness
course
where
experts
anil
seth
nicola
clayton
and
christof
koch
reveal
neuroscience
s
deepest
mystery
these
two
theories
focus
on
functional
aspects
of
consciousness
and
emphasise
frontal
at
the
front
and
parietal
towards
the
back
and
off
to
the
sides
brain
regions
by
contrast
integrated
information
theory
focuses
on
phenomenological
aspects
of
consciousness
–
what
it
is
like
experientially
–
and
proposes
that
consciousness
is
associated
with
a
posterior
cortical
“
hot
zone
”
located
towards
the
back
of
the
brain
and
including
parts
of
the
parietal
temporal
and
occipital
lobes
according
to
this
theory
consciousness
depends
on
the
ability
of
a
system
to
generate
integrated
information
the
fourth
approach
known
as
predictive
processing
is
more
indirect
being
used
primarily
to
build
explanatory
bridges
between
aspects
of
consciousness
and
their
underlying
neural
mechanisms
there
are
several
examples
of
this
approach
ranging
from
those
which
associate
consciousness
with
topdown
signalling
in
the
brain
to
my
own
“
beast
machine
”
theory
for
these
theories
the
idea
is
that
by
progressively
accounting
for
diverse
aspects
of
consciousness
they
can
ultimately
shift
from
being
theories
for
consciousness
science
towards
being
theories
of
consciousness
