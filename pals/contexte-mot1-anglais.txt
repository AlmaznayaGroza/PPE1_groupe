GUILTY
CONSCIENCE/BAD
CONSCIENCE


[
]
---------------

[
]

Guilt
or
guilty
conscience
is
one
of
the
most
common
negative
or
sad
emotions
that
people
experience
almost
every
day
.


If
not
addressed
properly
,
a
guilty
conscience
can
destroy
your
relationship
,
steal
your
joy
,
your
happiness
,
and
even
your
future
.


Yet
,
the
majority
of
us
don
'
t
know
how
to
deal
with
it
in
a
healthy
way
.


According
to
the
German
philosopher
,
Friedrich
Nietzsche
(1844
-
1900
)
.


A
guilty
conscience
can
push
a
person
to
become
very
cruel
and
do
horrible
things
as
a
result
.


Horrible
things
like
killing
,
committing
suicide
,
etc
.


Yet
,
just
like
any
other
emotions
,
there
'
s
not
a
clear
definition
for
a
"guilty
conscience"
.


So
to
better
understand
what
it
is
,
one
has
to
explore
the
concept
of
right
and
wrong
within
society
.



---------------
himself/herself
a
"get-out-jail-free
card"
in
this
universe
.


To
maintain
emotional
and
psychological
balance
,
it
is
necessary
to
experience
guilt
for
our
bad
behavior
or
actions
.


Besides
,
a
guilty
conscience
is
like
having
a
snooze
alarm
in
your
head
that
won
'
t
shut
off
until
it
is
addressed
and
it
has
to
be
addressed
in
a
healthy
way
.



If
not
addressed
properly
,
a
guilty
conscience
will
make
it
very
hard
for
you
to
think
straight
and
make
the
right
decisions
when
necessary
,
a
guilty
conscience
can
also
trigger
shame
,
anger
,
emptiness
,
and
in
many
cases
,
sabotage
your
entire
life
and
your
relationship
with
others
.



A
guilty
conscience
that
is
not
addressed
properly
will
also
make
you
become
very
paranoid
and
delusional
.


For
example
;
a
guilty
conscience
may
make
you
feel
that
everything
people
say
or
write
in
their
social
media
pages
is
about
you
and
then
consider
it
as
a
personal
attack
---------------
Such
behavior
will
eventually
throw
you
off
balance
emotionally
and
psychologically
and
make
you
a
good
candidate
for
anxiety
,
depression
,
or
much
worse
.


A
guilty
conscience
can
also
make
you
hate
and
punish
yourself
,
avoid
hearing
nor
seeing
the
person
that
you
'
ve
wronged
,
it
will
also
push
you
to
talk
negatively
about
that
person
in
order
to
---------------
more
harm
to
him/her
should
you
get
the
opportunity
.



How
to
Effectively
Deal
with
a
Guilty
Conscience
?



1
)
The
first
step
in
dealing
with
a
guilty
conscience
is
always
to
surrender
to
the
truth
(Repentance
)
.


This
means
to
stop
fighting
or
denying
your
guilt
because
the
more
you
deny
it
the
more
intense
the
---------------
environment
as
soon
as
you
can
.



3
)
The
third
step
in
dealing
with
a
guilty
conscience
is
to
keep
your
emotions
and
behavior
in
check
at
all
time
.


There
'
s
nothing
more
embarrassing
for
a
person
than
not
being
unable
to
control
his/her
---------------
doing
things
it
will
repeat
itself
in
your
future
also
.


6
)
The
sixth
and
final
step
is
to
always
seek
professional
help
(psychologist
)
if
feel
like
you
'
re
overwhelmed
by
a
guilty
conscience
because
it
can
lead
to
more
severe
emotional
or
psychological
situations
,
even
suicide
.

Conscience
and
Moral
Rules
in
Adam
Smith

sympathy
impartial
spectator
duty
self-deceit
moral
sentiments
---------------

In
this
essay
I
explore
Adam
Smith’s
analysis
of
the
origins
of
conscience
and
general
moral
rules
in
The
Theory
of
Moral
Sentiments
.


I
argue
that
Adam
Smith
offers
a
distinction
between
moral
conscience
and
general
moral
rules
that
sidesteps
the
traditional
distinction
between
universal
and
relative
moral
standards
,
leading
to
a
fundamental
rethinking
of
the
problem
of
the
variability
of
moral
opinion
and
the
demands
of
moral
conscience
and
duty
.



Moral
Conscience

Like
the
thought
of
his
mentor
Francis
Hutcheson
and
of
his
friend
David
---------------
impartial
spectator
position
to
correct
for
any
bias
in
our
judgments
.



Smith’s
notion
of
moral
conscience
follows
directly
from
this
general
approach
.


He
believes
we
cultivate
a
moral
conscience
by
learning
to
view
ourselves
,
our
intentions
and
our
actions
from
a
position
of
impartial
spectatorship
.


From
this
position
,
we
cultivate
a
concern
with
praiseworthiness
and
blameworthiness
,
not
praise
and
blame
.


Being
virtuous
and
having
a
fully
developed
moral
conscience
for
Smith
represents
the
highest
stage
in
the
moral
development
of
an
individual
.



---------------
what
is
fit
and
proper
either
to
be
done
or
to
be
avoided”
(TMS
:
159
)
.


The
specific
mechanism
by
which
these
rules
are
formed
is
considerably
different
from
the
cultivation
of
conscience
.


Take
the
emergence
of
negative
rules
or
commands
that
order
us
not
to
do
something
.


We
observe
another’s
behavior
and
disapprove
of
it
.


We
hear
others
express
similar
---------------
words
,
general
moral
rules
are
formed
out
of
our
judgments
of
particular
experiences
that
we
observe
in
conjunction
with
the
judgments
of
others
.


A
desire
for
praise
or
an
aversion
to
blame
,
not
the
moral
conscience’s
concern
for
praiseworthiness
or
aversion
to
blameworthiness
,
compels
us
to
develop
them
.


After
these
general
rules
are
formed
and
“universally
---------------
notion
of
the
universality
of
the
moral
standards
that
have
emerged
in
the
society
in
which
we
live
.


Finally
,
this
view
explains
how
tensions
arise
when
the
judgments
of
our
moral
conscience
might
be
displaced
or
,
at
least
,
come
into
conflict
with
the
general
rules
that
are
established
in
a
particular
society
and
to
which
we
feel
deep
sentimental
attachments
.


In
Smith’s
world
,
there
is
no
guarantee
that
the
conclusions
of
our
sense
of
moral
conscience
will
dovetail
neatly
into
our
sense
of
duty
.



---------------

Smith’s
conclusions
about
the
difference
between
the
dictates
of
moral
conscience
and
our
sense
of
duty
to
obey
general
rules
are
profound
.


Virtuous
individuals
guided
by
moral
conscience
cultivate
the
feelings
that
are
appropriate
to
particular
situations
.


For
example
,
when
confronted
with
the
benevolent
behavior
of
another
,
they
feel
gratitude
---------------
conduct
can
be
much
depended
upon”
(TMS
:
163
)
.



The
Tension
between
Conscience
and
Duty

For
Smith
,
humans
are
subject
to
multiple
commands
in
ethics
,
some
stemming
from
the
dictates
of
conscience
and
others
from
duty
.


When
should
the
principle
of
duty
be
the
sole
principle
regulating
our
conduct
in
the
world
,
and
when
should
it
concur
with
other
motives
such
as
those
provided
by
moral
conscience
?


Conscience
and
duty
introduce
tension
into
Smith’s
understanding
of
moral
judgement
and
action
in
The
Theory
of
Moral
Sentiments
.


Understanding
that
tension
between
the
demands
of
conscience
and
duty
lies
at
the
heart
of
the
final
chapter
of
Part
VI
.



Some
moral
judgements
are
guided
primarily
by
moral
conscience
;
others
are
guided
by
general
rules
and
our
sense
of
duty
.


Given
the
characteristics
of
a
particular
passion
,
individuals
may
face
a
difficult
task
of
balancing
between
the
demands
of
conscience
and
of
duty
.


For
example
,
regarding
benevolent
and
social
sentiments
like
love
,
our
moral
judgements
and
actions
flow
naturally
from
our
benevolent
---------------
parliament
seeking
reelection
,
or
a
tradesman
seeking
a
special
job
,
must
be
grounded
,
at
least
in
part
,
by
the
passion
of
ambition
,
and
not
just
duty
or
conscience
,
for
successful
advancement
and
social
recognition
.



A
second
issue
that
follows
from
the
distinction
between
conscience
and
duty
involves
the
precision
and
exactness
of
the
general
moral
rules
themselves
.


Some
rules
are
clearer
and
more
important
to
society
than
---------------
Theory
of
Moral
Sentiments
and
remains
prone
to
misinterpretation
.


One
might
easily
argue
that
what
Smith
means
to
say
is
that
the
conclusions
of
conscience
are
the
general
laws
of
morality
backed
by
our
religious
sentiment
.


From
this
interpretation
,
conscience
can
easily
be
identified
as
“vicegerents
of
God”
that
reward
us
for
following
the
law
and
punish
us
for
breaking
it
.


If
my
reading
of
the
sharp
distinction
between
duty
and
conscience
is
correct
,
this
reading
is
seriously
mistaken
.


As
I
argue
above
,
our
general
rules
of
morality
are
generalizations
based
upon
our
observations
of
our
moral
judgments
in
conjunction
with
those
of
others
.


They
are
not
conclusions
of
our
moral
conscience
.


Conscience
deals
with
the
problem
of
praiseworthiness
,
duty
centers
upon
the
problem
of
praise
.


All
people
have
the
capacity
for
moral
generalization
.


All
people
do
not
have
a
highly
functioning
moral
sense
of
conscience
.


The
“vicegerents
of
God”
that
Smith
is
referring
to
are
not
just
the
sentiments
involved
with
conscience
.


They
encompass
all
our
moral
faculties
,
including
our
sense
of
propriety
and
impropriety
,
our
sense
of
merit
and
demerit
,
and
our
sense
of
duty
.



The
significance
of
the
distinction
between
conscience
and
duty
in
Smith’s
thought
is
revealed
most
clearly
at
the
end
of
Chapter
V
in
Part
III
.


Smith
emphasizes
that
while
he
wants
to
distinguish
between
duty
and
conscience
,
he
does
not
want
to
say
they
are
necessarily
antithetical
to
one
another
.


On
the
contrary
,
for
the
most
part
they
complement
one
another
.


He
comments
that
“the
general
rules
by
which
---------------

There
are
natural
limits
to
what
we
can
do
to
impose
the
teaching
of
our
consciences
upon
the
world
.


But
that
does
not
mean
that
we
must
deny
our
consciences
out
of
hand
.


Indignation
in
the
face
of
perceived
unfairness
is
a
natural
response
of
our
conscience
to
the
world
at
times
.


We
may
not
always
be
able
to
construct
the
world
in
the
way
that
we
wish
,
but
we
do
not
have
to
like
it
at
the
deepest
levels
of
our
being
.

present
at

of

him
at
the

to

evil
.


It

to
the
supreme
Good
to
which
the

and
it

.


When
he
listens
to
his
conscience
,
the
prudent
man

1778
Conscience
is
a
judgment
of
reason
whereby
the
human
person
recognizes
the
moral
quality
of
a
concrete
act
that
he
is
going
to
perform
,
is
in
the
process
of
performing
,
or
has
already
completed
.


In
all
he
says
and
does
,
man
is
obliged
to
follow
faithfully
what
he
knows
to
be
just
and
right
.


It
is
by
the
judgment
of
his
conscience
that
man
perceives
and
recognizes
the
prescriptions
of
the
divine
law
:

Conscience
is
a
law
of
the
mind
;
yet
[Christians
]
would
not
grant
that
it
is
nothing
more
;
I
mean
that
it
was
not
a
dictate
,
nor
conveyed
the
notion
of
responsibility
,
of
duty
,
of
a
threat
and
a
promise
.


.


.


.



[Conscience
]
is
a
messenger
of
him
,
who
,
both
in
nature
and
in
grace
,
speaks
to
us
behind
a
veil
,
and
teaches
and
rules
us
by
his
representatives
.


Conscience
is
the
aboriginal
Vicar
of
Christ
.

⁵⁰

1779
It
is
important
for
every
person
to
be
sufficiently
present
to
himself
in
order
to
hear
and
follow
the
voice
of
his
conscience
.


This
requirement
of
interiority
is
all
the
more
necessary
as
life
often
distracts
us
from
any
reflection
,
self-examination
or
introspection
:

Return
to
your
conscience
,
question
it
.


.


.


.


Turn
inward
,
brethren
,
and
in
everything
you
do
,
see
God
as
your
witness
.

⁵¹

1780
The
dignity
of
the
human
person
implies
and
requires
uprightness
of
moral
conscience
.


Conscience
includes
the
perception
of
the
principles
of
morality
(synderesis
)
;
their
application
in
the
given
circumstances
by
practical
discernment
of
reasons
and
goods
;
and
finally
judgment
about
concrete
acts
yet
to
be
performed
or
already
performed
.


the
truth
about
the
moral
good
,
stated
in
the
law
of
reason
,
is
recognized
practically
and
concretely
by
the
prudent
judgment
of
conscience
.


We
call
that
man
prudent
who
chooses
in
conformity
with
this
judgment
.



1781
Conscience
enables
one
to
assume
responsibility
for
the
acts
performed
.


If
man
commits
evil
,
the
just
judgment
of
conscience
can
remain
within
him
as
the
witness
to
the
universal
truth
of
the
good
,
at
the
same
time
as
the
evil
of
his
particular
choice
.


the
verdict
of
the
judgment
of
conscience
remains
a
pledge
of
hope
and
mercy
.


In
attesting
to
the
fault
committed
,
it
calls
to
mind
the
forgiveness
that
must
be
asked
,
the
good
that
must
still
be
practiced
,
and
the
virtue
that

1782
Man
has
the
right
to
act
in
conscience
and
in
freedom
so
as
personally
to
make
moral
decisions
.


"He
must
not
be
forced
to
act
contrary
to
his
conscience
.


Nor
must
he
be
prevented
from

according
to

doing

conscience
is
the

heart

revealing

to
us

calling
us
to
do
what
is

 The
moral
conscience
urges
a

it

enables

to

understand

decide
how

 The

of
his

conscience

(#1782

 The
Catechism
says
a
person’s

that
it

Being
a
leader
of

Leadership
---------------
Written
By
Jon
Mertz

What
does
a
leader
of
conscience
mean
?


It
begins
with
character
to
avoid
distorted
values
with
a
centered
focus
on
virtues
of
humanity
.


A
leader
of
conscience
engages
in
community
conversations
and
identifies
what
virtues
to
act
upon
in
the
choices
being
made
.



Sparked
by
Professor
Richard
Shell
'
s
new
book
,
The
Conscience
Code
,
I
explored
what
being
conscience
means
.


It
led
me
to
the
Ethics
Centre
,
a
non-profit
in
Sydney
,
Australia
.


The
Ethics
Centre
defines
conscience
as
:

---------------
2
.


How
a
person
decides
what
is
right

While
conscience
sounds
simple
,
it
quickly
gets
complicated
as
we
encounter
situations
in
which
variables
challenge
us
in
what
we
believe
and
what
we
decide
is
right
.


In
some
cases
,
our
conscientious
voice
gets
it
right
immediately
.


Other
times
,
confusion
reigns
.



Our
conscience
and
character
are
intimately
linked
.



Our
character
builds
specific
values
,
and
those
values
become
engraved
---------------
Virtues
are
"attitudes
,
dispositions
,
or
character
traits
that
enable
us
to
be
and
to
act
in
ways
that
develop
this
potential
[humanity
]
.

"
The
development
of
humanity
is
crucial
when
considering
our
conscience
and
how
we
decide
what
to
do
in
challenging
situations
.



---------------
conversation
,
which
leads
to
a
focus
beyond
our
self-interests
.



Connecting
conscience
to
character
and
virtues
is
imperative
.



Too
often
lately
,
values
are
being
distorted
to
protect
a
power
base
rather
than
engaging
the
value
in
how
it
helps
humanity
.


Making
a
switch
to
virtues
can
raise
the
leadership
standard
.


A
new
conscience
accountability
checklist
:

-
After
our
conscience
determines
an
approach
,
ask
what
virtue

supports
the
decision
.



---------------

We
all
need
to
engage
in
conversations
about
virtues
and
begin
to
raise
the
standard
of
being
a
leader
of
conscience
.

How
Can
I
Have
a
Good
Conscience
?




[
]
---------------
labors
on
this
podcast
!


My
question
is
one
that
I
have
struggled
with
for
over
two
decades
now
.


It’s
this
:
How
can
I
live
with
a
good
conscience
?


The
apostle
Paul
often
talks
about
the
conscience
,
and
how
specifically
a
‘good
conscience’
is
something
he
always
lived
with
,
apparently
even
before
he
became
a
Christian
(Acts
23
:1
;
24
:16
)
.


We
also
see
that
a
‘good
conscience’
is
a
qualification
for
Christian
leaders
(1
Timothy
3
:9
)
.


And
having
a
‘good
conscience’
is
an
important
goal
of
the
Christian
life
for
all
believers
(1
Timothy
1
:5
,
19
)
.



“When
I
read
the
way
Paul
uses
the
word
conscience
in
these
contexts
,
it
seems
like
he’s
saying
it
means
to
be
‘presently
walking
in
obedience
to
everything
God
has
revealed
to
him
.

’
He
does
not
seem
to
mean
that
he’s
---------------
for
forgiveness
(according
to
1
John
1
:8–10
and
Matthew
6
:12
)
.



“All
this
means
that
I
literally
never
have
a
good
conscience
—
I
am
always
aware
of
important
ways
in
which
I
presently
need
to
repent
and
become
more
holy
.


So
if
a
good
conscience
is
a
basic
Christian
issue
,
and
Paul
always
had
one
,
yet
I
will
always
know
of
sin
areas
in
my
life
—
and
if
I
have
to
pray
daily
for
forgiveness
—
how
could
I
,
or
any
Christian
for
that
matter
,
ever
attain
to
a
good
conscience
?

”

Well
,
Arnaldo
has
done
his
homework
.


He
laid
out
texts
in
that
question
,
---------------

I
feel
the
force
of
the
question
.


Experientially
,
walking
in
a
good
conscience
is
not
easy
for
me
since
I
share
Arnaldo’s
deep
awareness
of
my
ongoing
,
indwelling
sin
.


That’s
Paul’s
term
in
Romans
7
:17
,
20
,
23
.


We
all
have
remaining
corruption
and
indwelling
sin
.


The
more
keenly
you
are
aware
of
that
,
the
more
you
will
feel
embattled
at
the
level
of
needing
a
good
conscience
.




“The
whole
New
Testament
does
assume
that
in
this
life
,
nobody
attains
---------------
to
the
publican
who
said
,
“God
,
be
merciful
to
me
,
a
sinner
!

”
over
against
the
Pharisee
who
was
thanking
God
that
he
had
such
a
clear
conscience
—
and
he
said
that
the
one
who
cried
out
for
mercy
about
his
sin
went
down
to
his
house
justified
(Luke
18
:10–14
)
.


It
was
good
for
him
to
own
his
sinfulness
,
not
to
say
,
“Oh
,
it
doesn’t
exist
.


I’ve
got
a
clear
conscience
.


I
don’t
have
any
sin
to
repent
of
.

”
We
feel
the
force
.



Now
,
I
think
1
John
1
is
not
only
especially
illuminating
but
gives
us
a
category
alongside
good
conscience
that
may
provide
the
solution
.



Walking
in
the
Light
---------------
cleansing
and
forgiveness
.




“A
good
conscience
is
virtually
the
same
as
walking
in
the
light
.

”

Here’s
what
I
would
draw
from
this
if
I
use
the
category
of
conscience
to
explain
this
passage
:
a
good
conscience
is
virtually
the
same
as
walking
in
the
light
.


Christians
should
be
able
to
say
,
“I’m
walking
in
the
light
,”
and
mean
it
,
and
mean
by
that
,
“I’m
walking
in
a
good
conscience
.

”
Which
means
I
don’t
think
we
should
equate
having
a
bad
conscience
with
having
indwelling
sin
.


Now
,
that
may
be
the
most
important
thing
I
say
,
Tony
.


Let
me
say
it
again
.


I’m
inferring
,
from
what
I’ve
said
from
1
John
1
,
that
having
a
bad
conscience
is
not
the
same
as
having
indwelling
sin
.


They’re
not
the
same
.



Our
Clear
Conscience

That’s
my
basic
answer
to
Arnaldo’s
question
.


He
feels
that
as
long
as
he
is
aware
of
the
reality
of
indwelling
sin
,
as
in
Romans
7
,
he
cannot
have
a
good
conscience
.


Now
,
if
that
were
true
,
I
don’t
think
Paul
could
ever
have
a
good
conscience
,
but
he
clearly
says
he
does
have
a
good
conscience
.



“I
thank
God
whom
I
serve
,
as
did
my
ancestors
,
with
a
clear
conscience”

(2
Timothy
1
:3
)
.


He
expects
the
elders
of
the
church
to
do
the
same
:
“They
must
hold
the
mystery
of
the
faith
with
a
clear
conscience”
(1
Timothy
3
:9
)
.


That’s
the
goal
for
all
Christians
.


According
to
1
Timothy
1
:5
,
“The
aim
of
our
charge
is
love
that
issues
from
a
pure
heart
and
a
good
conscience
and
a
sincere
faith
.

”
I
don’t
think
we
should
equate
a
good
conscience
with
sinless
perfection
in
this
life
,
nor
equate
a
bad
conscience
with
the
presence
of
indwelling
sin
or
remaining
corruption
.


Rather
,
a
clear
or
a
good
conscience
is
like
walking
in
the
light
.




If
we
walk
in
the
light
,
as
he
is
in
the
light
,
we
have
fellowship
---------------

I
think
both
Paul
and
John
inherited
this
concept
of
ongoing
,
indwelling
sin
that
nevertheless
coexists
with
a
good
conscience
from
the
Psalms
in
the
Old
Testament
.



---------------
not
the
only
place
in
the
Psalms
;
there
are
a
lot
of
psalms
that
distinguish
the
righteous
and
the
wicked
.


The
righteous
are
really
righteous
:
they’re
walking
in
the
light
;
they
have
a
good
conscience
.


In
David’s
mind
,
there
is
an
integrity
and
an
uprightness
that
is
aware
of
indwelling
corruption
that
breaks
out
at
times
in
sins
.


It
does
.


And
---------------
and
used
language
that
way
.


John
used
the
language
of
walking
in
the
light
though
we
are
imperfect
.


Paul
used
the
language
of
walking
in
a
good
conscience
though
we
are
imperfect
.


I
think
for
all
of
them
(David
,
Paul
,
John
)
,
the
key
that
enabled
them
to
think
this
way
is
that
they
all
knew
God
had
made
a
way
for
all
their
sins
to
be
passed
over
—
---------------

I
do
think
Arnaldo
is
right
to
say
that
justification
by
faith
is
not
the
same
as
walking
in
a
good
conscience
,
or
walking
in
the
light
,
or
having
integrity
.


Those
are
real
character
traits
,
not
imputed
righteousness
.


Nevertheless
,
it’s
the
covering
of
all
their
sins
by
the
blood
of
Jesus
that
enables
them
to
look
upon
their
conscience
and
walking
and
integrity
with
thankfulness
and
confidence
that
it
really
will
be
accepted
by
God
as
good
,
though
imperfect
.


---------------
No
,
no
,
no
.


That
is
not
the
time
to
say
that
with
your
kids
listening
,
and
your
wife
listening
,
and
the
whole
church
wondering
.


What
you
need
to
say
at
that
moment
is
this
:
“My
conscience
is
clear
.


I
am
a
man
of
integrity
.


I
have
walked
in
the
light
.


I
have
never
touched
that
woman
or
any
woman
sexually
besides
my
wife
.


This
accusation
is
not
true
.

”
---------------
I
think
that
is
one
of
the
implications
of
what
Paul
is
saying
when
he
says
to
the
elders
and
to
the
rest
of
us
that
we
should
walk
in
a
good
conscience
—
or
as
John
would
say
,
walk
in
the
light
.

What
to
Know


Though
they
sound
similar
,
conscience
is
a
noun
referring
to
the

awareness
that
one
'
s
actions
are
right
or
wrong
,
as
in
one
'
s
"guilty

conscience
,"
while
conscious
is
an
adjective
meaning
"awake"
or

"alert
.

"
If
you
were
asleep
you
would
be
"unconscious
.

"
To
keep
them

straight
,
remember
to
stay
conscious
of
what
your
conscience
is

telling
you
to
do
.



As
conscientious
lexicographers
,
we
are
conscious
of
the
occasional
mix-up
of
the
words
conscience
and
conscious
.


Here
are
some
examples
that
caught

If
you
stopped
to
double-check
if
conscience
or
conscious
was
actually
being
used
incorrectly
in
any
of
the
above
examples
,
this

will
help
you
to
readily
differentiate
the
words
and
use
them
with
confidence
in
the
future—since
,
honestly
,
there
were
no
trick
examples
.


And
if
wrongly
using
conscience
in
place
of

,
has

we
encourage
you
to

---------------
It
'
s
our
moral
obligation
to
help
.



Conscience
and
conscious
derive
from
the
same
Latin
roots—the
prefix
com-
("with
,"
"together
,"
"jointly"
)
and
the
verb
scire
("to
know"
)
,
and
the
combination
,
conscire
,
means
"to
be
aware
of
guilt"—and
both
relate
to
a
state
of
awareness
,
the
first
of
a
moral
awareness
and
the
second
of
a
physical
or
mental
wakefulness
in
which
a
person
is
aware
of
their
surroundings
.


English
speakers
are
first
made
aware
of
conscience
in
the
13th
century
,
and
conscious
in
the
16th
.



Conscience
and
conscious
have
similar
pronunciations
,
which
,
for
some

causes
confusion
.


(Their
first
syllables
are
pronounced
the
same
,
and
they
both
contain
a
middle
\sh\
sound

)
For
those
who
hesitate
on
which
to
use
,
learning
the
words
'

suffixes
and
their
meanings
and
also
the
words
'

parts
of
speech
might
be
the
best
approach
in
differentiating
them
.


Conscience
,
having
the
noun
suffix
-ence
,
meaning
"quality
or
state
,"
is
,
well
,
a
noun
,
and
conscious
,
having
the
adjective
suffix
-ous
,
meaning
"having
,"
is
an
adjective
.



What
Does
Conscience
Mean
?



The
noun
conscience
refers
to
a
state
of
awareness
or
a
sense
that
one
'
s
actions
or
intentions
are
either
morally
right
or
wrong
,
along
with
a
feeling
of
obligation
to
do
the
right
thing
.


Cartoons
often
personify
the
conscience
as
a
proverbial
angel/devil
pair
who
talk
into
the
ear
of
an
indecisive
character
,
encouraging
him
or
her
to
follow
either
a
path
of
moral
virtue
or
of
moral
corruption
.


In
the
Walt
Disney
movie
Pinocchio
,
metaphorically
,
the
conscience
is
the
dapper
talking
cricket
,
named
Jiminy
Cricket
,
whose
maxim
"always
let
your
conscience
be
your
guide"
he
teaches
the
title
character
,
a
marionette
who
is
magically
brought
to
life
and
becomes
a
real
human
boy
after
proving
himself
brave
,
truthful
,
and
selfless
(after
listening
to
his
conscience
)
.


Some
examples
of
the
noun
conscience
are
:


You
should
decide
what
to
do
according
to
your
own
conscience
.




Her
conscience
was
bothering
her
,
so
she
finally
told
the
truth
.




I
cannot
do
anything
that
is/goes
against
my
conscience
.




He
could
not
in
good
conscience
allow
this
situation
to
continue
.




I
have
to
tell
you
the
truth
because
I
don
'
t
want
this
on
my

conscience
any
longer
.



What
Does
Conscious
Mean
---------------
environmentally
conscious
activist
.


Additionally
,
conscious
can
modify
an
act
or
decision
that
is
done
deliberately
(and
one
that
might
very
well
result
in
conscious
guilt
or
a
guilty
conscience
)
.



Hopefully
,
you
are
now
fully
(or
at
least
semi-
)
conscious
of
the
differences
in
using
conscience
and
conscious—the
most
essential
one
being
that
conscience
is
a
noun
and
conscious
is
an
adjective
,
which
describes
nouns
.


Keep
in
mind
that
whenever
you
are
in
a
difficult
situation
,
you
should
be
conscious
about
what
your
conscience
is
telling
you
.


Your
conscience
will
help
you
make
moral
,
just
,
and
fair
decisions
.


As
for
remembering
the
spelling
of
the
noun
:
conscience
contains
the
word
science
(also
a
noun
)
,
and
as
science
tells
us
how
the
forces
of
nature
and
the
universe
behave—or
should—the
conscience
tells
us
how
we
should
behave—or
should
.

Reading
the
philosophical
and
historical
literature
on
conscience
,
the
first
thing
one
would
notice
is
the
variety
of
meanings
and
psychological
and
ethical
assessments
of
the
concept
.


Different
philosophical
,
religious
and
common
sense
approaches
to
conscience
have
emphasized
different
aspects
of
the
following
,
broad
characterization
:
through
our
individual
conscience
,
we
become
aware
of
our
deeply
held
moral
principles
,
we
are
motivated
to
act
upon
them
,
and
we
assess
our
character
,
our
behavior
and
ultimately
our
self
against
those
principles
.


The
resulting
more
specific
understandings
of
conscience
will
be
presented
in
the
sections
below
.


On
any
of
these
accounts
,
conscience
is
defined
by
its
inward
looking
and
subjective
character
,
in
the
following
sense
:
conscience
is
always
knowledge
of
ourselves
,
or
awareness
of
moral
principles
we
have
committed
to
,
or
assessment
of
ourselves
,
or
motivation
to
act
that
comes
from
within
us
(as
opposed
to
external
impositions
)
.


This
inward
looking
and
subjective
character
of
conscience
is
also
reflected
in
the
etymological
relation
between
the
notion
of
“conscience”
and
that
of
consciousness
.


Only
after
the
17
^
(th
)
Century
did
“consciousness”
start
to
be
used
with
a
distinct
meaning
referring
to
the
psychological
and
phenomenal
dimension
of
the
mind
,
---------------
shift
,
see
Jorgensen
2014
)
.



The
term
“conscience”
translates
the
Latin
“conscientia”
,
which
refers
to
sharing
“knowledge”
(scientia
)
“with”
(con-
)
,
and
which
in
turns
translates
the
equivalent
Greek
term
suneidenai
(see
Pierce
1955
and
---------------
whom
that
knowledge
is
shared
with
.


However
,
the
concept
has
traditionally
been
used
to
refer
to
moral
knowledge
(we
talk
indifferently
of
conscience
and
moral
conscience
)
that
is
shared
with
oneself
.


This
reference
to
the
self
does
not
rule
out
that
the
source
of
the
morality
in
question
be
external
to
the
self
.


For
example
,
it
might
---------------
or
of
one’s
upbringing
,
as
in
the
Freudian
theory
of
the
Super-Ego
.


Reference
to
the
self
indicates
that
,
from
a
psychological
point
of
view
,
conscience
involves
introspection
,
awareness
of
one’s
behavior
,
and
self-assessment
.


As
we
shall
see
,
although
these
aspects
often
overlap
,
they
are
psychologically
and
conceptually
distinct
functions
.


---------------
ideal
observer
(for
instance
a
god
,
an
imagined
moral
model
,
an
impartial
spectator
)
.


Unfortunately
,
debates
in
which
appeals
to
conscience
are
often
made—for
example
the
debate
about
conscientious
objection
in
health
care—are
often
characterized
by
a
lack
of
clarity
as
to
what
it
exactly
is
that
we
are
talking
about
when
we
talk
about
conscience
,
and
therefore
about
what
exactly
people
are
claiming
when
they
put
forward
a
“conscientious
objection”
to
,
for
example
,
abortion
.


In
what
sense
does
abortion
violate
the
conscience
of
a
committed
Catholic
doctor
?


And
is
conscience
amenable
to
reason
and
public
discussion
,
or
are
appeals
to
conscience
ultimately
based
on
intuitions
and
private
morality
?


In
what
sense
is
a
conscientious
choice
different
from
a
mere
moral
preference
?


The
notion
of
conscience
is
in
need
of
conceptual
clarification
.



This
entry
will
expound
the
main
features
of
the
notion
of
conscience
as
it
is
used
in
philosophical
discussion
,
religious
teaching
and
in
common
language
alike
.


The
perspective
adopted
here
will
be
theoretical
,
rather
---------------
examples
are
drawn
from
Christian
source
.


The
entry
is
structured
around
four
possible
,
but
not
mutually
exclusive
,
ways
of
conceptualizing
conscience
.


These
will
be
preceded
by
an
introductory
section
outlining
the
pluralistic
,
morally
neutral
and
subjective
nature
of
the
concept
of
conscience
.


The
four
main
aspects
of
conscience
that
will
be
described
are
the
following
.


Section
2
discusses
conscience
as
a
faculty
for
self-knowledge
and
self-assessment
.


Section
3
presents
the
epistemic
aspect
of
conscience
that
allows
the
formation
of
moral
beliefs
,
distinguishing
the
different
possible
sources
of
moral
principles
that
inform
such
beliefs
.


In
section
4
,
conscience
will
be
described
as
a
motivational
force
or
as
the
source
of
our
sense
of
duty
,
which
already
presupposes
a
body
of
moral
knowledge
or
of
moral
beliefs
.


Finally
,
section
5
will
focus
on
conscience
understood
as
the
body
of
personal
core
and
self-identifying
moral
beliefs
which
is
often
taken
to
be
the
basis
of
moral
integrity
(Fuss
1964
;
Wicclair
2011
)
and
of
our
sense
of
personal
identity
(Childress
1979
)
.


As
discussed
in
section
6
,
this
last
approach
to
conscience
is
often
used
with
a
political
function
to
advocate
freedom
of
thought
and
action
in
liberal
democratic
societies
,

Conscience
as
pluralistic
,
neutral
and
subjective

The
concept
of
conscience
does
not
bear
any
connection
with
any
particular
substantial
moral
view
(Broad
1940
)
.


The
voice
of
conscience
might
suggest
different
principles
and
different
behaviors
to
different
people
.


In
other
words
,
there
is
no
psychological
or
conceptual
relation
between
conscience
and
any
particular
moral
belief
.


However
,
as
will
be
explained
below
,
in
the
Catholic
tradition
the
idea
of
an
erroneous
conscience
is
sometimes
used
to
refer
to
conscience
that
fails
to
recognize
the
true
moral
laws
which
it
is
naturally
predisposed
to
“witness”
within
our
heart
.


As
for
secular
accounts
of
conscience
,
the
independence
of
the
notion
of
conscience
from
any
substantial
moral
content
can
be
understood
in
three
senses
.



First
,
conscience
is
a
pluralistic
notion
.


To
say
that
a
person
acted
with
conscience
or
that
something
violates
someone’s
conscience
does
not
entail
anything
about
what
this
act
consists
of
or
what
this
person’s
moral
values
are
(although
it
might
tell
us
that
conscience
is
itself
a
value
this
person
holds
dear
)
.


To
use
a
metaphor
,
conscience
is
like
an
empty
box
that
can
be
filled
with
any
type
of
moral
content
.


As
put
by
Strohm
,


conscience
has
what
might
be
called
an
“identity
problem”—that
it

possesses
no
fixed
or
inherited
content
of
its
own
,
and
that
it
can
be

hailed
and
mobilized
in
defence
of
one
position
or
equally
in
defence
---------------
For
example
,
while
some
health
practitioners
raise
“conscientious”
objection
to
abortion
and
refuse
to
provide
the
service
,
someone’s
conscience
might
demand
the
exact
opposite
,
i
.

e
.


,
to
perform
abortions
in
order
to
respect
what
is
conscientiously
believed
to
be
a
woman’s
right
(Joffe
1995
)
.



Second
,
conscience
is
typically
a
morally
neutral
concept
.


Appealing
to
conscience
does
not
usually
add
anything
to
the
moral
justification
of
any
particular
conduct
or
principle
.


Unless
one
is
committed
to
the
relativistic
idea
that
your
belief
(or
your
conscience
)
about
x
being
right
or
wrong
is
what
makes
it
right
or
wrong
for
you
to
do
x
(Foot
1979
)
,
something
is
not
made
morally
better
or
worse
,
acceptable
or
unacceptable
,
simply
by
being
a
matter
of
conscience
.


For
example
,
the
morality
of
abortion
has
nothing
to
do
with
abortion
being
conscientiously
opposed
by
some
health
practitioners
or
conscientiously
supported
by
others
.


This
neutrality
does
not
exclude
,
however
,
that
an
appeal
to
conscience
can
represent
itself
as
a
reason
for
respecting
someone’s
moral
views
,
for
example
a
reason
for
granting
someone
a
right
to
object
to
carrying
out
certain
activities
.


While
appeals
to
conscience
do
not
typically
provide
any
moral
reason
in
defense
of
a
certain
moral
stance
(unless
one
is
a
relativist
)
,
they
might
ground
political
reasons
for
respecting
individuals’
moral
beliefs
,
such
as
for
example
tolerance
or
pluralism
.



Finally
,
conscience
only
concerns
the
subjective
dimension
of
morality
.


Even
assuming
that
there
are
ethical
values
that
,
in
some
sense
,
can
be
considered
objective
,
conscience
only
refers
to
what
individuals
believe
,
independently
of
any
external
,
objective
proof
or
justification
.


And
when
people
state
what
they
subjectively
and
conscientiously
believe
,
they
acknowledge
that
other
people
might
(and
probably
will
)
subjectively
and
conscientiously
hold
different
moral
views
.


Thus
,
when
I
say
that
abortion
violates
my
conscience
,
I
am
not
saying
(although
I
might
be
thinking
)
that
abortion
is
morally
wrong
by
some
objective
standard
,
and
I’m
not
necessarily
trying
to
convince
---------------
standard
.



These
three
aspects
related
to
the
independence
of
conscience
from
particular
substantial
moral
views
explain
why
appeals
to
conscience
to
justify
one’s
behavior
are
usually
made
with
the
expectation
that
no
further
reason
for
the
behavior
in
question
be
required
.


As
put
by
Childress
,
when
an
agent
appeals
to
her
conscience
,


[u
]sually
the
agent
has
given
up
the
attempt
to
convince
others
of
the
---------------

rightness
.


(Childress
1979
:
329

Conscience
as
self-knowledge
and
self-assessment

When
we
talk
about
conscience
,
we
often
refer
to
reflection
about
ourselves
as
moral
persons
and
about
our
moral
conduct
.


Through
conscience
we
examine
ourselves
,
as
if
we
were
our
own
inner
judge
.


The
image
of
an
individual
split
into
two
persons
,
one
who
acts
and
the
other
who
observes
the
former’s
conduct
,
reflects
the
original
conception
of
“conscience”
in
the
Greek
world
,
at
least
from
the
5
^
(th
)
century
BCE
(Sorabji
2014
:
12
)
.


But
such
self-
knowledge
may
also
be
thought
of
as
shared
with
others
inside
of
us
,
such
as
God
(s
)
or
other
---------------
actions
(Kant
1797
)
.



The
role
of
conscience
in
this
sense
is
not
that
of
merely
gaining
knowledge
about
our
behavior
or
character
.


The
knowledge
in
question
is
typically
(though
,
as
explained
below
,
not
always
)
the
ground
for
a
moral
assessment
by
conscience
.


When
observing
one’s
behavior
,
conscience
is
more
like
a
judge
(or
sometimes
it
is
identified
with
the
judgment
itself
)
than
like
a
disinterested
observer
.


Thus
,
for
instance
,
the
impartial
spectator
with
which
Adam
Smith
identified
conscience
,
inspired
by
the
Stoic’s
notion
of
conscience
as
an
imagined
admired
philosopher
judging
one’s
conduct
,
is
not
a
morally
and
emotionally
neutral
observer
,
but
generates
a
sentiment
of
approval
or
disapproval
of
oneself
(Smith
1759
and
discussion
in
Raphael
2007
:
34
)
.


Even
in
the
Catholic
view
,
where
the
main
characterization
of
conscience
is
that
of
a
witness
of
God’s
law
in
our
hearts
(as
described
in
section
3
)
,
conscience
is
also
presented
as
“a
moral
judgment
about
man
and
his
actions
,
a
judgment
either
of
acquittal
or
condemnation”
(John
Paul
II
1993
:
59
)
.


Analogously
,
in
the
Kantian
view
,
conscience
is
conceived
of
as
an
inner
court
(Wood
2008
:
184
)
:
it
is
moral
self-awareness
that
allows
one
to
apply
the
moral
law
suggested
by
practical
reason
to
our
moral
conduct
,
and
to
judge
whether
we
have
complied
with
the
moral
law
.


As
Kant
defines
it
in
the
Metaphysics
of
Morals
,
conscience
is


practical
reason
holding
the
human
being’s
duty
before
him
for
his
---------------

consciousness
of
an
internal
court
in
man
.


(Kant
1797
[1991
:
189
]
)

This
understanding
of
conscience
as
an
inner
court
is
well
illustrated
by
the
story
of
Huckleberry
Finn
in
Mark
Twain’s
famous
novel
(Twain
1884
;
Bennett
1974
)
.


In
a
well-known
episode
of
the
novel
,
Huck
feels
guilty
and
blameworthy
for
having
helped
his
slave
friend
Jim
to
escape
from
his
owner
Miss
Watson
.


Blame
does
not
come
from
some
external
moral
authority
,
but
it
is
a
verdict
issued
by
conscience
according
to
its
moral
laws
.


The
bites
of
conscience
in
Huck’s
case
were
caused
by
a
tension
between
his
feelings
supporting
what
he
did
and
the
principles
he
had
inherited
from
his
social
environment
.


At
the
time
when
the
novel
---------------
helping
slaves
run
away
meant
depriving
someone
of
her
private
property
.


This
was
the
“law”
(metaphorically
speaking
)
against
which
Huck’s
conscience
assessed
his
behavior
.



This
story
illustrates
another
interesting
feature
of
conscience
as
a
faculty
for
self-assessment
,
i
.

e
.


,
the
asymmetry
between
our
confidence
in
the
validity
of
the
moral
standards
provided
by
our
own
conscience
and
our
confidence
in
the
validity
of
the
standards
provided
other
people’s
conscience
.


Huck
thinks
that
what
he
did
was
wrong
and
that
it
rendered
him
blameworthy
in
spite
of
his
feelings
,
because
he
thinks
that
his
own
conscience
provides
a
correct
moral
standard
,
i
.

e
.


,
a
standard
that
he
endorses
even
if
some
of
his
feelings
or
beliefs
indicate
otherwise
.


This
seems
to
reflect
our
common
way
of
relating
to
our
own
conscience
:
we
try
to
adjust
our
feelings
and
judgments
to
our
conscience’s
standard
,
rather
than
vice
versa
.


However
,
the
same
does
not
hold
when
we
talk
of
other
people’s
conscience
,
which
is
usually
taken
to
indicate
their
subjective
moral
standard
and
does
not
imply
that
we
are
endorsing
it
.


This
asymmetry
suggests
that
there
is
no
conceptual
relation
between
the
notion
of
conscience
per
se
and
the
notion
of
an
objective
or
correct
moral
standard
;
rather
,
it
stresses
once
more
the
fact
that
conscience
has
merely
to
do
with
one’s
private
morality
and
one’s
commitment
to
her
own
morality
.



Consistently
with
this
understanding
of
conscience
as
self-knowledge
and
self-assessment
,
it
has
been
suggested
by
some
that
psychopaths—i
.

e
.


,
pathological
subjects
who
display
antisocial
behavior
and
systematically
act
without
regard
to
what
they
consider
to
be
right
or
wrong—can
be
said
to
lack
conscience
(Hare
1999
)
.


For
instance
,
according
to
Vujošević
(2015
)
,
in
psychopaths
the
link
between
moral
knowledge
or
beliefs
and
self-directed
feelings
of
condemnation
(e
.

g
.


,
guilt
)
is
---------------

As
mentioned
above
in
this
section
,
when
expressing
itself
through
self-evaluative
feelings
,
conscience
might
be
conceived
of
as
either
constituted
by
such
feelings
(Fuss
1964
)
or
as
occasioning
them
(Broad
1940
)
.



In
the
former
sense
(conscience
as
constituted
by
self-evaluative
feelings
)
,
the
feeling
is
an
essential
part
of
conscience
.


Conscience
in
this
case
is
better
conceived
not
as
a
judge
who
issues
sentences
,
but
as
a
feeling
with
cognitive
content—where
the
cognitive
content
concerns
---------------
cases
,
the
negative
feeling
informs
me
that
what
I
am
doing
or
am
contemplating
doing
is
wrong
(according
to
my
own
moral
parameters
)
.


In
the
latter
sense
(conscience
as
occasioning
self-evaluative
feelings
)
,
the
inner
judge
,
when
in
tension
with
one’s
conduct
,
generates
negative
self-directed
feelings
(Mill
1861
:
ch
3
)
.


For
instance
,
in
Freud
the
“Super-Ego”—the
part
of
our
personality
that
attends
to
prohibitions
,
inhibitions
and
moral
constraints—takes
“the
form
of
conscience”
to
exercise
its
control
over
one’s
impulses
and
instincts
by
producing
negative
evaluative
feelings
towards
the
individual
,
such
as
aggressiveness
towards
the
Ego
and
guilt
(Freud
1929
[2000
:
30
]
)
.


As
we
shall
see
below
in
section
4
,
these
self-directed
negative
feelings
play
an
essential
role
in
fulfilling
the
motivational
function
of
conscience
.



As
the
characterization
of
conscience
as
self-assessment
here
presented
suggests
,
conscience
has
most
often
been
associated
with
negative
feelings
(Arendt
1971
)
,
such
as
shame
,
guilt
,
fear
,
contrition
.


For
most
of
us
,
even
in
our
common
language
,
conscience
is
something
that
yields
negative
feelings
more
often
than
not—for
example
we
often
talk
of
the
“bites
of
conscience”
or
of
conscience
as
causing
us
“remorse”
(which
derives
from
the
Latin
“remordere”
,
i
.

e
.


,
“to
bite
again”
)
.


However
,
a
joyful
conscience
that
praises
and
takes
pride
of
one’s
own
moral
merit
can
be
conceived
as
well
.


Examples
of
joyful
conscience
can
be
found
for
instance
in
Cicero
and
some
Latin
Stoics
,
most
prominently
Seneca

(Sorabji
2014
:
25–30
)
.


Also
in
the
Protestant
tradition
started
by
Luther
we
find
the
idea
of
a
joyful
conscience
,
where
joy
springs
not
from
pride
or
self-praise
,
but
from
awareness
of
God’s
future
remission
of
sins
(Luther
1535
;
Calvin
1536
)
.



The
contrast
between
the
Protestant
joyful
conscience
and
the
Catholic
conscience
burdened
by
negative
feelings
of
guilt
and
fear
was
emphasized
by
Luther
when
he
denounced
the
“terrorization
of
conscience”
by
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
.


According
to
Luther
,
with
this
terrorization
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
aimed
to
reinforce
its
authority
and
control
over
people’
conscience
.


In
fact
,
conscience
in
the
Catholic
tradition
can
only
be
relieved
from
its
burden
of
negative
feelings
through
the
confession
of
one’s
sins
to
a
priest
and
the
penitence
decided
by
that
priest
.

The
epistemic
function
of
conscience

Along
with
the
previous
,
non-epistemic
conception
of
conscience
,
we
can
also
understand
conscience
as
having
an
epistemic
function
.


In
this
sense
,
conscience
brings
us
some
form
of
moral
knowledge
or
moral
beliefs—either
in
an
absolute
sense
,
e
.

g
.


,
knowledge
of
divine
laws
,
or
in
a
relative
sense
,
e
.

g
.


,
knowledge
of
social
norms
in
one’s
culture
.



The
epistemic
role
of
conscience
does
not
necessarily
coincide
with
the
role
of
epistemic
faculties
or
functions
such
as
reason
,
intuitions
,
or
senses
.


In
particular
,
that
conscience
“brings”
us
moral
knowledge
or
beliefs
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
it
gives
us
direct
access
to
the
source
of
this
knowledge
or
of
these
beliefs
,
as
might
be
the
case
with
reason
,
intuitions
,
or
senses
.



The
knowledge
we
get
from
conscience
,
understood
as
possessing
an
epistemic
function
,
is
often
conceived
as
mediated
knowledge
.


This
is
not
surprising
,
since
,
as
we
have
seen
,
conscience
is
mostly
understood
as
inward
looking
,
which
presupposes
that
the
knowledge
to
which
it
gives
us
access
is
already
within
us
and
that
we
acquired
it
through
some
other
process
not
involving
conscience
.


In
fact
,
on
many
accounts
,
conscience
does
not
generate
its
own
moral
principles
.


For
example
,
the
moral
contents
we
discover
within
us
can
be
acquired
through
divine
intervention
,
as
is
the
case
with
the
laws
of
nature
which
,
according
to
Christians
,
God
infuses
in
our
heart
.


As
we
are
going
to
see
in
subsection
3
.

1
,
the
understanding
of
conscience
as
having
an
epistemic
function
and
as
the
recipient
of
mediated
knowledge
is
not
exclusive
to
religious
views
.



On
other
accounts
of
conscience
,
however
,
conscience
does
give
us
direct
access
to
moral
knowledge
,
for
example
as
an
intuition
about
what
is
good
and
what
is
bad
.



Let
us
examine
the
two
accounts
of
the
epistemic
role
of
conscience
in
more
detail
.



3

1
Conscience
as
a
faculty
for
indirect
moral
knowledge

In
the
Christian
tradition
,
starting
from
Paul
,
the
inward
looking
character
of
conscience
is
emphasized
by
the
metaphor
of
the
witness

(Romans
2
:
14–15
)
.


Conscience
does
not
allow
us
to
acquire
the
knowledge
of
the
moral
law
directly
from
an
external
source
(God
in
this
case
)
,
but
only
to
witness
the
presence
of
God’s
laws
within
us
.


Conscience
cannot
directly
contemplate
God
.


The
idea
of
a
faculty
that
gives
us
indirect
,
and
therefore
imperfect
knowledge
of
some
external
moral
authority
suits
religious
traditions
very
well
.


For
example
,
the
idea
that
through
conscience
we
discover
the
true
divine
laws
can
also
be
found
in
Islam
(Geaves
1999
:
164
)
.



It
is
important
to
note
that
also
in
this
case
,
as
in
the
previous
understanding
of
conscience
as
self-awareness
and
self-assessment
,
conscience
can
be
conceived
as
fulfilling
an
introspective
function
,
i
.

e
.


,
as
being
directed
towards
the
self
and
towards
one’s
own
mental
states
.


Introspection
allows
one
to
gain
self-knowledge
(Schwitzgebel
---------------
before
his
papacy
,
Joseph
Ratzinger
said
that
“something
like
an
original
memory
of
the
good
and
the
true
(the
two
are
identical
)
has
been
implanted
in
us”
,
and
conscience
is


so
to
speak
an
inner
sense
,
a
capacity
to
recall
,
so
that
the
one
whom
---------------

The
Catholic
Church
also
makes
reference
to
“the
voice
of
the
Lord
echoing
in
the
conscience
of
every
individual”
(John
Paul
II
1995
:
par
.


24
)
.



On
this
account—since
conscience
is
only
a
witness
and
does
not
have
direct
epistemic
access
to
the
source
of
knowledge
,
i
.

e
.


,
to
God—conscience
is
considered
fallible
and
actually
often
erroneous
(1
Corinthians
4
:4
;
Aquinas
1265–1274
;
Butler
1726
:
sermon
3
(3
)
)
.


In
particular
,
conscience
might
fail
to
correctly
interpret
the
divine
laws
when
applying
them
to
real
cases
.


According
to
some
13
^
(th
)
Century
Catholic
theologians
,
such
as
Philip
the
Chancellor
,
Albert
the
Great
and
,
most
notably
,
Thomas
Aquinas
,
conscience
is
the
act
of
applying
universal
principles
(i
.

e
.


,
divine
laws
)
to
real
situations
,
i
.

e
.


,
it
is
the
conclusion
of
the
practical
syllogism
whose
first
premise
is
a
universal
principle
provided
by
a
separate
faculty
called
“synderesis”

(Aquinas
,
Summa
Theologiae
,
1
q79
;
Langston
2000
and
2015
;
Sorabji
2014
:
62–66
)
:
as
such
,
conscience
can
be
erroneous
in
deriving
moral
conclusions
from
first
principles
(Aquinas
,
On
Truth
,
q17
,
art
.


2
,
and
discussion
in
D’Arcy
1961
:
100–103
)
.


However
,
other
Catholic
thinkers
have
emphasized
the
essential
role
of
conscience
in
humans
search
for
the
truth
.


Cardinal
John
Henry
Newman
,
for
instance
,
saw
conscience
as
the
moral
sense
that
can
lead
us
to
the
moral
truth
.


As
such
,
conscience
is
in
his
view
both
epistemic
and
action
guiding
,
but
the
two
aspects
are
not
distinguishable
,
to
the
extent
that
the
moral
truth
is
what
guides
our
actions
.


As
he
wrote
,
“The
feeling
of
conscience
…
is
twofold
:
it
is
a
moral
sense
,
and
a
sense
of
duty
;
a
judgment
of
the
reason
and
a
magisterial
dictate
.


Of
course
its
act
is
indivisible
;
---------------
instills
moral
principles
in
us
is
not
God
,
but
one’s
own
culture
or
upbringing
.


In
this
case
,
the
moral
knowledge
in
question
is
typically
understood
in
a
relativistic
sense
:
our
conscience
is
the
faculty
through
which
the
social
norms
of
our
culture
or
the
norms
of
our
upbringing
are
evoked
and
exert
their
influence
on
our
moral
psychology
.


These
norms
explain
our
moral
feelings
and
our
moral
choices
,
but
what
conscience
tells
us
in
this
case
is
the
product
of
social
and
cultural
dynamics
over
which
we
have
little
control
.


As
the
case
of
Huckleberry
Finn’s
conscience
demonstrates
,
hardly
can
conscience
so
understood
be
credited
any
moral
authority
,
since
our
educators
or
our
culture
might
be
highly
immoral
(for
example
our
conscience
might
end
up
drawing
on
racist
or
discriminatory
principles
,
such
as
the
ones
which
supported
slavery
in
Huck’s
social
environment
)
.


And
in
fact
,
unsurprisingly
,
many
are
rather
skeptical
or
dismissive
of
the
moral
authority
of
conscience
,
since
they
see
it
as
mere
opinion
about
moral
principles
influenced
or
even
determined
by
one’s
own
culture
(Montaigne
1580
:
book
1
,
ch
.


22
;
Hobbes
1651
:
ch
.


7
)
.


In
this
sense
,
conscience
is
a
merely
relativistic
notion
whose
content
changes
according
to
social
,
cultural
,
and
familial
circumstances
.

Conscience
as
a
faculty
for
direct
moral
knowledge

Contrary
to
what
Montaigne
and
Hobbes
had
claimed
,
Rousseau
argued
in
Emile
,
or
Education
that
good
education
can
free
conscience
from
the
corrupting
influences
of
societies
.


Actually
,
one
of
the
aims
of
education
is
to
render
the
young
autonomous
moral
thinkers
and
agents
by
teaching
them
how
to
critically
examine
and
,
if
necessary
,
replace
received
norms
(Rousseau
1762
;
see
Sorabji
2014
,
for
a
discussion
)
.


The
idea
here
is
that
conscience
is
what
remains
of
our
innate
moral
sense
once
we
free
it
from
“childish
errors”
and
“prejudices
of
our
upbringing”
(Rousseau
1921
[1762
]
:
253
)
.


As
Rousseau
presents
it
,
---------------

justice
and
virtue
,
by
which
,
in
spite
of
our
maxims
,
we
judge
our
own

actions
or
those
of
others
to
be
good
or
evil
;
and
it
is
this

principle
that
I
call
conscience
.


(Rousseau
1921
[1762
]
:
253
)

According
to
Rousseau
,
then
,
conscience
has
a
natural
tendency
to
perceive
and
follow
the
right
order
of
nature
,
and
a
good
teacher
should
help
the
young’s
conscience
to
do
what
it
is
naturally
predisposed
to
do
.


In
Rousseau’s
words
:


Too
often
does
reason
deceive
us
;
we
have
only
too
good
a
right
to

doubt
her
;
but
conscience
never
deceives
us
;
she
is
the
true
guide
of

man
;
it
is
to
the
soul
what
instinct
is
to
the
body
;
he
who
obeys
his

conscience
is
following
nature
and
he
need
not
fear
that
he
will
go

astray…
Let
us
obey
the
call
of
nature
;
we
shall
see
that
her
yoke
is

easy
and
that
when
we
give
heed
to
her
voice
we
find
a
joy
in
the

answer
of
a
good
conscience
.


(Rousseau
1921
[1762
]
:
252
)

This
understanding
of
conscience
as
a
deeper
form
of
moral
knowledge
brings
us
to
the
second
sense
in
which
conscience
can
be
said
to
have
an
epistemic
role
.


As
well
as
merely
witnessing
received
opinions
or
divine
laws
,
conscience
can
also
be
conceived
as
a
moral
sense
giving
us
direct
access
to
moral
principles
.


Understood
in
this
way
,
conscience
is
typically
seen
as
intuitive
and
influenced
by
emotions
,
rather
than
a
reason-based
faculty
.


In
particular
,
18
^
(th
)
Century
sentimentalist
philosophers
often
(e
.

g
.


,
Shaftesbury
(1711
)
and
Hume
(1738–1740
)
)
identified
conscience
with
a
moral
“sentiment”
or
moral
“sense”
.


According
to
Hume’s
psychological
theory
,
for
instance
,
“reason
is
wholly
inactive
and
can
never
be
the
source
of
so
active
a
principle
as
conscience
,
or
a
sense
of
morals”
(Hume
1738–1740
:
book
3
,
part
1
,
section
1
)
.


Also
on
more
recent
accounts
of
conscience
and
of
private
morality
,
the
dictates
of
conscience
can
be
understood
as
expressions
of
our
moral
intuitions
.


According
to
Thagard
and
Finn
(2011
)
,
for
instance
,
“conscience
is
a
kind
of
moral
intuition”
(p
.


168
)
that
is
“both
cognitive
and
emotional”
(p
.

156
)
.



Once
again
,
there
are
reasons
to
doubt
the
epistemic
and
moral
authority
of
conscience
so
understood
.


A
lot
of
work
in
recent
moral
psychology
aimed
at
understanding
moral
disagreement
has
suggested
that
there
are
seemingly
irreconcilable
differences
in
fundamental
moral
intuitions
and
emotions
among
people
with
different
worldviews
(e
.

g
.


,
Haidt
2012
;
Greene
2013
)
.


These
differences
in
fundamental
moral
intuitions
seem
to
undermine
the
epistemic
status
of
conscience
and
,
with
it
,
conscience’s
moral
authority
,
not
least
because
most
of
our
moral
intuitions
seem
,
according
to
these
recent
developments
in
moral
psychology
,
not
to
be
amenable
to
revision
in
light
of
new
evidence
or
new
good
reasons
.


Reasoning
,
on
any
plausible
account
,
should
be
an
important
part
of
morality
;
however
,
what
our
conscience
tells
us
may
have
little
to
do
with
reasons
and
evidence
.


Theoretical
work
in
moral
psychology
(e
.

g
.


,
Haidt
2012
;
Graham
et
al
.


2009
;
Haidt

)
,
supported
by
evidence
from
---------------
liberal
views
are
often
driven
by
other
specific
emotions
,
e
.

g
.


,
anger
,
and
intuitions
,
e
.

g
.


,
intuitive
rejection
of
fairness
violations
or
liberty
infringements
(Haidt
2001
and
2012
)
.


If
conscience
simply
is
the
expression
of
moral
intuition
,
and
if
individuals
have
significantly
different
and
irreconcilable
moral
intuitions
,
then
individuals
also
have
significantly
different
and
difficult-to-reconcile
conscientious
moral
consciences
.

Conscience
as
motivation
to
act
morally

Conscience
can
also
be
conceived
as
our
sense
of
duty
.


According
to
this
understanding
,
conscience
motivates
us
to
act
according
to
moral
principles
or
beliefs
we
already
possess
(e
.

g
.


,
D’Arcy
1963
;
Childress
1979
;
McGuire
1963
;
Fuss
1964
)
.


Conscience
so
understood
“establishes
a
general
sense
of
moral
obligation
in
the
individual’s
consciousness”

(Fuss
1964
:
116
)
.


The
subjective
character
of
conscience
implies
that
the
motivational
force
must
come
entirely
from
within
the
individual
,
as
opposed
to
sanctions
from
an
external
authority
.



A
powerful
motivational
source
is
represented
by
the
feelings
that
conscience
generates
in
its
self-assessment
function
.


As
we
said
at
the
beginning
,
the
different
understandings
of
conscience
presented
here
are
not
necessarily
mutually
exclusive
.


Conscience
as
self-assessment
and
conscience
as
motivation
to
act
morally
constitute
a
good
example
of
perspectives
on
conscience
which
are
not
only
consistent
with
one
another
,
but
which
actually
complete
one
another
.


In
Kant
,
for
example
,
the
theory
of
conscience
can
be
seen
as
“a
motivation
theory
set
in
the
context
of
a
reflection
theory”
(Wood
2008
:
183
)
:
As
Wood
interprets
the
Kantian
notion
of
conscience
,
“conscience
is
a
feeling
of
pleasure
or
displeasure
associated
with
myself”
that
arises
when
I
comply
or
don’t
comply
with
moral
principles
and
that
motivates
me
to
act
in
one
sense
rather
than
the
other
when
the
feeling
accompanies
the
contemplation
of
a
certain
course
of
action
(Wood
2008
:
183–184
)
.


Conscience
for
Kant
is
therefore
not
only
an
inner
court
,
but
also
a
source
of
motivation
to
act
morally
,
that
is
,
motivation
to
follow
our
sense
of
duty
as
determined
by
reason
(Kant
1797
[1991
:
161
]
)
.



More
generally
,
as
we
have
seen
in
section
1
,
conscience’s
self-assessment
often
produces
remorse
or
other
negative
feelings

(guilt
,
shame
,
fear
,
and
so
on
)
.


Our
desire
or
tendency
to
avoid
this
form
of
self-punishment
can
have
motivational
force
towards
acting
morally
.


Thus
,
for
instance
,
according
to
Childress
the
motive
for
acting
morally
that
defines
conscience
is
“in
part
,
avoidance
of
a
sanction
imposed
by
the
self
on
itself”
(Childress
1979
:
328
)
.



Consistent
with
this
philosophical
view
are
studies
in
developmental
psychology
suggesting
that
the
emotion
of
guilt
,
which
is
typically
seen
as
one
of
the
products
of
conscience
as
self-assessment
,
is
“the
motivational
engine
that
infuses
misdeeds
with
negative
personal
valence”
(Kochanska
and
Aksan
2006
:
1589
)
.


Transgression
generates
---------------
self-directed
feelings
presuppose
one
another
,
this
need
not
be
the
case
.


It
is
possible
to
conceive
of
an
external
or
independent
source
of
that
most
fundamental
sense
of
duty
that
constitutes
our
conscience
,
such
as
for
example
our
moral
education
and
upbringing
(Mill
1861
:
ch
.


3
)
.


But
the
sense
of
duty
that
identifies
a
conscientious
person
can
also
be
conceived
as
a
primitive
function
,
an
innate
disposition
which
is
not
explained
by
any
other
more
fundamental
mechanism
.


In
Kant
,
for
instance
,
“every
human
being
,
as
a
moral
being
,
has
a
conscience
within
him
originally”
(Kant
1797
[1991
:
160
]
)
,
and
conscience
is
one
of
the
four
“natural
predispositions
of
the
mind
(…
)
for
being
affected
by
concepts
of
duty”
,
the
other
three
being
moral
feeling
,
love
for
one’s
---------------
Negative
feelings
and
sense
of
duty
are
not
always
successful
in
prompting
agents
to
do
what
their
moral
principles
require
.


But
the
“bites
of
conscience”
,
or
just
the
prospect
of
bites
of
conscience
,
act
as
motivational
force
towards
aligning
our
future
behavior
to
those
norms
.


Of
course
,
positive
feelings
associated
with
conscience
might
also
have
a
motivational
force
.


For
example
,
as
seen
above
,
Kant
associated
conscience
also
with
positive
feelings
about
oneself
when
the
agent
recognizes
he
has
acted
according
to
his
sense
of
duty
.


Rousseau
,
alongside
the
epistemic
account
of
conscience
presented
above
,
also
provides
in
Emile
a
motivational
account
of
conscience
based
on
positive
feelings
:
while
reason
gives
us
knowledge
of
the
good
,
it
is
conscience
,
through
a
sentiment
of
love
for
the
good
,
which
motivates
us
to
behave
morally
(Rousseau
1762
)
.

Conscience
,
self-identifying
moral
commitments
,
and
moral
integrity

The
subjective
character
of
conscience
delimits
a
sphere
of
personal
morality
that
is
an
essential
part
of
our
sense
of
personal
identity
,
understood
as
our
sense
of
who
we
are
and
of
what
characterizes
qualitatively
our
individuality
(for
instance
,
our
character
,
our
psychological
traits
,
our
past
experience
,
etc
.


)
.


My
conscience
is
what
makes
me
this
particular
individual
in
a
social
and
cultural
context
that
I
want
to
keep
separate
from
me
.



This
private
space
in
which
the
individual
finds
her
own
sense
of
identity
often
grounds
the
political
use
of
the
notion
of
conscience
.


Thus
,
many
people
claim
the
right
to
stick
to
their
conscience—particularly
by
advancing
so
called
“conscientious
objection”—when
social
expectations
or
legal
obligations
would
demand
otherwise
.


These
political
appeals
to
conscience
are
usually
made
on
the
basis
of
two
principles
.


The
first
is
the
principle
of
respect
for
moral
integrity
,
which
finds
its
justification
in
the
close
relationship
between
the
notions
of
conscience
and
of
moral
integrity
on
one
side

(Childress
1979
)
,
and
the
sense
of
personal
identity
on
the
other
.


The
second
principle
often
invoked
in
the
political
uses
of
“conscience”
is
the
principle
of
“freedom
of
conscience”
.


The
former
will
be
discussed
in
this
section
,
and
the
latter
in
the
next
section
.



The
concept
of
personal
identity
in
the
sense
in
which
the
notion
is
used
here—i
.

e
what
defines
me
as
this
particular
person
in
a
qualitative
sense—is
intimately
related
to
the
notions
of
conscience
(Wicclair
2011
;
Childress
1979
)
and
of
moral
integrity
,
and
more
specifically
to
the
“identity
view
of
integrity”
(Cox
et
al
.


2013
;
Williams
1973
and
1981
)
.


---------------
their
life
is
fundamentally
about”
(Cox
et
al
.


2013
)
.


This
identity-conferring
aspect
of
one’s
morality
is
exactly
what
some
people
call
“conscience”
.


According
to
Childress
,
for
example
,


[i
]n
appealing
to
conscience
I
indicate
that
I
am
trying
to
preserve
a

sense
of
myself
,
my
wholeness
and
integrity
,
my
good
conscience
,
and

that
I
cannot
preserve
these
qualities
if
I
submit
to
certain

requirements
of
the
state
or
society
.


(Childress
1979
:
327
)

Conscience
as
self-identifying
can
be
understood
in
two
ways
.


It
can
be
thought
of
either
as
a
set
of
core
and
self-identifying
moral
beliefs
that
are
“integral
to
an
agent’s
understanding
of
who
she
is
(i
.

e
.


,
her
---------------
viewed
in
relation
to
one’s
self
and
character”
(Bluestein
1993
:
294
)
.



Conceived
in
either
way
,
conscience
is
an
essential
part
of
our
understanding
of
what
kind
of
person
we
are
,
and
this
is
taken
to
be
a
reason
for
warranting
protection
of
conscience
and
conscientious
objection
in
different
contexts
,
particularly
in
the
health
care
professions
(Wicclair
2011
:
25–26
;
Bluestein
1993
:
295
)
.



We
have
seen
above
that
there
is
a
sense
in
which
,
according
to
some
,
psychopaths
can
be
said
to
lack
conscience
(Hare
1999
)
:
psychopaths
are
not
capable
of
connecting
their
moral
knowledge
to
their
conduct
through
the
feelings
of
guilt
and
disapproval
which
conscience
,
on
some
accounts
,
produces
.


Interestingly
,
according
to
some
psychologists
,
psychopaths
are
also
less
likely
to
base
their
sense
of
personal
---------------
leads
us
to
say
that
a
certain
individual
is
not
the
same
person
anymore

(Strohminger
and
Nichols
2015
)
.


These
findings
provide
empirical
support
to
the
idea
that
conscience
is
essential
to
one’s
sense
of
personal
identity
and
to
attributions
of
personal
identity

6
.


Freedom
of
conscience

Some
people
have
suggested
that
appeals
to
freedom
of
conscience
tend
to
be
more
vigorously
put
forward
and
more
effective
in
contexts
where
political
or
religious
structures
lose
power
or
moral
authority
.


Thus
,
for
instance
,
according
to
C
.

A
.


Pierce
:


conscience
only
came
into
its
own
in
the
Greek
world
after
the

collapse
of
the
city-state
.


The
close
integration
of
politics
with

ethics
,
with
the
former
predominant
,
was
no
longer
possible
:
there
was

no
sufficiently
close
authority
,
external
to
the
individual
,

effectively
to
direct
conduct
.


Consequently
,
as
a
pis
aller
,
men
fell

back
on
the
internal
chastisement
of
the
conscience
as
the
only

authority
.


(Pierce
1955
:
76
)

The
same
can
be
said
for
17
^
(th
)
Century
England
,
with
its
crisis
of
religious
authority
and
the
frequent
appeals
to
freedom
of
conscience
in
the
philosophical
and
political
literature
of
that
time
(Childress
1979
:
326
)
.



There
are
three
main
arguments
that
can
be
used
to
defend
a
principle
of
freedom
of
conscience
.


Two
of
them
are
frequently
found
in
the
16
^
(th
)
and
17
^
(th
)
Century
philosophical
literature
:
they
are
the
“argument
from
ineffectiveness
or
hypocrisy”
and
the
“argument
from
ignorance”
---------------
a
)
The
argument
from
ineffectiveness
or
hypocrisy
is
based
on
the
relevance
of
the
distinction
between
beliefs
and
acts
for
the
definition
of
conscience
.


According
to
this
argument
,
it
is
not
possible
to
compel
someone
to
believe
or
to
not
believe
something
,
i
.

e
.


,
to
change
one’s
conscientious
beliefs
.


All
we
can
do
is
compel
people
to
act
as
if
they
---------------
if
some
authority
aims
to
convert
people
or
to
change
people’s
moral
views
,
prohibiting
the
free
expression
,
through
actions
,
of
one’s
conscience
would
not
serve
this
purpose
.



This
line
of
argument
was
often
put
forward
by
early
Christians
,
most
---------------
practice
their
cult
in
a
time
where
they
were
persecuted
by
Roman
governors
:
their
claim
was
that
forcing
them
to
abandon
the
Christian
cults
would
have
no
effect
on
their
conscience
.


The
same
line
of
argument
can
also
be
found
in
Locke’s
works
on
toleration
,
the
Essay
Concerning
Toleration
of
1667
and
A
Letter
Concerning
Toleration
of
---------------

However
,
Christians
did
not
seem
to
believe
in
the
force
of
this
argument
,
and
more
generally
in
the
principle
of
freedom
of
conscience
,
when
,
later
on
,
they
attempted
to
justify
the
violent
persecution
of
heretics
(those
who
revise
their
religious
dogmas
)
and
apostates
(those
---------------
to
follow
the
true
religion—by
which
he
meant
persecuting
heretics—could
open
their
eyes
to
the
truth
(Sorabji
2014
:
49–50
)
.


This
thesis
implies
that
sometimes
conscience
,
even
if
we
confine
it
to
matters
of
inward
conviction
and
not
to
behavior
,
can
be
influenced
by
some
external
imposition
.



This
latter
approach
based
on
the
idea
of
bringing
the
truth
to
conscience
by
“freeing”
conscience
from
error
is
consistent
with
the
Catholic
peculiar
understanding
of
the
notion
of
freedom
of
conscience
.


Philosophically
speaking
,
“freedom
of
conscience”
is
typically
understood
as
an
individualistic
concept
that
allows
for
a
plurality
of
moral
and
religious
views
(Strohm
2011
:
90
)
.


For
the
Catholic
Church
,
---------------
Newman
,
Joseph
Ratzinger
writes
that
in
the
Catholic
view
“truth”
is
the
middle
term
that
reconciles
authority
of
God
and
subjectivity
of
conscience
:
the
latter
,
when
authentically
free
,
cannot
but
reveal
the
truth
established
by
the
former
(Ratzinger
1991
[2010
]
)
.


Since
,
as
we
have
seen
above
,
in
the
Catholic
view
reason
alone
can’t
create
its
own
---------------
of
that
law”
of
God
(John
Paul
II
1993
:
par
.


35
)
.


So
when
practical
reason
is
free
to
exercise
its
“participation”
(John
Paul
II
1993
:
sec
.


40
)
in
the
divine
law
,
then
“in
the
depths
of
his
conscience
,
man
detects
a
law
which
he
does
not
impose
upon
himself
,
but
which
holds
him
to
obedience”
(Paul
VI
1965
:
par
.


16
)
.


---------------
In
any
case
,
it
is
not
necessary
to
dismiss
the
argument
from
ineffectiveness
in
order
to
justify
imposing
norms
and
practices
that
might
violate
individuals’
conscience
.


Actually
,
the
same
argument
from
ineffectiveness
can
be
used
to
support
the
imposition
of
policies
that
might
conflict
with
individuals’
consciences
.


On
the
basis
of
the
idea
that
conscience
is
merely
a
matter
of
private
beliefs
,
not
of
action
,
some
authors
have
argued
that
compelling
people
to
follow
certain
rules
even
against
their
conscience
would
not
constitute
a
violation
of
their
freedom
of
conscience
,
and
is
therefore
justifiable
.


This
was
the
line
of
argument
pursued
,
for
example
,
by
Thomas
Hobbes
(1651
:
chapter
40
)
,
Baruch
Spinoza
(1670
:
chapter
20
)
and
John
Locke
(1660
)
,
who
argued
that
the
State
has
the
power
to
enforce
certain
practices
even
when
citizens
claim
that
it
would
violate
their
conscience
,
in
order
to
protect
social
order
.



b
)
The
“argument
from
ignorance”
,
which
might
be
better
labeled
“argument
from
humility”
,
is
based
on
a
skeptical
approach
to
the
content
of
conscience
.


The
possibility
exists
that
what
we
conscientiously
believe
is
wrong
and
that
those
holding
conscientious
beliefs
opposite
to
ours
are
right
.


Therefore
,
there
is
a
reason
for
not
---------------
a
significant
proportion
of
its
religious
and
moral
authority
following
the
Protestant
reform
in
16
^
(th
)
and
17
^
(th
)
Century—which
was
defined
by
Keith
Thomas
(1993
)
as
“the
age
of
conscience”
.


It
was
at
that
time
that
we
assisted
to
the
“secularization
of
conscience”
in
the
modern
era

(Strohm
2011
)
,
although
the
phenomenon
would
be
better
conceived
of
as
a
“re-secularization”
,
since
conscience
was
not
related
to
the
voice
or
the
authority
of
God
in
the
Greek
world
.



---------------
John
Locke
in
his
Second
Letter
Concerning
Toleration
.


Locke
had
to
rely
on
this
argument
as
an
alternative
strategy
to
defend
freedom
of
conscience
after
the
Anglican
priest
Jonas
Proast
pointed
out
that
compulsion
can
actually
change
personal
beliefs
(as
Augustine
had
argued
)
,
and
that
therefore
the
argument
from
ineffectiveness
that
Locke
---------------
conscientious
objection
in
health
care
.



c
)
Finally
,
the
third
argument
in
defense
of
freedom
of
conscience
is
what
I
have
called
above
the
“argument
from
legitimization”
.


John
Stuart
Mill
(1859
)
defended
freedom
of
conscience
by
appealing
to
the
idea
that
allowing
the
free
expression
of
any
opinion
,
and
particularly
mistaken
opinions
,
would
allow
truth
to
emerge
more
clearly
and
would
provide
us
---------------

any
rational
assurance
of
being
right
.

1859
:

Freedom
of
conscience
and
conscientious
objection
today

Freedom
of
conscience
is
today
protected
by
the
United
Nations
Universal
Declaration
of
Human
Rights
,
which
reads
:
“Everyone
has
the
right
to
freedom
of
thought
,
conscience
and
religion”
(art
.


18
)
.



According
to
Strohm
,
this
article
should
not
be
taken
to
imply
freedom
to
act
according
to
one’s
conscience
,
but
it
only
refers
to
“matters
of
inward
conviction”
(Strohm
2011
:
88
)
.


If
this
interpretation
is
correct
,
article
18
does
not
seem
to
raise
any
interesting
philosophical
or
---------------
matters
of
inward
conviction
.


More
problematic
is
the
moral
and
political
debate
about
the
freedom
to
act
,
or
to
refrain
from
acting
,
according
to
one’s
conscience
,
especially
where
there
are
professional
roles
or
legal
obligations
that
would
demand
otherwise
.


In
fact
,
appeals
to
conscience
and
freedom
of
conscience
are
often
deployed
to
claim
and
justify
“conscientious
objection”
to
certain
activities
that
someone
would
otherwise
be
required
to
perform
.


---------------

As
most
States
have
now
abolished
conscription
,
appeals
to
freedom
of
conscience
and
to
conscientious
objection
today
can
be
found
mainly
in
debates
in
medical
ethics
with
regard
to
health
practitioners
who
conscientiously
object
to
performing
medical
procedures
they
morally
---------------

According
to
those
who
are
against
a
right
to
conscientious
objection
,
professional
obligations
trump
any
value
conscience
might
have
and
any
principle
that
might
justify
conscientious
objection
qua
conscientious

;
according
to
defenders
of
conscientious
objection
,
professionals’
conscience
must
be
protected
to
the
largest
extent
possible
,
i

e

,

to

point
where

significantly
jeopardize
physical
or

health
of
patients

However
,
if
it
is
the
validity
or
the
soundness
of
the
reasons
provided
which
is
considered
relevant
for
the
justification
of
conscientious
objection
,
it
seems
that
the
value
of
conscience
and
the
principle
of
freedom
of
conscience
are
no
longer
at
stake
.


What
makes
an
objection
good
or
bad
,
acceptable
or
unacceptable
,
has
nothing
to
do
with
its
being
conscientious
,
unless
we
add
a
“genuineness
requirement”

Conclusion

There
is
no
such
a
thing
as
the
notion
of
conscience
,
both
in
a
philosophical
and
in
a
psychological
sense
.


As
we
have
seen
,
the
concept
of
conscience
has
been
given
different
interpretations
throughout
history
,
sometimes
on
the
basis
of
underlying
systematic
philosophical
theories
of
the
mind
and
of
morality
,
and
sometimes
serving
religious
or
---------------
This
lack
of
uniformity
is
not
only
a
problem
for
historians
and
theoretical
philosophers
.


Because
it
cannot
be
immediately
clear
what
we
are
talking
about
when
we
talk
of
conscience
,
of
freedom
of
conscience
,
or
of
conscientious
objection
,
it
is
important
that
clarity
is
made
every
time
conscience
is
appealed
to
in
different
branches
of
applied
philosophy
(particularly
medical
ethics
)
and
in
public
debates
alike
.



This
entry
has
presented
a
conceptual
map
,
rather
than
a
historical
account
,
of
conscience
,
which
can
provide
some
guidance
for
those
engaged
in
this
clarificatory
task
.


One
of
the
benefits
of
clarifying
concepts
,
and
clarifying
them
in
the
different
circumstances
in
which
they
are
used
,
is
their
subsequent
demystification
.



Conscience
needs
to
be
demystified
,
since
it
is
one
of
those
concepts
that
tend
to
elicit
reverence
rather
than
questions
or
an
interest
in
further
inquiry
.


As
seen
above
,
appeals
to
conscience
often
replace
reason
giving
and
are
made
with
the
expectation
that
no
further
reason
for
one’s
decisions
and
positions
is
requested
.


This
attitude
is
also
displayed
in
many
legislative
approaches
dealing
with
the
notion
of
conscience
;
in
particular
,
legislations
about
conscientious
objection
in
health
care
typically
grant
doctors
a
right
to
object
to
performing
certain
professional
activities
(e
.

g
.


,
conscientious
objection
to
---------------
let
alone
submitting
reasons
to
some
form
of
assessment
.



This
entry
has
distinguished
four
main
understandings
of
conscience
,
drawing
on
the
philosophical
tradition
of
the
concept
.


Whether
the
concept
is
to
be
understood
as
a
faculty
for
self-knowledge
and
---------------
self-identifying
moral
beliefs
,
or
a
combination
of
any
of
these
characterizations
,
it
is
important
to
have
clear
in
mind
what
exactly
we
are
talking
about
when
we
talk
of
conscience
and
of
freedom
of
conscience
in
each
circumstance
.



Far
from
being
a
conversation-stopper
,
conscience
can
only
find
its
proper
place
in
philosophical
and
in
public
discussion
if
its
philosophical
and
psychological
aspects
are
teased
out
,
defined
and
assessed
.


Appeals
to
conscience
can
only
be
part
of
philosophical
,
political
,
and
legal
discussion
if
they
are
seen
as
the
start
,
not
the
end
of
discussions
.

Few
novelists
have
captured
the
ultimate
ambiguity
of
conscience
better
than
Mark
Twain
did
in
Huckleberry
Finn
.


Jim
,
the
escaped
slave
who
accompanies
Huck
down
the
river
on
a
raft
,
is
on
a
journey
to
reunite
with
his
beloved
family
(whom
white
people
have
separated
from
him
)
.


In
several
scenes
,
Huck
,
beset
with
guilt
for
not
handing
Jim
over
to
the
authorities
as
his
conscience
naggingly
instructs
him
to
,
anguishes
over
his
default
role
as
an
escapee
'
s
accomplice
.



---------------
concerned
father
figure
he
never
had
but
in
many
ways
as
a
paragon
of
virtue
,
despite
the
color
of
his
skin
,
Huck
decides
to
disobey
his
conscience
.


In
doing
so
,
he
demonstrates
the
courage
many
literary
critics
have
cited
as
constituting
the
novel
'
s
moral
climax
:

---------------


It
don
'
t
make
no
difference
whether
you
do
right
or
wrong
,
a
person
'
s

conscience
ain
'
t
got
no
sense
,
and
just
goes
for
him
anyway
.



But
because
Huck
isn
'
t
yet
mature
or
free-thinking
enough
to
triumph
---------------
freedom—which
,
despite
tremendous
personal
risks
,
Jim
so
desperately
seeks
because
of
his
dedication
to
his
wife
and
children—would
be
to
mirror
his
society
'
s
corrupted
conscience
.


Huck
'
s
safeguarding
of
Jim
from
all
the
people
who
'
d
prefer
(primarily
for
ignoble
reasons
)
to
return
him
to
slavery
can
be
comprehended
as
depicting
a
true
versus
an
artificial
,
culturally-derived
conscience
.



Ernest
Hemingway
,
deeply
influenced
by
Twain
'
s
plain-spoken
style
and
---------------
definitions
of
morality
as
simplistic—and
frequently
false
.



Defining
conscience
from
a
religious
perspective

Let
'
s
now
look
at
customary
definitions
of
conscience
to
illustrate
how
they
stop
short
of
accounting
for
the
many
ambiguities
so
often
found
in
reality
,
for
what
'
s
ideal
and
what
'
s
practically
possible
can
at
times
---------------

The
literature
online
relating
particularly
to
the
oxymoronic
concept
of
an
evil
conscience
emanates
mostly
from
theology—and
we
'
ll
deal
with
this
orientation
first
.


The
approach
that
fundamentalist
religion
takes
toward
ethics
is
absolutist
,
placing
a
person
'
s
behavior
into
neat
,
---------------
all
of
its
supporting
evidence
from
Scriptures
,
Greg
Stuckey
defines
any
human
wrongdoing
as—purely
and
simply—evil
.


So
anyone
afflicted
with
such
a
presumed
immoral
conscience
will
experience
as
good
what
the
Bible
delineates
as
evil
,
and
vice
versa
.



---------------
precisely
what
they
should
be
ashamed
of
.


Rather
than
feeling
troubled
by
hurting
others
,
they
perversely
take
joy
in
it
.


Looked
at
from
this
dogmatic
ecclesiastical
stance
,
an
evil
conscience
is
synonymous
with
sinning
against
God—and
it
requires
paying
penance
to
God
if
one
is
to
be
forgiven
.

A
conscience
is
a
cognitive
process
that
elicits
emotion
and
rational
associations
based
on
an
individual
'
s
moral
philosophy
or
value
system
.


Conscience
stands
in
contrast
to
elicited
emotion
or
thought
due
to
associations
based
on
immediate
sensory
perceptions
and
reflexive
responses
,
as
in
sympathetic
central
nervous
system
responses

In
common
terms
,
conscience
is
often
described
as
leading

remorse
when
a
person
commits
an
act
that
conflicts
with

which
conscience

The
Islamic
concept
of
Taqwa
is
closely
related
to
conscience
.


In
the
Qur’ān
verses
2
:197
&
22

Taqwa
refers
to
"right

"piety"

The
Awakening
Conscience
,
Holman
Hunt
,
1853

In
the
Protestant
Christian
tradition
,
Martin
Luther
insisted
in
the
Diet
of
Worms
that
his
conscience
was
captive
to
the
Word
of
God
,
and
it
was
neither
safe
nor
right
to
go
against
conscience
.


To
Luther
,
conscience
falls
within
the
ethical
,
rather
than
the
religious
,
sphere
.


^
(
[25
]
)
John
Calvin
saw
conscience
as
a
battleground
:
"the
enemies
who
rise
up
in
our
conscience
against
his
Kingdom
and
hinder
his
decrees
prove
that
God
'
s
throne
is
not
firmly
established
therein"
.


^
(
[26
]
)
Many
Christians
regard
following
one
'
s
conscience
as
important
as
,
or
even
more
important
than
,
obeying
human
authority
.


^
(

According
to
the
bible
,
written
in
Romans
2
:15
,
conscience
is
the
one
bearing
witness
,
accusing
or
excusing

another

so
we
would
know
when
we
break
the
law

This
dilemma
of
obedience
in
conscience
to
divine
or
state
law
,
was
demonstrated
dramatically
in
Antigone
'
s
defiance
of
King
Creon

against
burying
her
brother

Catholic
theology
sees
conscience
as
the
last
practical
"judgment
of
reason
which
at
the
appropriate
moment
enjoins
[a
person
]
to
do
good
and
to
avoid
evil"
.


^
(
[33
]
)
The
Second
Vatican
Council
(1962–65
)
describes
:
"Deep
within
his
conscience
man
discovers
a
law
which
he
has
not
laid
upon
himself
but
which
he
must
obey
.


Its
voice
,
ever
calling
him
to
love
and
to
do
what
is
good
and
to
avoid
evil
,
tells
him
inwardly
at
the
right
movement
:
do
this
,
shun
that
.


For
man
has
in
his
heart
a
law
inscribed
by
God
.


His
dignity
lies
in
observing
this
law
,
and
by
it
he
will
be
judged
.


His
conscience
is
man’s
most
secret
core
,
and
his
sanctuary
.


There
he
is
alone
with
God
whose
voice
echoes
in
his
depths
.

"
^
(
[34
]
)
Thus
,
conscience
is
not
like
the
will
,
nor
a
habit
like
prudence
,
but
"the
interior
space
in
which
we
can
listen
to
and
hear
the
truth
,
the
good
,
the
voice
of
God
.


It
is
the
inner
place
of
our
---------------
to
understand
the
path
we
ought
to
take
,
and
once
the
decision
is
made
,
to
move
forward
,
to
remain
faithful"
^
(
[35
]
)
In
terms
of
logic
,
conscience
can
be
viewed
as
the
practical
conclusion
of
a
moral
syllogism
whose
major
premise
is
an
objective
norm
and
whose
minor
premise
is
a
particular
case
or
situation
to
which
the
norm
is
applied
.


Thus
,
Catholics
are
taught
to
carefully
educate
themselves
as
to
revealed
norms
and
norms
derived
therefrom
,
so
as
to
form
a
correct
conscience
.


Catholics
are
also
to
examine
their
conscience
daily
and
with
special
care
before
confession
.


Catholic
teaching
holds
that
,
"Man
has
the
right
to
act
according
to
his
conscience
and
in
freedom
so
as
personally
to
make
moral
decisions
.


He
must
not
be
forced
to
act
contrary
to
his
conscience
.


Nor
must
he
be
prevented
from
acting
according
to
his
conscience
,
especially
in
religious
matters"
.


^
(
[36
]
)
This
right
of
conscience
does
not
allow
one
to
arbitrarily
disagree
with
Church
teaching
and
claim
that
one
is
acting
in
accordance
with
conscience
.


A
sincere
conscience
presumes
one
is
diligently
seeking
moral
truth
from
authentic
sources
,
that
is
,
seeking
to
conform
oneself
to
that
moral
truth
by
listening
to
the
authority
established
by
Christ
to
teach
it
.


Nevertheless
,
despite
one
'
s
best
effort
,
"
[i
]t
can
happen
that
moral
conscience
remains
in
ignorance
and
makes
erroneous
judgments
about
acts
to
be
performed
or
already
committed 
.


.


.


This
ignorance
can
often
be
imputed
to
personal
responsibility 
.


.


.


In
such
cases
,
the
person
is
culpable
for
the
wrong
he
commits
.

"
^
(
[37
]
)
Thus
,
if
one
realizes
one
may
have
made
a
mistaken
judgment
,
one
'
s
conscience
is
said
to
be
vincibly
erroneous
and
it
is
not
a
valid
norm
for
action
.


One
must
first
remove
the
source
of
error
and
do
one
'
s
best
to
achieve
a
correct
judgment
.


If
,
however
,
one
is
not
aware
of
one
'
s
error
or
if
,
despite
an
honest
and
diligent
effort
one
cannot
remove
the
error
by
study
or
seeking
advice
,
then
one
'
s
conscience
may
be
said
to
be
invincibly
erroneous
.


It
binds
since
one
has
subjective
certainty
that
one
is
correct
.


The
act
resulting
from
acting
on
the
invincibly
erroneous
conscience
is
not
good
in
itself
,
yet
this
deformed
act
or
material
sin
against
God
'
s
right
order
and
the
objective
norm
is
not
imputed
to
the
person
.


The
formal
obedience
given
to
such
a
judgment
of
conscience
is
good
.


Some
Catholics
appeal
to
conscience
in
order
to
justify
dissent
,
not
on
the
level
of
conscience
properly
understood
,
but
on
the
level
of
the
principles
and
norms
which
are
supposed
to
inform
conscience
.


For
example
,
some
priests
make
on
the
use
of
the
so-called
internal
forum
solution
(which
is
not
sanctioned
by

Charles
Darwin
thought
that
any
animal
endowed
with
well-marked
social
instincts
would
inevitably
acquire
a
moral
sense
or
conscience
,
as
its
intellectual
powers

The

,
physiological
,
sociological
,
humanitarian
,
and
authoritarian
views
.

(

Lawrence
Kohlberg
considered
critical
conscience
to
be
an
important
psychological
stage
in
the
proper
moral
development
of
humans
,
associated
with
the
capacity
to
rationally
weigh
principles
of
---------------
humorous
personifications
(such
as
Jiminy
Cricket
)
and
later
in
adolescents
by
debates
about
individually
pertinent
moral
dilemmas
.

(

Erik
Erikson
placed
the
development
of
conscience
in

phase

stages

Thus
a
good
conscience
is
associated

feelings

integrity
,
psychological
wholeness

peacefulness

adjectives
such
as
"quiet"
,
"clear"
and

.

(

Sigmund
Freud
regarded
conscience
as
originating
psychologically
from
the
growth
of
civilisation
,
which
periodically
frustrated
the
external
expression
of
aggression
:
this
destructive
impulse
being
forced
to
seek
---------------
against
the
person
'
s
own
"ego"
or
selfishness
(often
taking
its
cue
in
this
regard
from
parents
during
childhood
)
.


^
(
[58

)
According
to
Freud
,
the
consequence
of
not
obeying
our
conscience
is
guilt
,
which
can
be
a
factor
in
the
development
of
neurosis
;
Freud
claimed
that
both
the
cultural
and
individual
super-ego
set
up
strict
ideal
demands
with
regard
to
the
moral
aspects
of
certain
decisions
,
disobedience
to
which
provokes
a

'
fear

Antonio
Damasio
considers
conscience
an
aspect

Conscience
as
a
society-forming
instinct


[edit

---------------

Jeremy
Bentham
:
"Fanaticism
never

it
is
never
stopped
by
conscience
;
for
it
has
pressed

into
its

.

"

Michel
Glautier
argues
that
conscience
is
one
of
the
instincts
and
drives
which
enable
people
to
form
societies
:
groups
of
humans
without
these
drives
or
in
whom
they
are
insufficient
cannot
form
societies
and
---------------

War
criminal
Adolf
Eichmann
in
passport
used
to
enter
Argentina
:
his
conscience
spoke
with
the
"respectable
voice"
of
the
indoctrinated
wartime
German
society
that
surrounded
him
.



Charles
Darwin
considered
that
conscience
evolved
in
humans
to
resolve
conflicts
between
competing
natural
impulses-some
about
self-preservation
but
others
about
safety
of
a
family
or
community
;
the
claim
of
conscience
to
moral
authority
emerged
from
the
"greater
duration
of
impression
of
social
instincts"
in
the
struggle
for
survival
.


^
(
[62
]
)
In
such
a
view
,
behavior
destructive
to
a
person
'
s
society
(either
to
its
structures
or
to
the
persons
it
comprises
)
is
bad
or
"evil"
.


^
(
[63
]
)
Thus
,
conscience
can
be
viewed
as
an
outcome
of
those
biological
drives
that
prompt
humans
to
avoid
provoking
fear
or
contempt
in
others
;
being
experienced
as
guilt
and
shame
in
differing
ways
from
society
to
society
and
person
to
person
.


^
(
[64
]
)
A
requirement
of
conscience
in
this
view
is
the
capacity
to
see
ourselves
from
the
point
of
view
of
another
person
.


^
(
[65
]
)
Persons
unable
to
do
this

(psychopaths
,
sociopaths
,
narcissists
)
therefore
often
act
in
ways
which
are
"evil"
.


^
(
[66
]
)

Fundamental
in
this
view
of
conscience
is
that
humans
consider
some
"other"
as
being
in
a
social
relationship
.


Thus
,
nationalism
is
invoked
in
conscience
to
quell
tribal
conflict
and
the
notion
of
a
Brotherhood
of
Man
is
invoked
to
quell
national
conflicts
.


Yet
such
crowd
drives
may
not
only
overwhelm
but
redefine
individual
conscience
.


Friedrich
Nietzsche
stated
:
"communal
solidarity
is
annihilated
by
the
highest
and
strongest
drives
that
,
when
they
break
out
passionately
,
whip
the
individual
far
past
the
average
low
level
of
the

Moral

The
word
"conscience"
derives
etymologically
from
the
Latin
conscientia
,
meaning
"privity
of
knowledge"
^
(
[83

or
"with-knowledge"

English
word
implies
internal
awareness

consciousness

Conscience
in
this
sense
is
not
necessarily
the
product
of
a
process
of
rational
consideration
of
the
moral
features
of
a
situation

(or
the
applicable
normative
principles

rules

can
arise
from

Conscience

critical

The
Flemish
mystic
Jan
van
Ruysbroeck
viewed
a
pure
conscience
as
facilitating
"an
outflowing
losing
of
oneself
in
the
abyss
of
that
eternal
object
which
is
the
highest
and
chief
blessedness"
.



Some
medieval
Christian
scholastics
such
as
Bonaventure
made
a
distinction
between
conscience
as
a
rational
faculty
of
the
mind

(practical
reason
)
and
inner
awareness
,
an
intuitive
"spark"
to
do
good
,
called
synderesis
arising
from
a
remnant
appreciation
of
absolute
good
---------------
becoming
a
source
of
inner
torment
.


^
(
[89

)
Early
modern
theologians
such
as
William
Perkins
and
William
Ames
developed
a
syllogistic
understanding
of
the
conscience
,
where
God
'
s
law
made
the
first
term
,
the
act
to
be
judged
the
second
and
the
action
of
the
conscience
(as
a
rational
faculty
)
produced
the
judgement
.


By
debating
test
cases
applying
such
understanding
conscience
was
trained
and
refined
(i

)
.


^
(

---------------
The
medieval
Persian
philosopher
Ibn
Sina
(Avicenna
)
developed
a
sensory
deprivation
thought
experiment
to
explore
the
relationship
between
conscience
and
God
.



In
the
13th
century
,
St
.


Thomas
Aquinas
regarded
conscience
as
the
application
of
moral
knowledge
to
a
particular
case
(S
.

.


I
,
q

,

)
.


Thus
,
conscience
was
considered
an
act
or
judgment
of
practical
reason
that
began
with
synderesis
,
the
structured
development
of
our
innate
remnant
awareness
of
absolute
good
(which
he
categorised
as
involving
the
five
primary
precepts
proposed
in
his
theory
of
Natural
Law
)
into
an
acquired
habit
of
applying
moral
principles
.


^
(
[50
]
)
According
to
Singer
,
Aquinas
held
that
conscience
,
or
conscientia
was
an
imperfect
process
of
judgment
applied
to
activity
because
knowledge
of
the
natural
law
(and
all
acts
of
natural
virtue
implicit
therein
)
was
obscured
in
most
people
by
education
and
custom
that
promoted
selfishness
rather
than
fellow-feeling
(Summa
Theologiae
,
I–II
,
I
)
.


^
(
[94
]
)
Aquinas
also
discussed
conscience
in
relation
to
the
virtue
of
prudence
to
explain
why
some
people
appear
to
be
less
"morally
enlightened"
than
others
,
their
weak
will
being
incapable
of
adequately
balancing
their
own
needs
with
those
of
others
.


^
(
[95
]
)

Aquinas
reasoned
that
acting
contrary
to
conscience
is
an
evil
action
but
an
errant
conscience
is
only
blameworthy
if
it
is
the
result
of
culpable
or
vincible
ignorance
of
factors
that
one
has
a
duty
to
have
knowledge
of
.


^
(
[94
]
)
Aquinas
also
argued
that
conscience
should
be
educated
to
act
towards
real
goods
(from
God
)
which
encouraged
human
flourishing
,
rather
than
the
apparent
goods
of
sensory
pleasures
.


^
(
[94

)
---------------
Thomas
A
Kempis
in
the
medieval
contemplative
classic
The
Imitation
of
Christ
(ca
1418
)
stated
that
the
glory
of
a
good
man
is
the
witness
of
a
good
conscience
.


"Preserve
a
quiet
conscience
and
you
will
always
have
joy
.


A
quiet
conscience
can
endure
much
,
and
remains
joyful
in
all
trouble
,
but
an
evil
conscience
is
always
fearful
and
uneasy
.

"
^
(
[97

)
The
anonymous
medieval
author
of
the
Christian
mystical
work
The
Cloud
of
Unknowing
similarly
expressed
the
view
that

conscience
.

"
^
(
[98

)
The
medieval
Flemish
mystic
John
of
Ruysbroeck
likewise
held
that
true
conscience
has
four
aspects
that
are
necessary
to
render
a
man
just
in
the
active
and
contemplative
life
:
"a

Schopenhauer
considered
that

experience

person

thought
produced
by
emotions
and
to
fall
in

with
viewing

decision
from

perspective

.


^
(
[101

)
Thus
,
living
a
life
of
peaceful
conscience
means
to
Spinoza
that
reason
is
used
to
generate
adequate
ideas
where
the
mind
increasingly
sees
the
world
and
its
conflicts
,
our
desires
and
passions
sub
specie
aeternitatis
,
that
is
without
reference
to
time
.


^
(
[102
]
)
Hegel
'
s
obscure
and
mystical
Philosophy
of
Mind
held
that
the
absolute
right
of
freedom
of
conscience
facilitates
human
understanding
of
an
all-embracing
unity
,
an
absolute
which
was
rational
,
real
and
true
.


^
(
[103
]
)
Nevertheless
,
Hegel
thought
that
a
functioning
State
would
always
be
tempted
not
to
recognize
conscience
in
its
form
of
subjective
knowledge
,
just
as
similar
non-objective
opinions
are
generally
rejected
in
science
.


^
(
[104
]
)
A
similar
idealist
notion
was
expressed
in
the
writings
of
Joseph
Butler
who
argued
that
conscience
is
God-given
,
should
always
be
obeyed
,
is
intuitive
,
and
should
be
considered
the
"constitutional
monarch"
and
the
"universal
moral
faculty"
:
"conscience
does
not
only
offer
itself
to
show
us
the
way
we
should
walk
in
,
but
it
likewise
carries
its
own
authority
with
it
.

"
^
(
[105
]
)
Butler
advanced
ethical
speculation
by
referring
to
a
duality
of
regulative
principles
in
human
nature
:
first
,
"self-love"
(seeking
individual
happiness
)
and
second
,
"benevolence"
(compassion
and
seeking
good
for
another
)
in
conscience

(also
linked
to
the
agape
of
situational
ethics
)
.


^
(
[51
]
)
Conscience
tended
to
be
more
authoritative
in
questions
of
moral
judgment
,
thought
Butler
,
because
it
was
more
likely
to
be
clear
and
certain
(whereas
calculations
of
self-interest
tended
to
probable
and
changing
conclusions
)
.

John
Selden
in
his
Table
Talk
expressed
the
view
that
an
awake
but
excessively
scrupulous
or
ill-trained
conscience
could
hinder
resolve
and
practical
action
;
it
being
"like

translations

influenced
philosophers

Schopenhauer
to
hold
that
in
a
healthy
mind
only
deeds
oppress
our

not
wishes
and
thoughts
;
"for
it

only
our

;
the
good
conscience

thought
Schopenhauer
,
we
experience
after
every
disinterested
deed
arises
from
direct

of
our
own

^
(

Kant
considered
critical
conscience
to
be
an
internal
court
in
which
our
thoughts
accuse
or
excuse
one
another
;
he
acknowledged
that
morally
mature
people
do
often
describe
contentment
or
peace
in
the
soul
after
following
conscience
to
perform
a
duty
,
but
argued
that
for
such
acts
to
produce
virtue
their
primary
motivation
should
simply
be
duty
,
not
expectation
of
any
such
bliss
.


^
(
[111

)
Rousseau
expressed
a
similar
view
that
conscience
somehow
connected
man
to
a
greater
metaphysical
unity
.


John
Plamenatz
in
his
critical
examination
of
Rousseau
'
s
work
considered
that
conscience
was
there
defined
as
the
feeling
that

John
Locke
in
his
Essays
on
the
Law
of
Nature
argued
that
the
widespread
fact
of
human
conscience
allowed
a
philosopher
to
infer
the
necessary
existence
of
objective
moral
laws
that
occasionally
might
contradict

Locke
highlighted
the
metaethics
problem
of
whether
accepting
a
statement
like
"follow
your
conscience"
supports
subjectivist
or
objectivist
conceptions
of
conscience
as
a
guide
in
concrete
morality
,
or
as
a
spontaneous
revelation
of
eternal
and
immutable
principles
to
the
individual
:
"if
conscience
be
a
proof
of
innate
principles
,
contraries
may
be
innate
principles
;
since
some
men
with
the
same
bent
of
conscience
prosecute
what
others
avoid
.

"

Thomas
Hobbes
likewise
pragmatically
noted
that
opinions
formed
on
the
basis
of
conscience
with
full
and
honest
conviction
,
nevertheless
should
always
be
accepted
with
humility
as
potentially
erroneous
and
not
necessarily
indicating
absolute
knowledge

William

expressed
the
view

a

consequence

into

Adam

considered

developing

John

believed
that
idealism
about
the
role
of

in
government
should
be
tempered

on
a

feeling

(
[119

Mill
held
that
certain
amount
of
conscience
,
and
of
disinterested
public
spirit

may
fairly
be
calculated
on
in
the
citizens
of
any
community
ripe
for

---------------

Josiah
Royce
(1855–1916
)
built
on
the
transcendental
idealism
view
of
conscience
,
viewing
it
as
the
ideal
of
life
which
constitutes
our
moral
personality
,
our
plan
of
being
ourself
,
of
making
common
sense
ethical
decisions
.


But
,
he
thought
,
this
was
only
true
insofar
as
our
conscience
also
required
loyalty
to
"a
mysterious
higher
or
deeper
self"
.


^
(
[120
]
)
In
the
modern
Christian
tradition
this
approach
achieved
expression
with
Dietrich
Bonhoeffer
who
stated
during
his
imprisonment
by
the
Nazis
in
World
War
II
that
conscience
for
him
was
more
than
practical
reason
,
indeed
it
came
from
a
"depth
which
lies
beyond
a
man
'
s
own
will
and
his
own
reason
and
it
makes
itself
heard
as
the
call
of
human
existence
to
unity
with
itself
.

"
^
(
[121

)
For
Bonhoeffer
a
guilty
conscience
arose
as
an
indictment
of
the
loss
of
this
unity
and
as
a
warning
against
the
loss
of
one
'
s
self
;
primarily
,
he
thought
,
it
is
directed
not
towards
a
particular
kind
of
doing
but
towards
a
particular
mode
of
being
.


It
protests
against
a
doing
which
imperils
the
unity
of
this
being
with
itself
.


^
(
[52

)
Conscience
for
Bonhoeffer
did
not
,
like
shame
,
embrace
or
pass
judgment
on
the
morality
of
the
whole
of
its
owner
'
s
life
;
it
reacted
only
to
certain
definite
actions
:
"it
recalls
what
is
long
past
and
represents
this
disunion
as
something
which
is
already
accomplished
and
irreparable"
.


^
(
[122

The
man
with
a
conscience
,
he
believed
,
fights
a
lonely
battle
against
the
"overwhelming
forces
of
inescapable
situations"
which
demand
moral
decisions
despite
the
likelihood
of
---------------
that
the
truth
distributed
in
the
world
,
as
the
statement
about
human
dignity
,
as
the
affirmation
of
the
line
between
good
and
evil

lives
in

As
Hannah
Arendt
pointed
out
,
however
,
(following
the
utilitarian
John
Stuart
Mill
on
this
point
)
:
a
bad
conscience
does
not
necessarily
signify
a
bad
character
;
in
fact
only
those
who
affirm
a
commitment
to
applying
moral
standards
will
be
troubled
with
remorse
,
guilt
or
shame
by
a
bad
conscience
and
their
need
to
regain
integrity
and
wholeness
of
the
self
.

(
[124

[125

Representing
our
soul
or
true
self
by
analogy
as
our
house
,
Arendt
wrote
that
"conscience
is
the
anticipation

the
fellow
who
awaits
you
if
and
when
you
come
home
.

"
^
(

Arendt
believed
that
people
who
are
unfamiliar
with

process
of
silent

"count

bad
people
are
not
full

regrets

Arendt
also
wrote
eloquently
on
the
problem
of
languages
distinguishing
the
word
consciousness
from

One
reason
,
she
held
,
was
that

it

Albert

associated

thoughts
,
feelings
and
aspirations

Albert
Einstein
,
as
a
self-professed
adherent
of
humanism
and
rationalism

likewise
viewed
an
enlightened
religious
person
as
one
whose
conscience
reflects
that
he
"has

his
ability

liberated
himself

he
clings
---------------
liberty
,
obligations
should
take
precedence
over
rights
in
moral
and
political
philosophy
and
a
spiritual
awakening
should
occur
in
the
conscience
of
most
citizens
,
so
that
social
obligations
are
viewed
as
fundamentally
having
a
transcendent
origin
and
a

on

Simone
Weil
also
in
that
work
provided
a
psychological
explanation
for
the
mental
peace
associated
with
a
good
conscience
:
"the
liberty
of
men
of
goodwill
,
though
limited
in
the
sphere
of
action
,
is
complete
in
that
of
conscience
.

into

themselves

Alternatives
to
such
metaphysical
and
idealist
opinions
about

arose
from
realist

materialist
perspectives
such
as
those
of
Charles
Darwin

Darwin
suggested
that
"any

whatever
,
endowed
with
well-marked
social
instincts
,
the
parental
and
filial
affections
being
here
included
,
would
inevitably
acquire
a
moral
sense

conscience
,
as
soon
as
its
intellectual
powers
had
become
as

,
or
as

Michael

claimed
that
the
growth

arose

from
the

recognition
that

also
argued

Ronald

maintains

constitutional
protection

to
it
:
"Freedom

it
loses
much
of

the

it
encouraged
our

of
assuming
things

that
selfish
freedom
of
will
"does
not

that
realising
this
has
a

purpose

Samuel

pointed
out
that

should
not
allow
the

to
bring
unjust
suffering
upon

Conscience
,
according

Johnson

was
nothing
more
than
a
conviction
felt
by
ourselves
of
something
to
be
done
or
something
to
be
avoided
;
in
questions
of
simple
unperplexed
morality
,
conscience
is
very
often
a
guide
that
may
be
trusted
.

But
before
conscience
can
conclusively
determine
what
morally
should
be
done
,
he
thought
that

state
of
the
question
should
be
thoroughly
known
.

"No

conscience"

said
Johnson
"can
tell
him

right

it
is

ill
informed
that
violates

The
critic
A

C

Bradley
discusses
the
central
problem
of
Shakespeare
'
s
tragic
character
Hamlet
as
one
where
conscience
in
the
form
of
moral
scruples
deters
the
young
Prince
with
his
"great
anxiety
to
do
right"
from
obeying
his
father
'
s
hell-bound
ghost
and
murdering

King

Bradley
develops
a
theory
about
Hamlet
'
s
moral
agony
relating
to
a
conflict
between
"traditional"
and
"critical"
conscience
:
"The
conventional
moral
ideas
of
his
time
,
which
he
shared
with
the
Ghost
,
told
him
plainly
that
he
ought
to
avenge
his
father
;
but
a
deeper
conscience
in
him
,
which
was
in
advance
of
his
time
,
contended
with
these
explicit
conventional
ideas
.


It
is
because
this
deeper
conscience
remains
below
the
surface
that
he
fails
to
recognise
it
,
and
fancies
he
is
hindered
by
cowardice
or
sloth
or
passion
or
what
not
;
but
it
emerges

words
of
Shakespeare

Sonnet

("They
that
have

Types
of
Conscience

Text
:
1
Timothy
1
:5

One
of
the
goals
of
preaching/teaching
the
word
of
God
is
a
“good
conscience
.

”
Our
conscience
is
designed
to
help
guide
us
to
do
what
is
right
(“right”
depends
on
how
it
is
trained
)
.


If
we
want
to
accomplish
this
goal
,
we
need
to
understand
more
about
the
conscience
.


There
are
at
least
six
different
types
of
conscience
addressed
in
the
New
Testament
.


We
will
consider
them
here
.



Good
Conscience

-
A good
conscience
is
one
which
is
free
from
guilt
–
we
are
doing

what
we
believe
to
be
right
;
used
two
different
ways
in
the
NT
(of

those
who
did
right
and
those
who
did
wrong
)
-
Those
who
do
right
are
to
have
a good
conscience
(1
Timothy
1
:5
)
–

keep
a
good
conscience
(1
Timothy
1
:19
)
;
if
we
follow
God
,
we
can

have
confidence
,
not
fear
(1
John
3
:21
;
2
:28-29
)
-
However
,
it
is
possible
to
do wrong
and
have
a good
conscience
(Acts

23
:1
)
–
Paul
did
many
things
against
Christ
(Acts
26
:9-11
;
1
Timothy

1
:13-15
)
;
he
believed
he
was
right
(Acts
24
:16
)
-
Many
have
a good
conscience
because
they
do
what
“seems
right”
to

them
(Proverbs
14
:12
)
–
but
this
is
not
enough

Defiled
Conscience

-
A defiled
conscience
is
one
which
causes
one
to
feel
guilt
for
doing

what
is
either
right
or
innocent
– right
is
something
required
by

God
(2
Timothy
3
:16-17
)
; innocent
is
not
right
or
wrong
in
itself

(Romans
14
:2-3
)
-
In
Corinth
,
some
had
a defiled
conscience
(1
Corinthians
8
:7
)
–
much

of
the
meat
sold
in
the
markets
in
Corinth
had
been
used
previously

in
idol
worship
;
Paul
explained
that
buying/eating
it
did
not
---------------
-
However
,
those
“accustomed
to
the
idol”
could
not
separate
the
idol

worship
from
eating
(1
Corinthians
8
:7
)
–
for
them
,
to
eat
would

violate
their
conscience
and
embolden
them
to
sin
(1
Corinthians

8
:10-11
;
cf
.


Romans
14
:23
)
-
If
one
has
a defiled
conscience
,
they
need
to
be
patiently
taught

the
truth
(Romans
14
:1
;
cf
.


Acts
18
:26
)

Seared
Conscience

-
A seared
conscience
is
one
that
no
longer
feels
guilt
for
sin
–

whether
one
followed
the
right
or
wrong
standard
,
it
is
a
conscience

that
has
been
violated
so
many
times
that
it
no
longer
works
-
The
Spirit
warned
of
those
who
would
fall
away
due
to
a seared

conscience
(1
Timothy
4
:1-2
)
–
when
one
sins
,
godly
sorrow
leads
him

to
repentance
(2
Corinthians
7
:10
)
;
feels
guilty
,
wants
to
be
right
-
But
when
sin
becomes persistent
and
habitual
,
guilt
is
no
longer

there
(Genesis
6
:5
;
Jeremiah
6
:15
)
-
A seared
conscience
is
prevented
by
laying
aside
sin
(Hebrews
12
:1
)

rather
than
continuing
in
it
(2
Timothy
3
:13
)
–
if
one
has
a seared

conscience
,
little
can
be
done
until
they
have
a
change
of
heart

(Hebrews
6
:4-6
)

Weak
Conscience

-
A weak
conscience
is
one
that
has
simply
not
been
trained
in
what
is

right
–
lacks
knowledge
from
God
that
provides
the
right
standard
-
In
Corinth
,
a weak
conscience
led
to
a defiled
conscience
(1

Corinthians
8
:7
)
–
lacked
knowledge
;
one
can
have
a weak
conscience

and
also
have
a good
conscience
(Acts
23
:1
;
1
Timothy
1
:13
)
-
The
remedy
for
a
weak
conscience
is training
in
the
word
of
God

(Hebrews
5
:14
)

Evil
Conscience

-
An evil
conscience
is
one
that
has
not
been
forgiven
of
sin
(Hebrews

10
:22
)
-
All
have
had
an evil
conscience
at
some
point
(Romans
3
:23
)
–

forgiveness
is
found
in
Christ
(Hebrews
9
:14
;
Ephesians
1
:7
)
;
this

cleanses
the evil
conscience

Clear
(Pure
)
Conscience

-
A clear
(pure
,
KJV
)
conscience
is
one
that
has
been
forgiven
(1

Timothy
3
:9
)
–
cleansed
by
Christ
;
this
is
the good
conscience
of

those
who
do
right
(1
Timothy
1
:5
,
19
;
1
Peter
3
:16
)
-
We
cannot
purify
our
conscience
on
our
own
–
must
appeal
to
God
to

do
it
(1
Peter
3
:21
)
-
God
cleanses
us
when
we
obey
the
gospel
(Romans
6
:3-4
)
–
continues
---------------
Conclusion

-
The
goal
of
our
instruction
is
a
“good
conscience”
–
but
goodness
is

by
God’s
standard
,
not
man’s
-
It
is
not
enough
for
us
to
think
we
are
doing
what
is
right
–
we

must
actually
be
right
;
involves
knowledge
,
obedience
,
and

forgiveness
-
We
can
have
“our
hearts
sprinkled
clean
from
an
evil
conscience”

(Hebrews
10
:22
)
–
done
in
baptism
;
appeal
for
a
good
conscience
(1

Peter
3
:21
)
;
receive
forgiveness
(Acts
22
:16
)

are
the

.




[Study

November

Our
inherent
nature
of
an
evil
conscience
knows
to
do
good
and
doesn’t
.


Such
a
one
rightly
divides
the
truth
from
error
and
is
bewitched
to
disobediently
choose
error
.




1Pe
3
:15 
But
sanctify
the
Lord
God
in
your
hearts
[where
conscience

resides
]
:
and
be
ready
always
to
give
an
answer
to
every
man
that

asketh
you
a
reason
of
the
hope
that
is
in
you
with
meekness
and
fear

[prompted
by
a
good
conscience
.


How
?


]
:

1Pe
3
:16 
Having
a
good
conscience
;
that
,
whereas
they
speak
evil
of

you
,
as
of
evildoers
,
they
may
be
ashamed
that
falsely
accuse
your

good
conversation
in
Christ
.




Heb
10
:22
Let
us
draw
near
with
a
true
heart
in
full
assurance
of

faith
,
having
our
hearts
sprinkled
from
an
evil
conscience
,
and
our

bodies
washed
with
pure
water
.



Hebrews
10
:22
is
the
only
verse
in
the
Bible
that
directly
refers
to
an
“evil
conscience
.

”
However
,
as
previously
pointed
out
,
the
Bible
abounds
with
stark
nuances
of
both
forms
of
a
good
or
evil
conscience
.


It
is
impossible
to
speak
about
specific
evil
consciences
without
juxtaposing
them
with
their
corresponding
good
conscience
.



As
we
have
seen
in
the
preceding
studies
,
a
‘good
conscience’
is
dramatically
differentiated
by
Adam
and
Eve
partaking
of
the
Tree
of
the
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
.


Subsequently
,
a
pandora’s
box
of
evil
conscience
blooms
like
leavening
in
bread
dough
.



As
such
,
Mr
Barid’s
order
of
sixteen
headings
for
his
conscience
study
does
not
descend
in
order
of
authority
,
but
rather
it
is
in
order
of
scriptural
reference
.

An
Abandoned
Conscience

Our
study
today
is
on
an
“Evil
Conscience”
,
yet
when
we
review
the
above
headings
,
the
vast
majority
of
them
are
all
aspects
of
an
evil
conscience
.


Nonetheless
,
it
is
the
Saint’s
God-given
passion
to
study
every
detail
of
His
word
,
leaving
nothing
alive
that
breathes
of
misunderstanding
and
thus
our
continuation
of
the
sixteen
mostly
evil
versions
of
our
conscience
.



Clearly
,
Adam
and
Cain
within
us
initiated
the
many
forms
of
evil
consciences
,
yet
the
first
time
the
term
is
directly
used
is
in
Hebrews
10
:22
,
the
entire
Bible
bleeding
defiled
evil
consciences
from
the
beginning
to
near
the
end
.



Hebrews
10
admonishes
us
to
remain
faithful
to
the
New
Covenant
in
Christ
and
not
regress
to
the
Laws
of
Moses
so
etched
in
our
hearts
that
we
temporarily
battle
a
dual
of
tortured
consciences
as
Paul
did
regarding
circumcision
.



---------------

Heb
10
:20 
By
a
new
and
living
way
[one
that
literally
leads
to
life

eternal
]
,
which
he
hath
consecrated
for
us
,
through
the
veil
,
that
is

to
say
,
his
flesh
[revealing
the
path
to
a
more
excellent
conscience
]
;

Heb
10
:21 
And
having
an
high
priest
over
the
house
of
God
;

Heb
10
:22 
Let
us
draw
near
with
a
true
heart
in
full
assurance
of

faith
,
having
our
hearts
sprinkled
[a
sprinkle
(little
by
little
)
is

the
beginning
of
a
storm
,
a
flood
of
truth
]
from
an
evil
conscience
,

and
our
bodies
washed
with
pure
water
.



Heb
10
:23 
Let
us
hold
fast
the
[new
]
profession
of
our
faith
without
---------------
spirit
and
in
truth
.


Formally
,
Israel
worshiped
God
by
attempting
to
keep
His
laws
through
physical
washings
and
sacrifices
that
most
certainly
caused
His
people
a
good
conscience
via
those
laws
.


Yet
,
as
depicted
by
Saul
,
who
became
Paul
,
his
pricked
conscience
while
under
the
slavery
of
the
Old
Covenant
was
subliminally
aware
of
a
strange
new
conscience
opposing
most
turbulently
his
established
beliefs
.


Paul’s
boldness
became
dramatically
evident
through
his
earthquake
of
miraculous
blindness
as
he
whimpered
,
‘”Who
art
thou
,
Lord
?

”
And
the
---------------
against
the
pricks
.

’
(Acts
9
)

Paul’s
conscience
was
kicking
against
the
pricks
of
his
murderous
ways
and
imploring
eyes
staring
back
at
him
upon
his
many
stonings
as
he
demanded
the
church
of
the
day
adhere
to
Moses’s
laws
;
subliminally
,
he
---------------
worship
of
God
by
the
same
laws
,
only
by
spirit
and
not
by
sweat
.


It
was
a
shift
in
how
each
of
us
now
perceived
what
constituted
an
‘evil
conscience’
and
was
earth-shattering
.


That
seismic
shift
in
how
to
live
by
the
Law
was
quickly
realized
to
be
immensely
liberating
.


Its
overpowering
joy
eclipsed
martyrdom
,
as
Steven
exemplified
in
Acts
7
.


---------------

tribe
Moses
spake
nothing
concerning
priesthood
.



Unlike
Paul
,
Moses
wasn’t
given
or
ready
to
have
his
conscience
pricked
by
a
better
conscience
by
the
holy
spirit…


Heb
7
:15 
And
it
is
yet
far
more
evident
:
for
that
after
the
---------------

unchangeable
priesthood
.



…
governed
by
a
pure
conscience
.

 


Heb
7
:25 
Wherefore
he
is
able
also
to
save
them
to
the
uttermost
that
---------------

them
.



Heb
7
:26 
For
such
an
high
priest
became
us
,
who
is
holy
,
harmless
[a

pure
conscience
casts
out
all
fear
]
,
undefiled
,
separate
from
sinners
,

and
made
higher
than
the
heavens
; 

Heb
7
:27 
Who
needeth
not
daily
,
as
those
high
priests
,
to
offer
up
---------------

is
consecrated
for
evermore
.

 

Hebrews
7
highlights
the
most
profound
shift
of
a
good
conscience
to
a
means
to
attain
a
pure
conscience
through
Christ
,
our
High
Priest
.


Stephen
was
so
committed
to
the
spirit
of
a
‘good
conscience’
of
greater
purity
that
he
was
willing
to
be
martyred
.


Stephen
,
Christ
and
all
the
martyrs
of
old
,
all
died
having
acted
in
good
faith
in
accordance
with
their
consciences
defying
an
‘evil
conscience’
,
and
so
,
too
,
does
the
Bride
of
Christ
.


From
that
foundation
arises
the
focus
of
this
study
and
our
immovable
confidence…


Heb
10
:22 
Let
us
draw
near
with
a
true
heart
in
full
assurance
of

faith
,
having
our
hearts
sprinkled
from
an
evil
conscience
,
and
our

bodies
washed
with
pure
water
.



---------------
Temple
he
is
constructing
.



The
following
scriptures
annul
an
evil
conscience
.




1Jn
3
:18 
My
little
children
,
let
us
not
love
in
word
,
neither
in
---------------

assure
our
hearts
before
him
.



There
in
the
above
scripture
lies
a
conscience
that
is
a
foundation
to
rightly
discern
the
truth
,
and
in
the
below
scripture
,
the
bisection
of
choosing
by
His
will
a
good
or
evil
conscience
.




1Jn
3
:20 
For
if
our
heart
condemn
us
,
God
is
greater
than
our
heart
,
---------------

If
we
are
an
Elect
of
God
,
He
assures
us
that
our
heart
,
that
is
,
our
mind
,
will
know
the
difference
between
a
good
and
evil
conscience
,
and
our
Lord
will
provide
the
power
for
us
to
ultimately
learn
to
choose
righteously
.


---------------

his
commandments
,
and
do
those
things
that
are
pleasing
in
his
sight
.



How
easy
is
it
to
simply
ask
our
Lord
to
give
us
a
pure
conscience
in
all
that
we
think
.


If
we
thus
have
that
pure
conscience
,
we
are
keeping
all
the
commandments
of
Christ
,
and
our
hope
in
the
First
Resurrection
,
Lord
willing
,
will
be
assured
.


---------------

1Jn
3
:24 
And
he
that
keepeth
his
commandments
dwelleth
in
him
,
and
he

in
him
.


And
hereby
we
know
that
he
abideth
in
us
,
by
the
spirit
which

he
hath
given
us
[in
practising
a
good
conscience
]
.



We
have
seen
that
we
can’t
have
light
without
knowing
darkness
,
and
comparably
,
a
good
conscience
without
knowing
an
evil
conscience
.


Let’s
review
some
everyday
examples
of
us
being
assailed
by
an
evil
conscience
,
namely
the
seemingly
imperishable
lust
of
the
eyes
,
the
lust
of
the
flesh
and
the
pride
of
life
.



In
the
Old
Covenant
,
an
evil
conscience
was
somewhat
foreign
to
lust
yet
still
pricked
their
consciences
.




Mat
19
:8 
He
[Christ
]
saith
unto
them
[the
Apostles
]
,
Moses
because
of
---------------

adultery
.

 

Wow
!


What
an
indictment
of
a
good
conscience
that
mankind
,
subliminally
from
the
beginning
,
as
did
Adam
,
Eve
and
Cain
at
heart
,
knew
by
their
subsequent
actions
of
hiding
,
revealed
an
evil
heart
against
what
constituted
a
good
conscience
.




Mat
5
:27 
Ye
have
heard
that
it
was
said
by
them
of
old
time
,
Thou
---------------

In
Matthew
5
,
Christ
is
instituting
the
spirit
of
keeping
all
His
commandments
,
resulting
in
growing
a
perfect
conscience
as
He
and
the
Father
perpetually
exist
without
contrast
.



Yet
,
like
Cain
and
Paul
,
their
consciences
beheld
a
shadowy
dichotomy
of
a
pricked
conscience
suggesting
something
(spiritually
)
awry
.


With
that
same
conscience
,
Solomon
,
who
is
who
we
are
before
knowing
Christ
,
withheld
from
himself
no
lust
,
as
seen
in
Ecclesiastes
2
:10
.


Solomon
and
everyone
under
the
Old
Covenant
were
blessed
materially
for
their
lawful
dedication
to
loving
God
.


Their
physical
wealth
denoted
their
love
for
God
in
a
shadowy
good
conscience
and
was
evidence
of
their
righteous
living
.



---------------

a
blessing
and
a
curse
;

Deu
11
:27 
A
blessing
,
if
ye
obey
the
commandments
of
the
LORD
your

God
,
which
I
command
you
this
day
[and
resulting
good
conscience
]
:

Deu
11
:28 
And
a
curse
,
if
ye
will
not
obey
the
commandments
of
the

LORD
your
God
[and
resulting
evil
conscience
]
,
but
turn
aside
out
of

the
way
which
I
command
you
this
day
,
to
go
after
other
gods
,
which
ye

have
not
known
[and
assuredly
a
resulting
evil
conscience
]
.



As
earlier
expressed
,
much
later
Achan
,
under
those
commandments
,
 knew
by
his
evil
conscience
that
he
had
done
wrong
since
he
hid
his
treasure
in
the
ground
beneath
his
tent
.


The
spirit
of
keeping
the
Lord’s
commands
was
already
evident
by
the
conviction
of
their
Old
Covenant
hearts
.



Jesus
,
being
flesh
,
lived
in
perfectly
good
conscience
,
yet
He
knew
that
He
was
subject
to
an
evil
conscience
by
virtue
of
being
tempted
to
acquiesce
with
an
evil
conscience
in
submitting
to
the
Devil’s
wiles
~
evil
was
present
within
His
flesh
as
it
is
in
us
,
yet
he
didn’t
sin
,
but
we
do
.


---------------

none
good
but
one
,
that
is
,
God
.



We
all
,
as
Solomon
,
if
given
to
honestly
study
our
consciences
,
would
conclude
that
our
lusts
are
vanity
,
a
vapour
of
joy
unable
to
be
retained
.


Solomon
came
close
to
understanding
the
misty
conclusion
of
his
polarised
conscience
,
confusing
him
while
he
did
his
best
to
live
by
the
Laws
of
Moses
,
and
yet
knew
some
unidentifiable
spirit
couldn’t
be
grasped
.


That
missing
something
was
the
unheard-of
holy
spirit
that
urges
a
pure
conscience
that
later
,
in
his
experiences
with
the
Shulamite
he
frustratingly
continued
to
see
blackness
.


Christ’s
love
isn’t
awakened
in
Solomon
and
the
world
until
He
pleases
in
the
---------------
Life’s
experiences
only
produced
struggles
against
sin
to
be
always
faced
with
the
junction
of
choosing
,
by
our
Lord’s
hand
,
a
pathway
of
either
a
good
or
evil
conscience
.




Ecc
1
:14 
I
have
seen
all
the
works
that
are
done
under
the
sun
;
and
,
---------------

Our
works
always
cause
us
to
constantly
be
vexed
by
having
to
choose
the
route
of
a
good
or
evil
conscience
.

 


Ecc
1
:15 
That
which
is
crooked
cannot
be
made
straight
:
and
that
---------------

We
are
constantly
besieged
by
the
choice
of
a
good
or
evil
pathway
of
conscience
.

 


Pro
21
:8 
The
way
of
him
that
is
laden
with
guilt
is
exceeding

crooked
;
But
as
for
the
pure
[conscience
]
,
his
work
is
right
.




Ecc
1
:16 
I
communed
with
mine
own
heart
[my
conscience
!


]
,
saying
,
Lo
,

I
am
come
to
great
estate
,
and
have
gotten
more
wisdom
than
all
they

that
have
been
before
me
in
Jerusalem
:
yea
,
my
heart
had
great
---------------

knowledge
increaseth
sorrow
.

 

Without
the
holy
spirit
to
prick
our
consciences
,
when
in
Babylon
,
we
as
did
Solomon
,
experienced
an
indefinable
sorrow
where
immense
physical
prosperity
and
wives
(churches
)
eluded
our
quest
for
peace
and
perfect
joy
,
always
searching
but
never
coming
to
the
truth
.


Our
dichotic
consciences
increased
sorrow
.




Ecc
2
:9 
So
I
was
great
,
and
increased
more
than
all
that
were
before
---------------

labour
:
and
this
was
my
portion
of
all
my
labour
.



There
is
some
truth
that
,
in
good
conscience
,
particularly
Solomon
in
his
time
,
and
remnants
of
us
in
Babylon
believe
that
it
is
our
right
to
pursue
any
joy
of
the
flesh
as
long
as
we
use
our
“wisdom”
to
not
---------------

With
an
elusive
Shulamite-like
epiphany
,
Solomon
was
further
vexed
by
his
conscience
.


With
classic
introspection
,
he
says
, 


Ecc
2
:11 
Then
I
looked
on
all
the
works
that
my
hands
had
wrought
,
---------------

How
utterly
frustrating
it
is
in
Babylon
when
a
mist
of
Christ’s
spirit
,
for
the
most
part
,
veils
our
conscience
.


When
given
a
Stephen-like
revelation
upon
keeping
all
the
commandments
of
God
,
a
good
conscience
hailstones
our
understanding
,
washing
away
the
multitude
of
lies
and
outshining
all
vexations
of
darkness
.


---------------
~
and
us
~
with
captivating
doctrines
)
while
not
understanding
that
they
all
represent
the
same
ruling
deception
.


A
man’s
wife
mirrors
himself
as
having
a
heart
that
ensnares
his
conscience
with
evil
and
fetters
his
hands
to
‘excuse’
himself
and
hide
from
sin
(Ecc
7
:25-29
)
.


She
is
the
reflection
of
his
narcissism
,
and
he
is
unwittingly
taken
by
his
own
beauty
,
having
ascended
to
heaven
unconsciously
to
presume
a
dethroning
of
God
.


While
pricked
by
a
good
conscience
,
he
is
so
easily
led
away
by
his
lust
and
conceit
to
be
god
;
flattering
himself
seems
the
more
,
at
least
,
temporal
joy
.


Like
Esau’s
fleeting
passion
to
satiate
his
famished
state
,
we
always
have
time
to
reflect
upon
our
choice
of
conscience
.


If
a
semblance
of
righteousness
resides
,
we
should
be
stabbed
through
our
liver
with
an
evil
conscience
for
not
fully
considering
the
Lord’s
commandments
.




Pro
6
:23 
For
the
commandment
is
a
lamp
;
and
the
law
is
light
;
and

reproofs
of
instruction
are
the
way
of
life
: 
[and
peace
through
a
good

conscience
]

Pro
6
:24 
To
keep
thee
from
the
evil
woman
,
from
the
flattery
of
the

tongue
of
a
strange
woman 
[the
strange
woman
within
ruling
our

conscience
]
.



Pro
6
:25 
Lust
not
after
her
beauty
in
thine
heart
;
neither
let
her

take
thee
with
her
eyelids
.

Jas
1
:12 
Blessed
is
the
man
that
endureth
temptation
[In
this
case

choosing
a
good
or
evil
conscience
]
:
for
when
he
is
tried
,
he
shall

receive
the
crown
of
life
,
which
the
Lord
hath
promised
to
them
that

love
him
.

 

Jas
1
:13 
Let
no
man
say
when
he
is
tempted
,
I
am
tempted
of
God
:
for

God
cannot
be
tempted
with
evil
,
neither
tempteth
he
any
man
:
[God

doesn’t
have
an
evil
conscience
to
tempt
anybody
] 

Jas
1
:14 
But
every
man
is
tempted
,
when
he
is
drawn
away
of
his
own

lust
,
and
enticed
.

 
[…
with
his
bias
towards
an
evil
conscience
]

Jas
1
:15 
Then
when
lust
hath
conceived
,
it
bringeth
forth
sin
[and

the
knowledge
of
an
evil
conscience
that
is
amplified
to
hide
the

sin
]
:
and
sin
,
when
it
is
finished
,
bringeth
forth
death
.



The
famous
German
philosopher
Friedrich
Nietzsche
said
,
“A
bad
conscience
is
easier
to
cope
with
than
a
bad
reputation
.

” Why
?


Because
a
bad
conscience
is
mostly
contrived
in
secret
,
whereas
a
bad
reputation
is
humiliating
and
mostly
for
everyone
to
see
.


We
are
more
likely
to
fear
another’s
condemnation
rather
than
God’s
since
God
seems
far
off
and
not
in
our
faces
.


It
is
easier
in
the
short
term
to
hide
a
bad
reputation
,
even
with
having
to
live
with
the
amplification
of
an
evil
conscience
forever
.




Pro
9
:10 
The
fear
of
the
LORD
is
the
beginning
of
wisdom
:
and
the
---------------

We
can
accuse
,
excuse
and
run
and
hide
all
we
like
from
an
evil
conscience
but
are
guaranteed
to
face
the
music
of
the
last
Trump
heralding
our
judgment
,
either
in
this
age
or
the
next
.



As
stated
in
the
previous
studies
in
this
series
,
by
being
made
from
the
outset
in
Adam
having
a
trace
of
our
Lord’s
spirit
,
we
know
,
as
Adam
proved
,
a
conscience
when
we
are
disobedient
to
God’s
laws
.


If
we
weren’t
by
default
disobedient
,
we
wouldn’t
have
known
a
good
conscience
.




Gen
3
:4 
And
the
serpent
said
unto
the
woman
,
Ye
shall

---------------
physical
power
and
later
his
power
,
his
spirit
,
prior
to
being
faced
with
a
fork
in
the
road
of
knowledge
and
thoughts
to
choose
good
or
evil
and
a
resulting
conscience
.



Conclusion

It
is
impossible
to
escape
the
God-given
choice
of
good
and
evil
and
the
corresponding
consciences
.



The
Bride
of
Christ
is
most
grateful
for
her
Lord
making
“all
things”
hers
to
experience
(1Co
3
:22
)
,
the
good
equally
with
the
day
of
evil
,
to
cause
both
a
good
and
evil
conscience
to
be
astronomically
impactful
.


There
is
no
escaping
hiding
among
the
trees
and
passing
the
buck
when
discovered
,
only
to
vainly
excuse
ourselves
from
the
evil
that
we
are
---------------
Such
a
person
rightly
divides
the
truth
from
error
.


His
foundation
of
judgment
is
guided
by
the
holy
spirit
of
truth
and
,
with
a
good
conscience
,
condemns
his
warring
evil
conscience
.

l

If
we
love
lying
,
we
love
our
bias
for
an
evil
conscience
,
one
that
,
in
a
soon-coming
study
,
runs
the
grave
risk
of
a
“seared
conscience”
that
is
impervious
to
a
good
conscience
.

 Moral
conscience is
a
part
of
the
cognitive
process
in
mind
that
tells
whether
an
act
is
morally
right
or
wrong
.


In
other
words
,
it
is
awareness
of
moral
principles
and
whether
act
done
is
in
accordance
with
these
principles
or
not
.


It
is
an
instrument
for
self-control
,
correction
and
regulation
.


The
proper
understanding
of
the
moral
conscience
is
basic
to
our
understanding
of
morality
and
to
an
ethical
conduct
.



Role
of
moral
conscience
in
ethical
behaviour
:

1
.


Right
choices
:
Human
actions
entail
free
decisions
concerning
ends
---------------

concern
making
right
choices
based
on
the
analysis
of
the
nature
of

acts
and
the
intentions
and
circumstances
that
are
involved
.


Moral

conscience
help
guide
people
to
follow
the
right
means
to
a
right

end
.


2
.


Inner
guide
:
Moral
conscience
is
our
inner
guide
and
it
helps
you

figure
out
how
to
make
good
choices
.


As
we
grow
up
,
we
learn
right

from
wrong
.


Our
moral
conscience
is
the
thought
and
feeling
we
have

that
tells
us
whether
something
is
a
right
or
wrong
thing
to
do
or

say
.


Thus
it
is
a
consistent
guide
to
ethical
decision
making
.


3
.


Source
of
information
:
The
moral
conscience
is
considered
the

proximate
norm
of
conduct
because
it
is
the
immediate
source
of

information
guiding
human
actions
.


It
directs
human
actions
so
that

a
person
can
transcend
his
animal
instincts
and
human
inclinations
.



Moral
conscience
allows
man
to
exercise
reason
and
thus
allow
an

objective
decision
and
act
based
on
right
values
.


4
.


Decision
making
:
Without
moral
conscience
a
person
would
doubt
even

the
smallest
decisions
.

Since
the
judgment
of
moral
conscience
is
a

judgment
about
how
an
action
conforms
or
does
not
conform
to
natural

law
,
then
,
it
is
obligatory
to
act
according
to
one’s
conscience
.



Although
there
are
persons
who
have
a
doubtful
conscience
which

renders
them
unable
to
decide
upon
actions
easily
.


A
well-formed

moral
conscience
is
effective
because
it
makes
practical
judgments

with
relative
ease
or
after
seeking
necessary
advice
.


5
.


Resolving
ethical
dilemmas
:
A
human
being
always
comes
across

ethical
dilemmas
in
the
decision
making
process
.


Moral
Conscience

acts
as
the
guide
for
taking
correct
decisions
when
we
have
to

choose
between
competing
sets
of
principles
in
a
given
,
usually

undesirable
or
perplexing
,
situation
.


Example
: 
Helping
accident

victims
on
your
way
to
an
interview
.


6
.


Rational
decision
:
Through
our
individual
moral
conscience
,
one

becomes
aware
of
his
deeply
held
moral
principles
,
and
motivates

accordingly
to
act
upon
those
principles
removing
conflicts
.


As
we

assess
our
character
,
our
behaviour
and
ultimately
our
self
against

those
principles
,
conscience
leads
to
proper
analysis
of
good
and

bad
of
the
situation
and
proper
evaluation
of
various
options
.


7
.


Ethical
Awareness
:
This
is
our
ability
to
recognise
ethical
values

and
principles
.


The
moral
conscience
enables
the
human
mind
to

understand
the
world
in
moral
terms
.


This
enhances
our
ability
to

make
practical
decisions
in
light
of
ethical
values
and
principles
.


---------------

important
in
public
services
.


Tostay
impartial
,
it
is
important
that

public
servants
must
object
to
any
favours
and
corrupt
activities
.



Moral
conscience
helps
in
conscientious
objection
by
making
an

individual
aware
of
the
impact
of
his
decisions
on
larger
public
.



Limitation
of
moral
conscience
in
ethical
behaviour
:

1
.


Individuality
:
Moral
conscience
is
highly
personal
and
varies
with

individuals
.


For
example
,
a
person
might
think
killing
muslim
as

moral
in
order
to
take
revenge
.


In
his
conscience
it
is
moral
to

kill
muslim
and
help
Hindu
cause
.


2
.


Social
norms
:
Moral
conscience
is
guided
by
the
social
norms
in

general
.


It
can
impact
the
ethical
thinking
of
an
individual
leading

to
unethical
behaviour
.


For
example
,
in
Islamic
countries
many
are

misguided
in
name
of
jihad
and
act
of
terrorism
is
held
moral
and
as

an
act
of
sacrifice
for
the
cause
of
religion
.


3
.


Courage
:
Despite
being
morally
conscience
about
what
is
right
,
an

individual
might
lack
courage
to
act
ethically
.


For
example
,
a
civil

servant
might
know
that
his
colleague
is
taking
bribes
,
he
may
not
---------------

etc
.


define
an
individual’s
morals
.


Thus
,
one
might
not
know
what
he

is
doing
is
immoral
.


For
example
,
a
person
might
beat
his
wife
as
in

his
conscience
mind
it
is
not
immoral
,
due
to
patriarchal
mindset
.



Thus
the
moral
conscience
plays
an
important
role
in
making
moral
decisions
and
actions
.


The
reason
behind
conscience
as
the
ultimate
,
highest
determiner
of
moral
action
and
its
authority
is
the
idea
that
when
conscience
and
all
other
principles
are
properly
understood
,
they
promote
and
motivate
us
to
act
that
are
in
accordance
with
our
nature
.

Few
novelists
have
captured
the
ultimate
ambiguity
of
conscience
better
than
Mark
Twain
did
in
Huckleberry
Finn
.


Jim
,
the
escaped
slave
who
accompanies
Huck
down
the
river
on
a
raft
,
is
on
a
journey
to
reunite
with
his
beloved
family
(whom
white
people
have
separated
from
him
)
.


In
several
scenes
,
Huck
,
beset
with
guilt
for
not
handing
Jim
over
to
the
authorities
as
his
conscience
naggingly
instructs
him
to
,
anguishes
over
his
default
role
as
an
escapee
'
s
accomplice
.



---------------
concerned
father
figure
he
never
had
but
in
many
ways
as
a
paragon
of
virtue
,
despite
the
color
of
his
skin
,
Huck
decides
to
disobey
his
conscience
.


In
doing
so
,
he
demonstrates
the
courage
many
literary
critics
have
cited
as
constituting
the
novel
'
s
moral
climax
:

---------------


It
don
'
t
make
no
difference
whether
you
do
right
or
wrong
,
a
person
'
s

conscience
ain
'
t
got
no
sense
,
and
just
goes
for
him
anyway
.



But
because
Huck
isn
'
t
yet
mature
or
free-thinking
enough
to
triumph
---------------
freedom—which
,
despite
tremendous
personal
risks
,
Jim
so
desperately
seeks
because
of
his
dedication
to
his
wife
and
children—would
be
to
mirror
his
society
'
s
corrupted
conscience
.


Huck
'
s
safeguarding
of
Jim
from
all
the
people
who
'
d
prefer
(primarily
for
ignoble
reasons
)
to
return
him
to
slavery
can
be
comprehended
as
depicting
a
true
versus
an
artificial
,
culturally-derived
conscience
.



Ernest
Hemingway
,
deeply
influenced
by
Twain
'
s
plain-spoken
style
and
---------------
definitions
of
morality
as
simplistic—and
frequently
false
.



Defining
conscience
from
a
religious
perspective

Let
'
s
now
look
at
customary
definitions
of
conscience
to
illustrate
how
they
stop
short
of
accounting
for
the
many
ambiguities
so
often
found
in
reality
,
for
what
'
s
ideal
and
what
'
s
practically
possible
can
at
times
---------------

The
literature
online
relating
particularly
to
the
oxymoronic
concept
of
an
evil
conscience
emanates
mostly
from
theology—and
we
'
ll
deal
with
this
orientation
first
.


The
approach
that
fundamentalist
religion
takes
toward
ethics
is
absolutist
,
placing
a
person
'
s
behavior
into
neat
,
---------------
all
of
its
supporting
evidence
from
Scriptures
,
Greg
Stuckey
defines
any
human
wrongdoing
as—purely
and
simply—evil
.


So
anyone
afflicted
with
such
a
presumed
immoral
conscience
will
experience
as
good
what
the
Bible
delineates
as
evil
,
and
vice
versa
.



---------------
precisely
what
they
should
be
ashamed
of
.


Rather
than
feeling
troubled
by
hurting
others
,
they
perversely
take
joy
in
it
.


Looked
at
from
this
dogmatic
ecclesiastical
stance
,
an
evil
conscience
is
synonymous
with
sinning
against
God—and
it
requires
paying
penance
to
God
if
one
is
to
be
forgiven
.

The
Evil
Conscience


“Let
us
draw
near
with
a
sincere
heart
in
full
assurance
of
faith
,

having
our
hearts
sprinkled
clean
from
an
evil
conscience
and
our

bodies
washed
with
pure
water
.

”


Hebrews
10
:22

How
could
this
be
?


A
conscience
that
is
evil
?


The
traditionalists
are
going
to
faint
when
they
hear
about
this
!


Could
it
be
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
conscience
that
directs
man
to
do
what
is
evil
instead
of
what
is
good
?


Absolutely
.


Just
as
it
is
possible
to
have
a
broken
compass
that
points
east
instead
of
north
.


---------------
continually
(Genesis
6
:5
)
.


These
men
were
later
annihilated
by
the
flood
.


Think
about
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
:
do
you
think
those
guys
were
interested
in
doing
what
was
right
based
on
their
conscience
?


They
were
only
interested
in
sex
with
any
man
or
woman
they
could
find
.


Don’t
be
surprised
,
this
is
what
the
heart
,
mind
and
conscience
of
man
can
degenerate
into
.

 

The
conscience
of
man
can
be
such
that
instead
of
leading
you
to
do
what
is
right
,
it
leads
you
to
do
what
is
evil
.


Again
,
like
the
Seared
Conscience
,
you
can
either
develop
an
evil
conscience
or
be
born
with
it
.


The
difference
between
the
seared
and
evil
conscience
is
that
a
seared
conscience
is
devoid
of
guilt
or
without
regret
from
doing
what
is
wrong
,
or
the
conscience
itself
is
silent
;
an
evil
conscience
,
however
,
directs
the
heart
of
man
towards
evil
instead
of
good
,
doing
the
opposite
of
what
a
normal
,
functioning
conscience
would
do
.

 

In
theory
:
A
good
conscience
keeps
us
from
doing
wrong
because
it
is
a
voice
within
that
directs
us
towards
the
right
action
.



An
evil
conscience
desires
for
us
to
do
what
is
wrong
constantly
,
and
because
of
this
desire
,
there
is
no
guilt
associated
with
committing
whatever
evil
deed
your
heart
desires
.

 

You
would
be
surprised
to
hear
that
such
a
conscience
is
actually
quite
prevalent
in
the
Church
.


Because
it
is
easy
to
do
evil
and
still
walk
into
the
assembly
like
there
is
nothing
wrong
.


This
is
popular
at
highly
---------------
assembly
.

 

An
evil
conscience
will
keep
you
sinning
and
give
you
no
reason
to
change
.


All
the
popular 
tools
of
change
endorsed
by
the
Church

(Guilt/Shame/Conscience/Fear
)
have
been
taken
out
of
your
toolbelt
.


According
to
them
,
you
will
not
be
able
to
progress
.


Without
an
overwhelming
sense
of
guilt
,
how
will
you
change
?

 
---------------
all
emotion
,
men
must
press
on
and
do
what
is
right
.


They
must
work
,
improve
,
train
and
move
towards
being
the
fully
formed
and
functional
men
they
need
to
be
.


Reject
the
weak
man’s
idea
of
conscience
,
embrace
the
rigid
strength
of
discipline
unaltered
by
feeling
.



Mantra

Reject
conscience
,
embrace
action
.

 


[evil
conscience
]

Application

If
you
have
an
evil
conscience
,
you
must
do
the
opposite
of
what
your
conscience
tells
you
to
do
.


It
is
as
simple
as
that
.


If
your
conscience
is
evil
,
it
is
pulling
you
towards
evil
action
,
so
you
must
resist
your
conscience
and
oppose
it
in
order
to
do
what
is
right
.


Again
,
it
does
not
matter
if
you
feel
like
doing
what
is
right
,
or
if
you
want
to
,
or
what
your
motivation
is
,
it
only
matters
if
you
do
what
is
right
or
not
.


What
are
your
actions
?


They
can
be
good
or
evil
regardless
of
what
kind
of
conscience
you
have
.

 

Again
,
and
at
risk
of
being
overly
redundant
,
reject
the
idea
of
the
necessity
of
conscience
.

 

Conscience
is
a
tool
to
be
used
for
change
,
but
change
is
possible
without
this
tool
.


This
is
a
principle
fact
of
life
.


You
must
do
what
is
right
regardless
of
emotional
states
,
including
the
emotional
state
of
a
conscience
.


You
must
focus
and
take
action
.


Do
what
is
right
.


Be
a
Man
.



Conduct
Yourselves
Like
Men
.

Conscience
describes
two
things
–
what
a
person
believes
is
right
and
how
a
person
decides
what
is
right
.


More
than
just
‘gut
instinct’
,
our
conscience
is
a
‘moral
muscle’
.



By
informing
us
of
our values
and
principles
,
it
becomes
the
standard
we
---------------
This
is
our
ability
to
recognise
ethical
values
and
principles
.



The
medieval
philosopher Thomas
Aquinas believed
our
conscience
emerged
from synderesis
:
the
‘spark
of
conscience’
.


He
literally
meant
the
human
mind’s
ability
to
understand
the
world
in
moral
terms
.


Conscience
was
the
process
by
which
a
person
brought
the
principles
of synderesis into
a
practical
situation
through
our
decisions
.


---------------
so
we
would
know
how
to
act
virtuously
under
the
circumstances
.



A
conscience
which
is
both
well
formed
(shaped
by
education
and
experience
)
and
well
informed
(aware
of
facts
,
evidence
and
so
on
)
enables
us
to
know
ourselves
and
our
world
and
act
accordingly
.



Seeing
conscience
in
this
way
is
important
because
it
teaches
us
ethics
is
not
innate
.


By
continuously
working
to
understand
our
surroundings
,
we
strengthen
our
moral
muscle
.


---------------
Conscientious
Objection

In
politics
,
much
of
the
debate
around
conscience
concerns
the “right
to conscientious
objection”
.



---------------

For
a
long
time
,
Western
nations
,
informed
by
the
Catholic
intellectual
tradition
,
believed
in
the
“primacy
of
conscience”
–
the
idea
that
a
person
should
never
be
forced
to
do
something
they
believe
is
against
their
most
deeply
held
values
and
principles

Aquinas’

of
the

Natural

Aquinas’
theory
on
how
God
is
the
grounding
and
source
of
morality

Conscience
is
about
the
human

Conscience
is

Accuse

–
“by

or

This
is
how
the
conscience
causes
guilt
.


Conscience
is
our
ability
to
know
whether
we
have
done
something
,
whether
we
should
have
done
it
,
and
whether
it
was
done
well
.


If
we
have
done
something
wrong
,
our
conscience
will
accuse
,
torment
and
rebuke
us
–
causing
feelings
of
guilt
.



Because
human
reason
is
fallible
,
the
conscience
thereby
becomes
fallible
.


We
could
be
mistaken
for
example
when
we
don’t know
how
a
general
rule
applies
to
a
certain
situation
(mistake
in
conscientia
)
.


---------------
called
apparent
goods
because
they
only
appear
good
to
someone
engaged

reasoning
.


They
are
not
real
goods
.


Despite
this
potential
for
our
conscience
judging
something
bad
to
be
good
,
Aquinas
still
insists
we
must
follow
it
:

“Every
judgment
of
conscience
,
be
it
right
or
wrong
…
is
obligatory
…
he
who
acts
against
his
conscience
always
sins”

This
is
because
if
you
choose
to
act
against
your
conscience
,
then
you
are
choosing
to
do
something
you
believe
to
be
evil
.


Conscience
is
thus
always
‘binding’
.



Vincible
vs
invincible
ignorance

Whether
errors
in
conscience
that
lead
to
sinful
acts
will
be
forgiven
or
pardoned
depends
on
the
type
of
ignorance
that
caused
the
error
.



---------------
very
statement
that
man
is
estranged
from
his
created
nature
presupposes
an
experience
of
the
abyss
between
what
he
essentially
is
and
what
is
existentially
is
.


Even
a
weak
or
misled
conscience
is
still
a
conscience
,
namely
,
the
silent
voice
of
man’s
own
essential
nature
,
judging
his
actual
being”
–
Tillich
.



To
deny
that
our
conscience
can
discover
the
natural
law
is
to
claim
that
there
is
a
gap
between
what
we
currently
are
and
what
we
could
be
.


Yet
,
to
have
an
awareness
of
that
gap
is
to
have
a
conscience
that
is
aware
of
its
fallen
state
.


So
it
is
contradictory
to
deny
the
natural
law
.


Even
it
now
involves
a
weakened
conscience
,
that
still
tells
us
at
least
something
of
the
direction
we
have
fallen
in
and
the
direction
back
towards
righteousness
.



However
,
whatever
a
weak
and
misled
conscience
discovers
is
surely
not
God’s
morality
.


Humanity
believing
it
has
the
ability
to
know
anything
of
God
is
the
same
arrogance
that
caused
Adam
and
Eve
to
disobey
God
.


---------------
inability
to
be
humble
enough
to
simply
have
faith

Psychological
views
on
the
conscience

Sigmund
Freud

Freud
thought
the
conscience
was
just
the
result
of
psychological
forces
that
science
could
understand
.

the
mind
was
divided
into
the
Id
(our
unconscious
animalistic
desires
)
,
Ego

conscious
---------------
thought
responsible
for
many
mental
problems
.



The
ethical
implications
is
that
conscience
is
not
the
voice
of
God
in
us
,
it
is
just
what
our
society
wants
from
us
.


Our
society
might
be
good
or
bad
,
therefore
our
conscience
is
not
the
best
guide
if
Freud
is
right
.


Furthermore
there
might
not
even
be
a
‘good
or
bad’
,
if
morality
is
merely
the
conditioning
of
societies
on
its
members

to

argued

nature

abstract
cognitive
moral
beliefs
about
how

ought

Definition

Conscience
is
a
faculty
of
the
mind
that
motivates
us
to
act
morally—or
at
least
according
to
our
most
deeply
held
values
.

 
Most
say
it
is
a
form
of
intuition
and
uses
emotion
,
although
others
have
argued
that
it
should
be
shaped
by
reason
.

 
It
is
a
private
experience
,
and
a
form
of
self-knowledge
;
from
one’s
conscience
one
can
learn
one’s
own
values
and
morals
.

 
This
is
the
root
of
the
word
,
from
the
latin
con-scientia
,
perhaps
translatable
as
“together-with-knowing”
–
to
be
together
with
one’s
knowledge
(of
morality
)
.



Yet
,
conscience
has
been
thought
by
many
to
be
informed
by
an
objective
morality
,
with
divine
,
transcendental
,
or
natural
sources
.

 
Even
in
our
society
,
where
we
ostensibly
recognize
the
cultural
and
personal
relativity
of
morality
,
conscience
is
granted
a
special
status
,
with
laws
protecting
the
rights
of
doctors
and
others
not
to
violate
their
consciences
.

 
So
,
conscience
is
private
,
subjective
,
and
culturally
relative
,
but
carries
legal
and
political
weight
.



There
are
many
different
ideas
about
conscience—religious
,
philosophical
,
scientific
,
legal
,
and
popular
:

-
Religious
:
in
most
religions
,
the
morality
that
informs
conscience

does
or
should
come
from
either
God
,
or
an
enlightened
mind
.



Religions
differ
as
to
whether
conscience
is
thought
of
mainly
as
a

punisher
(e
.

g
.


Catholic
)
or
as
a
virtue
to
be
cultivated
(e
.

g
.



Protestant
,
Buddhist
)
.


-
Philosophical
:
many
philosophers
have
written
that
a
truly
moral

conscience
requires
the
exercise
of
reason
;
others
have
claimed
that

it
is
an
intuition
of
objective
moral
truth
.


Pre-modern
philosophers

tended
to
believe
in
a
natural
and
objective
morality
informing

conscience—something
like
a
truly
moral
instinct
.

 
Modern

philosophers
tend
to
recognize
the
cultural
and
individual

relativity
of
morality
,
and
many
present
arguments
based
on
---------------
-
Scientific
:
such
as
theories
in
evolutionary
psychology
,
cognitive

science
,
and
sociology
.


-
Legal
:
Our
society
seems
to
recognize
“freedom
of
conscience”
–
that

we
should
be
free
to
obey
our
consciences
–
within
limits
.



Considering
that
we
don’t
have
a
clear
or
unified
philosophy
of

conscience
,
this
raises
legal
,
political
,
and
social
issues
.


-
Popular
:
Our
everyday
notions
of
conscience
are
philosophically

interesting
.


Consider
that
conscience
is
a
part
of
us
opposing

actions
that
we
ourselves
apparently
already
consider
immoral
,
but

are
in
danger
of
doing
anyway
.

 
It
seems
a
little
paradoxical
.

 
Why

do
we
need
a
conscience
?


Evolutionary
theory
most
likely
has
the

answer
(see
“History”
section
)

Thought
about
conscience
is
so
diverse
and
complex
that
a
comprehensive
treatment
is
not
possible
.


This
seems
another
paradox
about
conscience
;
we
know
it
most
intimately
in
ourselves
,
but
there
is
no
consensus
about
where
it
comes
from
,
or
how
much
it
should
be
respected
.

Controversies
about
Conscience

Freedom
of
conscience
is
part
of
the
United
Nations’
Declaration
of
Human
Rights
,
and
the
laws
of
many
nations
.

 
Yet
we
have
reason
to
question
the
idea
.

 
Former
Nazi
generals
have
told
interviewers
that
they
acted
with
a
clear
conscience
,
because
their
actions
were
sanctioned
by
their
leadership
and
society
.

 
This
would
be
consistent
with
ideas
about
conscience
as
a
social
instinct
,
but
not
necessarily
an
altruistic
one
as
Darwin
thought—perhaps
conscience
merely
urges
us
to
conform
with
the
mores
of
our
society
or
belief-systems
.



Freedom
of
conscience
is
problematic
because
it’s
perfectly
possible
for
people’s
consciences
to
insist
on
actions
that
most
of
consider
harmful
to
other
human
beings—such
as
refusing
to
vaccinate
their
children
.



There
are
several
traditional
arguments
in
favor
of
freedom
of
conscience
:

-
The
argument
from
hypocrisy
or
ineffectiveness
:
Most
people
agree

that
it
is
impossible
to
change
a
person’s
conscience
from
the

outside
;
therefore
,
not
granting
freedom
of
conscience
means

requiring
people
to
act
contrary
to
their
beliefs
,
which
seems

wrong
.


This
was
a
reason
to
consider
persecuting
heretics
---------------

However
,
the
argument
from
hypocrisy
can
be
turned
around
;
if
you
can’t
change
a
person’s
conscience
,
then
they
still
have
freedom
of
conscience
,
even
if
you
force
them
to
behave
in
a
certain
way
.



-
The
argument
from
ignorance
:
This
is
based
on
the
recognition
of

relativism
and
subjectivism
.


If
our
consciences
don’t
give
us

objective
moral
guidance
,
then
you
can’t
assume
that
yours
is
right

and
another’s
wrong
,
therefore
you
don’t
have
a
right
to
deny
them

freedom
of
conscience
.


-
The
argument
from
legitimization
:
John
Stuart
Mill
argued
that
it
is

best
for
society
if
all
people
express
their
convictions
freely
,
for
---------------

However
,
none
of
these
arguments
completely
addresses
the
conflicts
between
freedom
of
conscience
and
public
well-being
.

 
Some
might
say
that
a
doctor
who
refuses
to
perform
a
life-saving
operation
out
of
conscience
should
be
charged
with
negligence
or
even
manslaughter
.

 
While
others
might
feel
that
performing
the
operation
is
murder
.


The
precise
limits
of
freedom
of
conscience
are
still
an
open
debate
with
profound
consequences
.

History
of
Conscience

Before
cultural
relativity
and
subjectivism
came
into
vogue
during
the
20
^
(th
)
century
,
conscience
was
considered
a
source
of
objective
moral
knowledge
by
almost
everyone
,
however
in
different
senses
in
different
cultures
.

 
In
ancient
Hinduism
,
Buddhism
,
and
Taoism
,
knowledge
of
good
---------------
more
likely
a
source
of
sin
than
morality
.

 
Instead
,
obedience
to
God’s
law
is
thought
the
only
true
morality
.

 
This
would
mean
that
true
conscience
is
knowledge
of
God’s
law
,
whether
that
comes
directly
from
God
,
or
through
obedience
to
scripture
or
clergy
;
all
these
possibilities—direct
revelation
,
scripture
,
and
obedience
to
authorities–have
been
claimed
as
the
source
of
moral
knowledge
in
these
religions
.

 
However
,
in
practice
,
these
religions
also
teach
purification
of
the
mind
to
attain
true
conscience
;
where
Eastern
religions
teach
that
a
pure
mind
allows
the
truth
to
emerge
from
within
one’s
own
consciousness

versions
of
the
Abrahamic
religions
see
a
---------------

Despite
the
emphasis
on
blind
obedience
in
Christianity
,
medieval
Christian
philosophers
developed
a
theory
of
conscience
with
a
strong
role
for
both
intuition
and
reasoning
.

 
St
.


Bonaventure
and
St
.


Aquinas
wrote
of
synderesis
–
a
divine
spark
of
moral
knowledge
–
which
could
---------------
perspective
of
eternity
,
with
a
peaceful
mind
,
you
will
perceive
moral
truth
.

  
Kant
also
regarded
critical
reasoning
as
an
important
element
of
conscience
,
believing
that
moral
truth
could
be
evaluated
objectively
in
light
of
his
‘categorical
imperative
.

’ 
Other
18
^
(th
)
century
philosophers
believed
that
conscience
was
purely
intuitive
,
excluding
reason
,
but
like
Kant
,
many
of
them
also
believed
in
the
objectivity
of
the
moral
truth
informing
conscience
.



From
the
18
^
(th
)
century
on
,
increasing
numbers
of
philosophers
spoke
for
pragmatic
and
relativistic
ideas
about
conscience
.

 
John
Locke
wrote
about
how
a
moral
conscience
might
oppose
the
laws
of
the
state
,
and
Thomas
Hobbes
insisted
that
opinions
based
on
conscience
could
easily
be
wrong
or
in
contradiction
to
other
people’s
consciences
.

 
So
,
these
and
other
philosophers
also
advocated
for
a
‘critical
conscience’–and
some
skepticism
about
the
dictates
of
conscience
in
general
.



In
the
19
^
(th
)
century
,
Darwin
hypothesized
that
conscience
evolved
to
resolve
conflicts
between
instincts
,
such
as
between
instincts
for
self-preservation
and
instincts
to
protect
and
cooperate
with
other
human
beings
.



In
the
20
^
(th
)
century
,
Freud
analyzed
conscience
as
an
effect
of
the
super-ego
;
as
we
grow
up
,
natural
instincts
such
as
aggression
and
sexual
desire
must
be
frequently
frustrated
,
and
even
punished
,
by
---------------
them
.



Where
Darwin
said
that
conscience
evolved
to
resolve
inner
conflicts
,
other
more
recent
evolutionary
psychologists
suggest
that
it
evolved
to
motivate
altruistic
behavior
,
which
is
now
thought
to
be
evolutionarily
adaptive
for
social
creatures
.



Few
today
would
claim
that
conscience
is
a
source
of
objective
morality
,
divine
,
transcendental
or
otherwise
,
since
it
is
obvious
that
two
people’s
consciences
or
religions
can
dictate
opposing
moralities—such
as
pro-choice
and
pro-life
.

  
Therefore
,
philosophers
today
are
more
concerned
with
exploring
the
consequences
of
this
relativity
of
conscience
,
especially
since
people
still
seem
to
think
of
conscience
as
objectively
true
,
sacred
,
and
inviolable
.


Which
leads
naturally
to
our
controversy
–
“freedom
of
conscience
.

Conscience
in

Example
#1
:
Pinocchio
---------------

In
this
clip
from
the
old
Disney
Pinocchio
film
,
Jiminy
Cricket
gives
the
boy
who
would
be
human
a
lecture
and
song
about
conscience
with
the
message
“always
let
your
conscience
be
your
guide
.

” 
Although
that
message
implies
relying
on
intuitive
conscience
,
it’s
interesting
that
the
Cricket
first
tries
to
explain
something
like
‘critical
conscience’
to
Pinocchio
before
giving
up
in
confusion
and
falling
back
on
a
traditional
Christian
notion
of
conscience—resistance
to
temptation
.



Example

: Emperor’s
New
Groove
---------------

This
scene
from
the
Emperor’s
New
Groove
nicely
dramatizes
one
of
the
most
popular
conceptions
of
conscience
in
our
society—the
devil
and
angel
on
your
shoulders

This
colorful
and

image
seems
to
imply
that
true
morality
consists

Introduction

Each
of
us
has
,
at
one
time
or
another
,
talked
about
our
conscience
.


We
might
have
been
“pricked
by
our
conscience”
or
our
conscience
might
have
“butted
in”
when
it
was
not
wanted
.


We
might
be
going
on
quite
happily
telling
a
lie
to
a
friend
,
or
might
have
accidentally
walked
out
of
a
shop
without
paying
for
something
and
it
is
our
conscience
that
makes
us
confess
or
stops
us
in
our
tracks
spins
us
on
our
heels
and
takes
us
back
into
the
shop
.



People
from
different
walks
of
life
talk
of
the
“conscience”
,
from
the
religious
believer
,
the
politician
,
the
celebrity
,
to
every
day
folk
;
we
might
hear
someone
berate
their
conscience
for
nagging
them
to
do
something
they
do
not
want
to
.


People
might
be
labelled
“conscientious
objectors”
because
they
feel
their
conscience
is
telling
them
to
object
to
certain
political
actions
,
e
.

g
.


war
.


A
protester
might
lament
the
erosion
of
their
“freedom
of
conscience”
.


And
we
can
find
concepts
very
similar
to
“conscience”
in
many
non-Christian
religious
traditions
both
Eastern
and
Western
throughout
history
and
from
around
the
globe
.

However
,
the
nature
of
conscience
is
obscure
and
consequently
the
philosophical
discussion
of
conscience
is
complex
and
has
a
long
history
.


It
draws
on
issues
in
philosophical
psychology
,
philosophy
of
religion
,
epistemology
,
philosophy
of
mind
,
applied
ethics
,
normative
---------------

In
this
chapter
we’ll
give
a
general
overview
of
two
theories
of
conscience
.


One
draws
on
Aquinas’s
account
;
the
other
Sigmund
Freud’s

(1856–1939
)
.


Although
Freud
is
not
typically
seen
as
a
philosopher
(he’s
a
psychologist
)
his
account
will
provide
us
with
some
insights
which
allows
us
to
think
philosophically
about
this
thing
we
call
“the
conscience”
.

.


The
History
of
Conscience

In
the
twenty-first
century
conscience
is
not
thought
of
as
solely
a
religious
idea
.


However
talk
of
“conscience”
was
popularised
,
at
least
in
“the
West”
,
due
to
its
adoption
by
both
Protestant
and
Catholic
traditions
.


In
this
section
we’ll
look
how
“conscience”
is
,
and
has
been
,
used
in
order
to
draw
out
some
general
features
.



“Conscience”
played
a
role
in
one
of
the
most
famous
speeches
in
the
protestant
reformation
.


Martin
Luther
(1483–1546
)
,
being
charged
with
heresy
and
being
forced
to
recant
by
Charles
V
,
stands
his
grounds
and
says
“Here
I
stand
,
I
can
do
no
other”
and
“I
cannot
nor
will
I
retract
anything
,
since
it
is
never
safe
nor
virtuous
to
go
against
conscience”
.


Luther
believed
that
his
God-given
conscience
was
not
allowing
him
to
recant
,
not
even
under
the
considerable
pressure
by
the
powerful
people
before
him
.


Or
consider
a
more
recent
example
.


---------------
his
views
said
:

But
,
conscience
asks
the
question
,
is
it
right
?


And
there
comes
a
time
when
we
must
take
a
position
that
is
neither
safe
,
nor
politic
,
nor
popular
,
but
one
must
take
it
because
it
is
right
.

2

Conscience
is
,
then
,
powerful
.


It
seems
that
it
can
move
a
person
to
put
themselves
in
mortal
danger
,
to
“stand
up
and
be
counted”
,
to
act
contrary
to
self-interest
.



But
it
is
not
just
saints
and
heroes
that
talk
of
conscience
,
conscience
has
been
cited
by
the
most
repugnant
and
morally
abhorrent
people
who
have
ever
lived
,
racists
,
murderers
,
tyrants
,
dictators
.


For
example
as
Bettina
Stangneth’s
states
in
Eichmann
Before
Jerusalem
:
The
Unexamined
Life
of
a
Mass
Murderer
,3
a
discussion
of
the
inner
life
of
one
of
the
Nazi’s
most
notorious
officers
:
“Conscience
was
simply
the
‘morality
of
the
Fatherland
that
dwells
within’
a
person
,
which
Eichmann
also
termed
‘the
voice
of
the
blood’”
.



Conscience
can
be
male
or
female
or
both
or
neither
,
it
can
be
one
voice
or
many
,
it
can
echo
religious
ideas
,
social
ideas
,
racist
ideas
,
lofty
ideas
or
ideas
found
in
the
filth
of
human
corruption
.


Conscience
can
develop
at
any
particular
age
and
dissipates
at
any
age
.


It
does
not
“speak”
,
and
it
does
“speak”
,
and
does
not
have
a
language
of
choice
.


---------------

There
seem
to
be
(at
least
)
three
related
functions
that
we
think
the
conscience
plays
.


First
,
it
tells
us
what
we
ought
to
do
as
a
guide
for
our
lives
.


Second
,
it
is
a
source
of
moral
knowledge
.


That
is
,
we
might
say
“I
know
that
stealing
a
pen
is
wrong
because
my
conscience
told
me”
.


Third
it
might
be
thought
of
as
a
motivation
.


That
is
,
it
might
be
the
thing
that
actually
gets
us
up
out
of
our
seat
to
act
in
certain
ways
,
---------------

Just
to
clarify
,
we
can
see
the
difference
in
the
first
two
of
these
functions
if
we
think
of
a
tyrant
who
says
for
example
:
“my
conscience
tells
me
I
have
to
kill
all
mentally
ill
people
to
help
the
country”
.


Clearly
this
is
a
case
where
her
conscience
is
telling
her
how
she
ought
to
behave
.


But
,
given
that
we
think
that
killing
the
mentally
ill
is
morally
wrong
,
we
do
not
want
to
say
that
in
this
case
her
conscience
gives
her
knowledge
of
what
is
right
and
wrong
.


So
it
might
be
true
that
the
conscience
gives
us
guidance
but
not
knowledge
.



Equally
the
opposite
seems
true
,
that
we
might
know
what
is
right
and
wrong
yet
fail
to
be
guided
to
do
it
.


This
predicament
is
what
Shakespeare
captured
in
this
famous
quotation
:
“conscience
doth
make
cowards
of
us
all”
(Hamlet
3
.

1
.

78–82
)
.



Consider
another
point
.


Conscience
is
subjective
in
that
it
is
about
one
reflecting
inwards
on
oneself
,
on
how
one
might
“feel”
about
certain
things
.


It
is
not
about
looking
out
into
the
world
,
at
a
set
of
rules
or
laws
.


We
experience
the
conscience
differently
than
we
would
if
a
friend
,
priest
,
politician
or
Imam
was
telling
us
what
to
do
.


Of
course
,
although
conscience
is
“inward
looking”
,
that
is
not
the
same
as
saying
that
we
just
make
up
what
the
conscience
allegedly
tells
us
.


For
instance
,
we
might
think
that
what
is
right
and
wrong
is
dependent
on
God
but
also
think
that
we
come
to
know
what
is
right
and
wrong
through
our
conscience
.



Finally
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
term
“conscience”
was
only
formalized
in
its
modern
moral
meaning
in
the
mid
eighteenth
century

(e
.

g
.


neither
Plato
nor
Aristotle
talk
of
conscience
)
.


However
,
note
that
just
because
a
term
is
modern
,
or
just
because
there
is
disagreement
with
how
a
term
is
used
,
that
does
not
mean
that
the
ideas
---------------
scientific
community
.


This
in
itself
does
not
lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
there
are
no
molecules
and
no
atoms
.


So
the
lack
of
term
“conscience”
,
and
disagreement
about
what
“conscience”
means
does
not
mean
that
conscience
is
merely
an
“invention”
.


With
all
these
points
in
mind
let’s
consider
one
of
the
key
thinkers
in
relation
to
conscience
,
Aquinas
.

Aquinas
on
Conscience

If
you
recall
from
Aquinas
developed
a
Natural
Law
theology
.


The
basic
---------------

They
show
that
the
requirements
of
the
law
are
written
on
their
hearts
,
their
consciences
also
bearing
witness
,
and
their
thoughts
sometimes
accusing
them
and
at
other
times
even
defending
them
.

4

Notice
then
that
for
Paul
—
and
Aquinas
—
the
“conscience”
bears
witness
sometimes
accusing
the
person
,
sometimes
defending
them
.


For
Aquinas
conscience
is
morally
neutral
,
it
simply
“bears
witness”
,
it
is
a
“sign-post”
and
after
all
signposts
do
not
opinions
on
things
(see
Aquinas
,
Summa
,
Part
1
,
Question
79
,
Article
13
)
.



To
be
clear
then
Aquinas
did
not
take
conscience
to
be
a
source
of
moral
knowledge
but
as
a
guide
.


This
means
that
Aquinas
,
unlike
Luther
and
post-reformation
thinkers
,
took
conscience
to
be
fallible
.


For
Aquinas
we
may
be
wrong
in
following
our
conscience
as
it
can
move
us
in
the
wrong
direction/mislead
us

For
Aquinas
the
conscience
is
the
act
of
applying
the
universal
principles
(the
Eternal/Divine
law
)
to
actual
real
life
situations
.



Aquinas
explicitly
defines
“conscience”
as
the
“application
of
knowledge
to
activity”
(Summa
Theologica
,
I–II
,
I
)
.


So
,
if
conscience
for
Aquinas
is
about
the
application
of
knowledge
to
activity
,
this
raises
the
question
how
we
get
this
knowledge
?


This
is
where
another
key
technical
term
is
introduced
.


The
synderesis
.


Synderesis
is
not
the
same
as
conscience
but
is
the
innate
ability
of
the
mind
—
what
he
calls
a
habit
of
the
mind
—
to
apprehend
the
eternal/divine
laws
.


The
role
of
conscience
is
to
apply
the
primary
precepts
discovered
as
the
content
of
synderesis
.



---------------
reflection
they
will
see
that
it
is
the
straight
line
.


This
“coming
to
recognize
through
reflection”
is
what
Aquinas
has
in
mind
when
he
talks
about
synderesis
.


For
Aquinas
,
unlike
conscience
,
synderesis
is
never
mistaken
.


Humans
do
wrong
,
thinks
Aquinas
,
when
conscience
(and
not
synderesis
)
makes
a
mistake
.


This
means
that
a
failure
of
conscience
needs
to
be
clearly
thought
through
on
Aquinas’s
account
.



For
Aquinas
,
conscience
errs
because
of
ignorance
about
how
to
apply
the
eternal/divine
laws
,
of
which
there
are
two
types
.


Ignorance
that
can
be
overcome
by
using
one’s
reason
(vincible
ignorance
)
,
and
ignorance
that
---------------
Invincible
ignorance
is
doing
something
wrong
when
one
could
not
have
known
better
;
vincible
ignorance
is
doing
wrong
when
one
ought
to
have
known
better
.


But
how
might
this
relate
to
conscience
?



Imagine
two
people
going
into
a
gun
shop
.


The
first
person
has
no
---------------
and
they
have
no
record
of
mental
illness
.


He
is
,
for
all
intents
and
purposes
,
a
model
citizen
.


This
person
buys
a
gun
and
goes
on
a
killing
rampage
.


The
owner
of
the
shop
,
by
following
her
conscience
,
has
not
done
something
morally
wrong
because
her
ignorance
is
invincible
;
there
was
no
indication
that
this
would
have
been
a
likely
outcome
.


---------------
This
contrasts
to
the
person
who
is
sold
a
gun
even
though
he
has
a
violent
criminal
record
which
would
have
shown
up
on
a
basic
background
check
.


In
this
case
,
the
owner
of
the
gun
shop
following
her
conscience
has
done
something
morally
wrong
because
in
this
case
her
ignorance
is
vincible
.


---------------
and
wrong
through
synderesis
.


However
,
even
though
we
are
infallible
about
this
,
we
can
,
and
do
,
make
mistakes
in
applying
this
knowledge
.


It
is
our
conscience
(conscientia
)
which
tells
us
how
to
apply
this
knowledge
and
moves
us
to
act
.


It
can
go
wrong
through
ignorance
.


Ignorance
which
could
have
been
avoided
(vincible
)
means
our
action
is
---------------

In
the
next
section
,
we
will
consider
what
Freud
has
to
say
about
conscience
,
and
explain
how
he
reconceptualises
it
as
a
psychological
and
not
theological
concept
,
and
in
doing
so
argues
we
should
not
accept
it
as
an
inherently
good
notion
.

Freud
and
the
Conscience

Freud
is
best
known
as
a
psychologist
and
the
architect
of
---------------
talk
in
the
form
of
a
“Freudian
slip”
.


Among
Freud’s
many
ideas
his
conceptualization
of
the
structure
of
the
mind
is
key
to
his
views
on
conscience
.


He
thinks
the
mind
can
be
thought
of
as
containing
three
parts
:
the
id
,
the
ego
and
the
super-ego
.


Freud’s
account
of
conscience
is
understood
as
the
relation
between
these
.



---------------
from
the
super-ego
.



Where
does
the
conscience
come
in
?


For
Freud
the
conscience
is
the
form
that
the
super-ego
takes
in
addressing
the
ego
.


When
the
internalized
authority
derived
from
parental
(social/religious
)
rules
and
regulations
controls
the
ego
is
it
is
understood
as
“the
conscience”
.


In
our
last
example
it
is
our
“conscience”
that
tells
us
to
remove
our
elbows
from
the
table
.



Notice
then
that
our
conscience
often
requires
certain
things
from
us
which
we
fail
to
achieve
and
this
gives
rise
to
guilt
.


For
Freud
,
the
conscience
can
be
thought
of
as
synonymous
with
the
“guilty
conscience”
.


Our
ego
is
punished
through
guilt
by
the
form
of
the
super-ego
we
call
conscience
.


Furthermore
,
Freud
says
that
when
the
super-ego
fails
to
deal
properly
with
the
id
—
when
the
pleasure
principle
is
repressed
—
this
forms
what
he
calls
neurosis
.



You
can
also
hopefully
see
the
differences
between
Aquinas
and
Freud
.


First
,
the
obvious
point
is
that
for
Freud
the
conscience
is
not
the
voice
of
God
.


Second
,
unlike
Aquinas
,
Freud
thinks
that
the
conscience
could
be
bad
,
destructive
and
unhelpful
.


The
conscience
is
the
way
the
ego
experiences
the
authority
of
the
super-ego
.


But
the
super-ego
is
arrived
at
through
the
experiences
we
have
.


And
,
of
course
,
we
might
have
had
really
bad
experiences
growing
up
where
parents
are
stifling
,
overly
authoritarian
,
distant
,
cold
,
hard
,
violent
,
abusive
etc
.


In
these
sorts
of
cases
the
conscience
would
be
stifling
,
overly
authoritarian
,
distant
,
etc
.


This
means
that
although
Freud
does
not
think
we
can
,
or
should
,
get
rid
of
the
conscience
he
does
think
we
should
treat
it
with
a
healthy
dose
of
scepticism
and
hence
not
be
kowtowed
by
the
“guilt”
that
is
our
ego’s
punishment
for
falling
short
of
the
super-ego
;
conscience
is
the
product
of
our
often
non-ideal
upbringing
rather
than
a
divinely-inspired
force
for
good
.



---------------
generally
,
a
pursuit
of
pleasure
and
happiness
.


People
become
sexually
active
,
fall
in
love
and
get
married
.


This
is
the
stage
where
we
acquire
a
fully
developed
conscience
.



SUMMARY

The
notion
of
“conscience”
has
appeared
for
thousands
of
years
in
different
cultures
,
even
though
it
has
not
always
been
called
“conscience”
.


Modern
Christian
orthodoxy
popularised
it
and
characterised
it
in
relation
to
God’s
voice
,
and
guidance
.


Aquinas
thought
that
conscience
is
the
way
we
understand
how
to
apply
what
we
know
.


In
Aquinas’s
view
,
our
conscience
is
fallible
and
might
guide
us
wrongly
.


When
our
conscience
“gets
it
wrong”
we
can
be
either
culpable
—
through
vincible
ignorance
—
or
not
culpable
—
through
invincible
ignorance
.



Freud
is
less
convinced
that
conscience
is
a
force
for
good
,
and
he
is
certain
that
it
has
not
got
anything
to
do
with
God
.


For
Freud
conscience
can
be
either
a
good
or
bad
.


We
can
think
of
our
mind
as
having
three
parts
,
the
id
,
ego
and
super-ego
.


The
conscience
for
Freud
is
the
form
the
super-ego
takes
when
it
is
trying
to
keep
the
ego
in
line
.


It
is
internalized
as
the
voice
of
authority
.


The
super-ego
is
about
following
rules
but
those
rules
do
not
come
from
“on
high”
,
they
derive
from
the
upbringing
we
have
had
.


So
if
we
have
had
a
repressive
upbringing
then
the
super-ego
—
the
voice
of
conscience
—
will
be
repressive
.


How
we
develop
these
three
features
of
the
mind
is
through
what
Freud
calls
Psychosexual
Development
;

we
do
not

conscience
,
a
personal
sense
of
the
moral
content
of
one’s
own
conduct
,
intentions
,
or
character
with
regard
to
a
feeling
of
obligation
to
do
right
or
be
good
.


Conscience
,
usually
informed
by
acculturation
and
instruction
,
is
thus
generally
understood
to
give
intuitively
authoritative
judgments
regarding
the
moral
quality
of
single
actions
.


---------------
a
faculty
.


Ancient
Egyptians
,
for
example
,
were
urged
not
to
transgress
against
the
dictates
of
the
heart
,
for
one
“must
stand
in
fear
of
departing
from
its
guidance
.

”
In
some
belief
systems
,
conscience
is
regarded
as
the
voice
of
God
and
therefore
a
completely
reliable
guide
of
conduct
:
among
the
Hindus
it
is
considered
“the
invisible
God
who
dwells
within
us
.

”
Among
Western
religious
groups
,
the
Society
of
Friends
(or
Quakers
)
places
particular
emphasis
on
the
role
of
conscience
in
apprehending
and
responding
through
conduct
to
the
“Inner
Light”
of
God
.



Outside
the
context
of
religion
,
philosophers
,
social
scientists
,
and
psychologists
have
sought
to
understand
conscience
in
both
its
individual
and
universal
aspects
.


The
view
that
holds
conscience
to
be
an
innate
,
intuitive
faculty
determining
the
perception
of
right
and
wrong
is
called
intuitionism
.


The
view
that
holds
conscience
to
be
a
cumulative
and
subjective
inference
from
past
experience
giving
direction
to
future
conduct
is
called
empiricism
.


The
behavioral
scientist
,
on
the
other
hand
,
may
view
the
conscience
as
a
set
of
learned
responses
to
particular
social
stimuli
.


Another
explanation
of
conscience
was
put
forth
in
the
20th
century
by
Sigmund
Freud
in
his
postulation
of
the
superego
.


According
to
Freud
,
the
superego
is
a
major
element
of
personality
that
is
formed
by
the
child’s
incorporation
of
moral
values
through
parental
approval
or
punishment
.


The
resulting
internalized
set
of
prohibitions
,
condemnations
,
and
inhibitions
is
that
part
of
the
superego
known
as
conscience
.

What

Conscience

Your
individual
conscience
is
the
final
arbiter
of
what
is
right
or
wrong
.



“The
church
,
your
parents
,
grandma
,
no
one
has
the
right
to
suggest
that
your
conscience
is
wrong
or
that
your
conscience
makes
you
a
bad
Catholic
.

”

---------------
Theological
School

Our
conscience
can
be
described
as
our
knowledge
of
ourselves
,
our
awareness
of
the
moral
principles
we
are
committed
to
,
and
our
motivation
to
act
.



One
of
the
most
fundamental
teachings
in
the
Catholic
tradition
is
the
primacy
of
conscience
.


This
doctrine
states
that
Catholics
must
use
their
reason
to
discern
ethically
complex
situations
and
that
our
individual
consciences
should
be
the
final
arbiter
in
all
moral
decision-making
.



The
Catechism
of
the
Catholic
Church
states
that
we
have
the
right
to
act
in
conscience
and
in
freedom
to
make
moral
decisions
and
that
no
one
should
be
forced
to
act
contrary
to
their
consciences
.



As
Catholics
,
we
believe
that
we
must
use
all
of
the
resources
available
to
us
to
form
our
consciences
so
that
we
can
make
the
best
possible
decisions
for
ourselves
,
particularly
in
morally
complex
circumstances
.


We

this
is

But
we
are
conscious
of
the
fact
that
poverty
,
racism
and
other
forms
of
powerlessness
often
limit
the
possibility
of
using
one’s
conscience

For
this
reason

the
structures
of

that

people
into

Questions
about
Conscience

We
'
ve
compiled
these
talking
points
to
help
inform
Catholic
conversations
about
conscience
.



What
is
a
conscience
?



Our
conscience
is
our
capacity
to
judge
right
from
wrong
and
good
from
evil
.


It
is
an
internal
moral
compass
that
seeks
truth
and
wisdom
to
guide
own
behavior
and
decisions
.


One’s
conscience
draws
upon
moral
codes
that
come
from
religion
and
society
,
as
well
as
one’s
internal
belief
systems
and
personal
values
.



What
factors
inform
your
conscience
?



Many
factors
form
one’s
conscience
.


They
include
the
wisdom
of
one’s
religious
tradition
,
of
course
.


But
a
well-formed
conscience
also
incorporates
knowledge
from
other
sources
,
such
as
science
,
medicine
,
ethical
frameworks
and
our
own
experience
.



Are
there
limits
on
the
ways
in
which
we
can
use
our
conscience
?



One’s
individual
conscience
should
always
be
the
ultimate
authority
in
all
moral
decision-making
.


However
,
sinful
structures
of
gender
inequality
,
systemic
racism
,
economic
insecurity
and
immigration
status
can
limit
one’s
ability
to
make
choices
.


The
ability
to
use
one’s
conscience
and
make
choices
is
too
often
a
luxury
enjoyed
by
those
who
are
wealthy
,
white
and
privileged
.


As
Catholics
committed
to
a
rich
tradition
of
social
justice
teachings
,
we
must
dismantle
the
injustices
that
prevent
people
from
being
able
to
exercise
their
consciences
and
make
choices
for
themselves
.

[Everyone
Has
a
Purpose
,
Few
Have
a
Conscience
]

Purpose
is
the
raison
d’être
of
a
company
,
the
permanent
basis
of
its
strategy
.


Every
company
has
a
purpose
,
explicit
or
not
;
however
,
few
–
although
this
is
changing
–
have
a
conscience
.


To
be
clear
,
the
Mafia
has
a
purpose
,
but
consciousness
is
just
another
story
.



---------------

By
this
,
what
I
mean
is
that
everyone
has
a
purpose
,
even
the
Mafia
,
yet
few
have
a
conscience
and
even
fewer
are
specific
in
the
way
they
define
it
.



---------------

It
is
good
business
to
be
true
to
what
the
company
is
,
allowing
the
public
to
recognize
how
it
behaves
with
a
conscience
.


Although
,
in
addition
,
society
demands
a
positive
social
and
environmental
impact
from
the
company
,
this
does
not
mean
that
profit
motives
(which
are

Brands
trying
to
navigate
this
new
world
of
conscience
and
sincerity
should
act
differently
,
deeply
believing
in

[What
Is
Freedom
of
Conscience
,
and
Why
Does
It
Matter
?


]

What
is
“conscience”
?


It’s
a
word
we’re
all
familiar
with—a
clear
conscience
,
a
guilty
conscience—even
if
we
can’t
pinpoint
an
exact
definition
.



The
concept
pops
up
in
all
kinds
of
places
.


In
Saturday
morning
cartoons
where
good
guys
consult
an
angel
on
their
right
shoulder
(conscience
)
and
a
devil
on
their
left
shoulder
(temptation
)
before
making
a
decision
.


In
literary
masterpieces
like
Crime
and
Punishment
,
where
the
---------------
final
good
act
after
a
lifetime
of
evil
.



But
none
of
these
examples
capture
the
full
concept
of
conscience
.


As
Americans
,
we
should
consider
the
true
meaning
of
“conscience
.

”
We
should
also
recognize
the
importance—and
privilege—of
having
the
freedom
of
conscience
.


America
was
founded
on
this
freedom
.


And
it’s
worth
preserving
today
.



Read
on
to
find
out
why
.



What
is
freedom
of
conscience
?



Conscience
is
our
God-given
ability
to
discern
right
from
wrong
,
good
from
evil
.


But
it’s
more
than
that
.


For
knowing
right
from
wrong
wouldn’t
do
much
good
if
we
didn’t
(or
couldn’t
)
act
on
what’s
right
.


So
conscience
also
includes
the
ability
to
apply
laws
,
rules
,
and
intuitions
in
the
right
way
.


In
other
words
,
to
act
on
what
we
believe
.



---------------
action
by
serving
others
.



Where
is
freedom
of
conscience
found
in
the
Constitution
?



America’s
Founders
understood
the
gravity
of
protecting
the
freedom
of
conscience
.



James
Madison
called
conscience
“the
most
sacred
of
all
property
.

”
Thomas
Jefferson
said
that
no
“provision
in
our
constitution
ought
to
be
dearer
to
man
,
than
that
which
protects
the
rights
of
conscience
against”
the
government
.


And
during
the
debate
over
what
would
become
the
First
Amendment
,
many
lawmakers
proposed
protecting
the
rights
of
conscience
.



This
understanding
shaped
the
First
Amendment
.


Although
the
amendment
doesn’t
explicitly
mention
“conscience
,”
it
protects
its
animating
features
:
religious
freedom
and
free
speech
.


The
First
Amendment
says
,
“Congress
shall
make
no
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion
,
or
---------------
speech
,
or
of
the
press
.

”

Why
is
freedom
of
conscience
important
?



These
26
words
protect
the
freedom
of
conscience—the
freedom
to
believe
without
coercion
and
to
speak
and
act
consistently
with
those
beliefs
.



---------------
things
to
which
we
object
.


So
we
have
the
freedom
to
think
,
reason
,
speak
,
stay
silent
about
,
and
hold
certain
beliefs
without
fearing
government
punishment
.


That
protects
our
private
conscience
.



But
our
internal
beliefs
often
move
us
to
act
publicly
.


So
the
First
---------------

The
freedom
to
act
on
our
beliefs
is
important
because
community
standards—or
lack
thereof—reflect
individuals’
conscience
.


The
more
we
train
our
conscience
to
do
what
is
right
,
the
better
off
we
will
be
.


But
we
lose
our
ability
to
discern
right
from
wrong
the
more
we
consistently
ignore
our
conscience
.



The
freedom
of
conscience
has
also
benefitted
America’s
common
good
.


Because
of
this
freedom
,
religious
organizations
have
founded
and
currently
operate
countless
hospitals
,
homeless
shelters
,

What
are
some
court
cases
dealing
with
freedom
of
conscience
?



The
freedom
of
conscience
is
worth
preserving
.


Several
court
cases
seek
to
do
(and
have
done
)
just
that
.


Consider
three
contexts
:

---------------

2
.


The
freedom
of
medical
providers
to
decline
to
provide
medical
procedures
that
violate
their
conscience
.



3
.


The
freedom
of
faith-based
public-service
ministries
to
operate
in
line
with
their
religious
purpose
.



Freedom
of
conscience
for
artists

For
almost
eighty
years
,
the
U
.

S
.


Supreme
Court
has
recognized
that
---------------
its
laws
to
force
her
to
create
websites
promoting
messages
that
contradict
her
beliefs
about
marriage
.


Unwilling
to
violate
the
law
or
her
conscience
,
Lorie
challenged
the
law
to
protect
the
cherished
freedom
to
speak
consistently
with
her
religious
views
on
marriage
.

 

---------------
consistent
with
his
belief
about
the
immutability
of
sex
.


Lorie’s
victory
reaffirms
that
the
Supreme
Court
still
believes
in
the
importance
of
a
free
conscience
.


That’s
how
it
should
be
.


Every
American
has
the
right
to
speak
freely
.


That’s
why
Lorie
found
support
from
a
diverse
group
of
artists—from
a
world-renowned
graphic
designer
to
a
---------------
artist
who
hold
different
views
about
marriage
.



Freedom
of
conscience
for
health-care
professionals

Beyond
speech
,
the
freedom
of
conscience
is
imperative
in
the
medical
field
.


Since
ancient
times
,
physicians
have
sworn
to
“do
no
harm”
to
their
patients
.


Fast
forward
to
present
day
,
and
professional
medical
ethics
acknowledge
the
rights
of
professionals
to
decline
to
provide
medical
treatment
that
violates
their
conscience
.



The
justification
echoes
the
First
Amendment—to
preserve
the
personal
---------------
the
case
must
proceed
.



Freedom
of
conscience
for
faith-based
ministries

The
freedom
of
conscience
allows
faith-based
ministries
to
provide
other
public
services
to
care
for
the
most
vulnerable
among
us
.


For
example
,
ADF
has
twice
defended
Downtown
Hope
Center
,
a
Christian
nonprofit
---------------
These
ministries
provide
critical
services
to
their
communities
.


And
they
do
so
because
of
their
religious
beliefs
.


This
is
a
common
feature
of
American
history
made
possible
by
the
freedom
of
conscience
.


In
that
way
,
protecting
the
ability
of
these
ministries
to
live
out
their
faith
ensures
that
other
religious
organizations
can
do
the
same
while
---------------
Conclusion

By
now
,
we’ve
answered
the
original
question—what
is
conscience
?


And
we’ve
answered
another—
why
is
freedom
of
conscience
worth
preserving
?



In
the
end
,
this
freedom
recognizes
the
inherent
dignity
of
each
person

As

[edit

The
conscience
clause
is
widely
invoked
in

and
agencies

contraceptives

and

treatments

Opponents
of
related
FOCA
legislation
have
interpreted
the
possible
end
of

clause
as
a
demand
to
either
"do
abortions

How
SB
1580
Defines
‘Right
of
Medical
Conscience’
and
Free
Speech
in
Health
Care
By
Jeff
Scott
,
Esq
.


,
FMA
General
Counsel

---------------

It
is
the
intent
of
the
Legislature
to
provide
the
right
of
medical
conscience
for
health
care
providers
and
payors
to
ensure
they
can
care
for
patients
in
a
manner
consistent
with
their
moral
,
ethical
,
and
religious
convictions
.


Further
,
it
is
the
intent
of
the
Legislature
that
licensed
health
care
providers
and
payors
be
free
from
threat
of
discrimination
for
providing
conscience-based
health
care
.



This
Legislature
coupled
this
“right
of
medical
conscience”
with
a
provision
protecting
the
“use
of
free
speech
by
a
health
care
practitioner”
to
create
a
comprehensive
legislative
package
that
was
a
priority
of
Gov
.


Ron
DeSantis
.


This
analysis
of
SB
1580
will
attempt
to
explain
how
these
two
new
provisions
affect
the
practice
of
medicine
.


Right
of
Medical
Conscience
SB
1580
creates
a
new
section
of
the
Florida
Statutes¹
that
gives
health
care
providers
(and
health
care
payors
)
the
right
to
“opt
out
of
participation
in
or
payment
for
any
health
care
service
on
the
basis
of
a
conscience-based
objection
.

”
It
is
important
to
note
that
this
right
of
conscience
only
applies
to
a
“health
care
service
.

”
It
does
not
give
a
health
care
provider
the
right
to
refuse
to
perform
job
requirements
that
do
not
involve
the
provision
---------------
performed
or
provided
by
any
health
care
provider
.



If
a
health
care
provider
has
a
conscience-based
objection
to
performing
abortions
,
the
provider
may
not
be
discriminated
against
or
suffer
adverse
action
for
refusing
to
perform
abortions
.


However
,
a
provider
---------------
patients
based
on
the
patient’s
race
,
color
,
religion
,
sex
,
or
national
origin
.


The
right
of
conscience
is
solely
attached
to
a
specific
health
care
service
.


A
provider
can
refuse
to
prescribe
contraceptives
to
his/her
patients
but
cannot
refuse
to
prescribe
contraceptives
to
only
Medicaid
---------------
procedure
to
his/her
patients
may
not
refuse
to
provide
that
procedure
to
a
subset
of
patients
who
engage
in
a
certain
type
of
behavior
,
even
if
the
provider
has
a
conscience-based
objection
to
that
behavior
.


While
the
bill
sponsors
made
it
clear
as
to
what
the
right
of
conscience
applies
to
,
they
left
the
issue
of
whether
a
conscientious
objection
exists
less
certain
.


SB
1580
defines
a
“conscience-based
objection”
as
an
objection
based
on
a
sincerely
held
religious
,
moral
,
or
ethical
belief
.

²
As
noted
in
the
footnote
,
whether
an
entity
such
as
an
insurance
company
has
a
conscience
is
determined
by
existing
written
evidence
.


If
the
articles
of
incorporation
for
an
insurer
state
that
the
company
exists
to
provide
health
insurance
for
individuals

requirement

.


If
the
company
cannot
produce
a
governing
document
,
published
guideline
,
or
set
of
policies
or
regulations
,
it
will
not
be
entitled
to
assert
a
right
of
conscience
.


Individual
health
care
providers³
,
on
the
other
hand
,
do
not
have
to
produce
written
evidence
attesting
to
a
sincerely
held
religious
,
moral

---------------
General
,
as
the
entity
given
enforcement
authority
for
this
statute
,
to
determine
whether
a
health
care
provider
alleging
a
violation
has
a
valid
conscience-based
objection
.


Presumably
,
the
Attorney
General
will
assess
a
provider’s
self-professed
belief
on
a
case-by-case
basis
in
a
manner
congruent
with
the
inquiry
used
for
similar
laws
,
such
as
Title

held

beliefs

.


Health
care
providers
and
payors
who
wish
to
opt
out
of
participation
in
or
payment
for
a
health
care
service
due
to
a
conscience-based
objection
must
do
the
following
:

---------------

patient’s
medical
file
.


-
Notify
patients
seeking
an
appointment
for
a
health
care
service

that
the
provider
has
a
conscience-based
objection
to
of
that

objection
before
scheduling
the
appointment
.


-
Providers
who
are
students
must
provide
written
notice
of
their

conscience-based
objection
to
the
educational
institution
at
the

time
the
objection
is
made
or
as
soon
as
practicable
.



Providers
who
comply
with
these
requirements
may
not
be
discriminated
against⁴
or
suffer
adverse
action⁵
for
exercising
their
right
of
medical
conscience
.


The
right
of
medical
conscience
section
also
includes
speech
and
whistle-blower
protections
,
which
prohibit
discriminating
or
taking
adverse
action
against
health
care
providers
or
payors
who
report
violations
of
the
new
right
of
medical
conscience
statute
.


This
protection
is
extended
to
providers
who
testify
,
assist
or
participate
in
a
proceeding
brought
by
the
Attorney
General
to
determine
if

---------------
Interestingly
,
this
part
of
the
new
law
also
includes
a
prohibition
on
discriminating
against
a
health
care
provider
or
payor
for
reasons
not
related
to
the
right
of
medical
conscience
.


Protection
from
discrimination
is
extended
to
the
disclosure
of
information
the
provider
or
payor
reasonably
believes
constitutes
:
---------------
Under
the
original
House
companion
to
SB
1580
,
health
care
providers
and
payors
were
given
a
civil
cause
of
action
for
any
violation
of
the
right
of
conscience
section
.


SB
1580
,
however
,
rejected
this
approach
in
favor
of
allowing
the
Attorney
General
to
investigate
complaints
and
bring
a
civil
action
for
damages
,
injunctive
or
other
appropriate
relief
,
and
attorney
fees
.


Health
care
providers
and
payors
who
decline
to
participate
in
or
pay
for
a
health
care
service
because
of
a
conscience-based
objection
may
not
be
held
civilly
liable
on
that
basis
alone
.


Finally
,
acknowledging
the
existence
of
federal
EMTALA
requirements
,
the
Legislature
specifically
stated
that
the
medical
conscience
section
does
not
override
any

federal
requirement
to
provide
emergency

treatment

Freedom
of
conscience
is
one
of
the
fundamental
freedoms
protected
by
section
2
of
the Canadian
Charter
of
Rights
and
Freedoms
.


[1
]

What
is
the
legal
impact
of
this
freedom
?



Ultimately
,
the
freedom
of
conscience
constitutionally
recognizes
“the
centrality
of
individual
conscience
and
the
inappropriateness
of
governmental
intervention
…
to
constrain
its
manifestation
.

”
[2
] In
fact
,
the
Supreme
Court
has
ruled
that
“an
emphasis
on
individual
conscience
and
individual
judgment
…
lies
at
the
heart
of
our
democratic
political
tradition
.


The
ability
of
each
citizen
to
make
free
and
informed
---------------
What
is
legally
protected
from
government
interference
?



The
only
Supreme
Court
case
considering
the
freedom
of
conscience
directly
is R
v
Morgentaler
.


[4
]
This
1988
case
dealt
with
the
constitutionality
of
abortion
laws
.


Justice
Wilson
stated
:
“
[t
]he
decision
whether
or
not
to
terminate
a
pregnancy
is
essentially
a
moral
decision
and
…
the
conscience
of
the
individual
must
be
paramount
.

”
[5
] She
also
held
that
the
freedoms
guaranteed
by
section
2
(a
)
“should
be
broadly
construed
to
extend
to
conscientiously-held
---------------

Without
guidance
from
the
Supreme
Court
,
lower
courts
have
had
to
figure
out
on
their
own
what
the
freedom
of
conscience
protects
.


From
the
limited
jurisprudence
that
exists
,
we
know
“
[t
]he
guarantee
of
freedom
of
conscience
…
is
directed
at
an
individual
'
s
overarching
…
normative
value
system
.

”
[7
] If
a
person’s
actions
are
not
motivated
by
a
“comprehensive
value
system”
(in
a
secular
context
)
,
 then
they
are
not
protected
by
section
2
(a
)
.


[8
] This
can
be
quite
limiting
:
when
people
have
argued
that
their
freedom
of
conscience
was
violated
by
mandatory
seatbelt
laws
for
example
,
their
arguments
failed
because
their
objections
were
not
supported
by
a
comprehensive
value
system
.



‘Insubstantial’
infringements
upon
a
person’s
conscience
are
also
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
guarantee
.


[9
] This
is
a
limitation
that
all
the
fundamental
freedoms
share
:
the freedom
of
religion for
instance
---------------

One
of
the
few
lower
court
decisions
solely
considering
the
freedom
of
conscience
,
rather
than
conscience
and
religion
together
,
was Maurice
v
Canada
(Attorney
General
)
.


[11
]
Mr
.


Maurice
wanted
to
receive
vegetarian
meals
in
prison
.


Originally
,
he
was
provided
with
these
meals
in
---------------
successfully
claimed
that
,
since
he
remained
vegetarian
for
conscientious
reasons
,
this
was
a
violation
of
his
freedom
of
conscience
.


[12
] The
Federal
Court
agreed
,
declaring
that
the
“Charter …
entitle
[s
]
the
Applicant
to
a
vegetarian
diet
.

”
[13
]

The
freedom
of
conscience
garnered
some
attention
in
2015
when
the
Supreme
Court
decided Carter
v
Canada
(Attorney
General
)
.


In
that
case
,
a
number
of
interveners
claimed
that
providing
access
to
physician-assisted
dying
would
infringe
the
freedom
of
conscience
of
medical
professionals
.


[14
] This
argument
went
beyond
the
scope
of
what
needed
to
be
decided
in
that
case
.


However
the
Court
noted
that
physician-assisted
dying
was
indeed
a
“matter
of
conscience”
and
that
at
some
point
“the Charter
rights
of
patients
and
physicians
will
need
to
be
reconciled
.

”
[15
]

What
are
the
limitations
on
the
freedom
of
conscience
?



While
the
freedom
of
conscience
is
a
fundamental
freedom
,
it
is
not
absolute
.


As
with
all
other
rights
and
freedoms
in
the Charter
,
if
a
breach
of
this
freedom
is
found
by
a
court
,
the
government
can
argue

The
Modern
Misunderstanding
of
Conscience

The
Catholic
Church
teaches
that
the
conscience
is
a
natural
facility
of
our
reason
that
directs
us
to
do
good
and
avoid
evil
;
that
makes
judgments
about
the
good
and
evil
of
particular
acts
;
and
that
bears
witness
after
the
fact
to
the
good
or
evil
that
we
have
done
,
such
as
what
we
call
“having
a
guilty
conscience
.

”¹

A
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
the
role
of
the
human
conscience
lies
at
the
root
of
many
of
the
problems
in
the
Catholic
Church
today
.


Very
few
Catholics
even
know
what
that
role
actually
is
.


When
pressed
,
many
will
say
something
along
the
lines
of
“If
my
conscience
tells
me
that
a
particular
action
is
all
right
,
I
can
do
it
.

”

This
is
just
another
way
of
saying
“If
it
feels
good
,
do
it
.

”
If
an
improperly-formed
conscience
leads
a
person
to
accept
something
as
right
and
good
based
simply
on
his
or
her
uninformed
opinions
and
feelings
,
that
person
will
fall
into
grave
errors
for
which
there
is
no
good
---------------

they
are
a
law
to
themselves
,
even
though
they
do
not
have
the
law
.



They
show
that
what
the
law
requires
is
written
on
their
hearts
,
while

their
conscience
also
bears
witness
and
their
conflicting
thoughts

accuse
or
perhaps
excuse
them
on
that
day
when
,
according
to
my

gospel
,
God
judges
the
secrets
of
men
by
Christ
Jesus
.


(Romans

2
:14-15
)

Many
Catholics
erroneously
believe
that
the
conscience
is
a
teacher
,
not
a
pupil
;
that
it
is
the
source
of
morality
.


This
is
not
the
teaching
of
the
Catholic
Church
.


According
to
the
Church
,
the
conscience
is
a
witness
to
the
moral
law
authored
by
God
.


Each
Catholic
is
required
to
obey
that
moral
law
in
all
things
.


The
conscience
,
if
properly
formed
,
calls
him
to
obey
that
moral
law
and
helps
him
to
understand
how
to
apply
it
in
particular
cases
.


---------------
Result
:
A
Deformed
Belief
System

The
belief
that
the
conscience
is
a
moral
authority
in
its
own
right
has
resulted
in
Catholics
supporting
and
promoting
many
intrinsic
evils
,
including
contraception
,
sterilization
,
abortion
,
homosexual
activity
,
---------------

Many
organizations
vigorously
promote
this
false
understanding
of
the
human
conscience
in
order
to
gain
more
support
from
Catholic
laity
.


One
of
these
groups
is
“Catholics”
for
Choice
(CFC
)
,
whose
mission
consists
of
attempting
to
convince
people
that
they
can
be
pro-abortion
and
still
be
“good
Catholics
.

”
In
its
quarterly
magazine
,
ironically
entitled
Conscience
,
CFC
attempts
to
legitimize
the
obvious
paradox
that
“Church
law
affirms
both
the
right
and
the
responsibility
of
a
Catholic
to
follow
his
or
her
conscience
,
even
when
it
conflicts
with
church
teaching”²
(emphasis
added
)
.



CFC
also
alleges
:


The
Catholic
Church
officially
teaches
that
the
conscience
of
an

individual
is
supreme
.


If
you
carefully
examine
your
conscience
and

then
decide
that
an
abortion
is
the
most
moral
act
you
can
do
at
this

time
,
you
are
not
committing
a
sin
.


Therefore
,
you
are
not
---------------
It
is
easy
to
demonstrate
that
CFC
does
not
really
believe
this
principle
itself
.


For
example
,
would
it
concede
that
it
was
legitimate
for
someone
to
“carefully
examine
their
conscience”
and
then
decide
that
torching
an
abortion
clinic
in
the
middle
of
the
night
was
“the
most
moral
act
they
could
do
at
this
time
?

”
---------------
gay-straight
alliance
whose
purpose
is
to
disseminate
homophile
propaganda
in
the
schools
is
“the
embodiment
of
a
perfectly-formed
Catholic
conscience
.

”
She
dismissed
her
critics
,
who
quoted
actual
Church

on
homosexuality
,
as
“archaic

Personal
Judgement
vs
.


Objective
Standards

How
does
conscience
relate
to
morality
?



In
order
for
a
person’s
conscience
to
be
conditioned
to
accept
evil
,
it
must
first
decisively
turn
away
from
God’s
teachings
and
decide
that
it
can
determine
for
itself
what
is
right
and
wrong
,
ignoring
all
external
---------------
This
means
that
dissenters
must
justify
their
claims
by
assuming
that
there
is
no
fixed
morality
that
is
binding
on
all
persons
.


The
only
source
of
morality
is
the
conscience
of
each
individual
.


One
phrase
that
is
coming
into
common
usage
among
the
self-appointed
elite
is
“This
is
my
truth
.

”

would
permit

---------------
It
is
one
thing
for
a
person
to
say
“I
disagree
with
the
Church’s
teaching
on
abortion
.

”
It
is
another
thing
entirely
to
say
“The
Church
teaches
that
abortion
is
permissible
,
so
long
as
my
conscience
allows
it

”
This
statement
is
false
,
and
can
only
be
uttered
by
one
who
is
grossly
ignorant
of
Church
teaching
or
who
deliberately
lies
about
such
---------------

A
person
is
culpable
for
the
evil
he
commits
when
he
“takes
little
trouble
to
find
out
what
is
true
and
good
,
or
when
conscience
is
by
degrees
almost
blinded
through
the
habit
of
committing
sin
.

---------------
 

The
Formation
of
the
Conscience

The
conscience
is
a
precious
gift
and
it
must
be
cared
for
by
forming
it
with
prayer
and
education
for
the
duration
of
our
lives
.



The
Catechism
states
,
“The
education
of
conscience
is
indispensable
for
human
beings
who
are
subjected
to
negative
influences
and
tempted
by
sin
to
prefer
their
own
judgment
and
to
reject
authoritative
teachings”

(¶1783
)
.



A
dead
giveaway
that
a
person’s
conscience
is
improperly
formed
is
when
he
or
she
says
something
like
“I
respect
the
teachings
of
the
Church
,
but
I
follow
my
own
conscience
in
matters
of
sexual
morality
.

”
Nancy
Pelosi
gave
us
a
typical
example
of
this
deception
when
she
claimed
that
she
was
a
“practicing
and
respectful
Catholic”
but
,
regarding
the
---------------
position
is
.

”⁶

This
means
that
the
person’s
conscience
has
become
disconnected
from
the
truth
.


This
has
several
root
causes
(Catechism
,
¶1792
)
:

---------------
-
Bad
example
given
by
others
,
-
Enslavement
to
one’s
passions
,
-
Assertion
of
a
mistaken
notion
of
autonomy
of
conscience
,
-
Rejection
of
the
Church’s
authority
and
her
teaching
,
-
Lack
of
conversion
and
of
charity
.

”

By
contrast
,
a
properly‑formed
Catholic
conscience
has
been
rigorously
educated
,
is
fully
aware
of
the
intrinsically
evil
nature
of
abortion
and
other
evils
,
and
is
led
by
this
knowledge
to
vigorously
oppose
them
.


---------------
Failure
to
act
is
not
a
viable
option
.



It
is
true
that
Catholics
must
follow
their
consciences
,
but
their
consciences
must
be
formed
by
the
Word
of
God
,
which
is
authentically
interpreted
and
taught
by
the
Magisterium
of
the
Catholic
Church
,
to
which
Christ
entrusted
His
authority
to
teach
in
His
Name
.


The
conscience
must
be
continuously
schooled
to
recognize
,
not
to
determine
,
what
is
and
is
not
moral
activity
.



As
the
Catechism
teaches
,
“Objective
rules
of
morality
express
the
rational
order
of
good
and
evil
,
attested
to
by
conscience
.

…
It
is
by
the
judgment
of
conscience
that
man
perceives
and
recognizes
the
prescriptions
of
the
divine
law”
(¶1751
,
1778
)
.

Conscience
and
Vatican
II

Some
appeal
to
an
ill‑defined
“Spirit
of
Vatican
II”
to
support
their
concept
of
the
human
conscience
.


They
use
vague
terms
such
as
“renewal
,”
“reinvigoration”
and
“rejuvenation”
of
the
Church
,
while
consciously
misrepresenting
what
the
documents
of
the
Council
actually
say
.


They
often
quote
the
Vatican
II
document
Dignitatis
Humanae
(“Declaration
on
Religious
Freedom”
)
in
support
of
their
contention
that
people
should
be
able
to
do
anything
their
uneducated
consciences
do
not
object
to
.

⁷

However
,
this
is
obviously
not
what
the
Fathers
of
Vatican
II
taught
.


They
instead
laid
out
very
clearly
the
multiple
dangers
inherent
in
this
line
of
thinking
.


In
Gaudium
et
Spes
,
they
wrote
,
“Conscience
frequently
errs
from
invincible
ignorance
without
losing
its
dignity
.


The
same
cannot
be
said
for
a
man
who
cares
but
little
for
truth
and
goodness
,
or
for
a
conscience
which
by
degrees
grows
practically
sightless
as
a
result
of
habitual
sin”
(¶16‑17
)
.


Furthermore
,
the
document
notes
that
“not
a
few
can
be
found
who
seem
inclined
to
use
the
name
of
freedom
as
---------------

The
document
continues
by
confirming
an
essential
principle
:
That
the
conscience
must
submit
itself
to
the
authority
of
the
Church
:


In
forming
their
consciences
,
the
Christian
faithful
must
give
careful

attention
to
the
sacred
and
certain
teaching
of
the
Church
.


For
the

Catholic
Church
is
by
the
will
of
Christ
the
teacher
of
truth
.


Her
---------------

itself
.


(¶14
)

Conscience
does
have
a
very
particular
and
necessary
role
given
by
God
.


As
defined
in
Romans
2
:12‑16
and
Jeremiah
31
:33
,
God
imprints
the
natural
law
on
the
heart
and
soul
of
man
,
and
this
leads
him
to
know
whether
or
not
an
act
is
moral
or
evil
.

⁹
This
means
that
the
“natural
law”
is
man’s
instinctual
knowledge
of
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
―
his
“conscience
.

”
However
,
the
conscience
must
work
with
the
teachings
of
the
Church
,
never
against
it
.



---------------

The
Church
,
as
demonstrated
in
a
particularly
vivid
manner
by
Her
martyrs
,
has
always
held
that
a
person’s
properly-formed
conscience
may
never
be
violated
.


Countless
men
,
women
and
even
children
have
courageously
stated
,
“You
may
kill
me
,
but
you
will
never
force
me
to
violate
my
conscience
.

”

This
principle
has
more
recently
been
recognized
by
secular
authorities
.


---------------
Rights
and
its
1966
International
Covenant
on
Civil
and
Political
Rights
,
states
that
“everyone
has
the
right
to
freedom
of
thought
,
conscience
and
religion
.

”

When
society
fails
to
acknowledge
conscience
as
a
human
right
and
does
not
provide
protections
for
individuals
to
follow
their
own
consciences
,
grave
conflicts
inevitably
result
.


Either
people
will
heroically
obey
their
consciences
whatever
the
cost
,
or
they
will
lose
their
moral
integrity
with
all
the
devastating
effects
that
flow
from
this
on
society
at
large
.


---------------

Tragically
,
many
Catholics
possess
a
fatally
flawed
concept
of
conscience
,
denying
the
need
for
formation
in
the
truth
,
and
treating
mere
desire
as
an
absolute
.


Conscience
is
indeed
a
decision-maker
,
but
it
must
be
freely
submitted
to
the
law
of
God
,
to
which
it
is
a
witness
,
not
an
arbiter
.



The
error
lies
not
in
affirming
the
freedom
of
conscience
to
decide
,
but
in
misinterpreting
the
nature
of
such
freedom
.


Freedom
of
conscience
must
be
at
the
service
of
moral
truth
but
can
never
be
its
determinant
.

Nowhere

the
theory

that

the
Role

Conscience
in
Making
Moral
Decisions

 
[Examining

Role
of
Conscience
in

Decisions

Q
:
I
disagree
with
some
of
the
teachings
of
the
Catholic
Church
.


I
was
once
told
that
I
don’t
have
to
follow
all
of
the
church’s
teachings
if
they
violate
my
conscience
.


But
still
,
I’m
not
sure
that’s
right
.



A
:
First
,
I
want
to
commend
you
for
asking
this
question
.


The
fact
that
---------------
asked
someone
who
ought
to
be
able
to
give
some
guidance
on
what
was
a
difficult
moral
question
.


In
response
,
they
seemed
to
get
an
answer
that
indicated
that
,
in
the
end
,
they
had
to
just
“follow
their
conscience
.

”

I
can
understand
this
.


In
the
course
of
my
life
as
a
priest
,
I
have
---------------
right
decision-making
,
the
right
way
to
go
remained
foggy
and
difficult
.




“When
he
listens
to
his
conscience
,
the
prudent
man
can
hear
God

speaking”
—CCC
1777

In
addition
,
the
Catechism
of
the
Catholic
Church
teaches
:
“When
he
listens
to
his
conscience
,
the
prudent
man
can
hear
God
speaking”
(CCC
1777
)
.


Because
of
this
line
and
others
that
highlight
the
importance
of
conscience
,
it
is
tempting
to
take
the
default
position
of
“whatever
you
feel
is
right
,
just
do
that
.

”

---------------
true
.



Second
,
the
church’s
teaching
on
conscience
presumes
knowledge
of
the
moral
law
.


This
means
that
those
who
are
exercising
conscience
know
that
there
is
a
real
right
and
a
real
wrong
.


Unfortunately
,
there
are
fewer
people
who
acknowledge
this
reality
.


This
places
us
in
a
unique
place
in
---------------
a
nationwide
study
on
the
moral
life
of
18-
to
29-year-olds
.


His
conclusion
was
that
this
age
group
,
generally
speaking
,
has
neither
the
vocabulary
nor
the
categories
to
make
moral
decisions
.


If
conscience
depends
on
principles
of
right
and
wrong
,
how
will
these
young
people
make
decisions
?


According
to
Smith
,
they
base
their
decisions
on
feelings
.



But
conscience
is
not
a
feeling
.


The
catechism
clearly
states
that
conscience
“formulates
its
judgments
according
to
reason
,
in
conformity
with
the
true
good
willed
by
the
wisdom
of
the
Creator”
(CCC
1783
)
.


This
means
employing
one’s
mind
more
than
one’s
emotions
to
make
decisions
.


Conscience
is
not
merely
some
feeling
we
get
;
it
is
the
critical
application
of
truth
to
the
present
issue
.



Third
,
it
is
true
that
,
a
person
“must
not
be
forced
to
act
contrary
to
his
conscience
.


Nor
must
he
be
prevented
from
acting
according
to
his
conscience
,
especially
in
religious
matters”
(CCC
1782
)
.


But
this
does
not
mean
doing
whatever
pleases
me
.



---------------
the
church’s
constant
teaching
against
artificial
birth
control
in
the
document
“Humanae
Vitae
,”
many
couples
were
encouraged
to
dismiss
this
teaching
if
it
“violated
their
conscience
.

”
Unfortunately
,
as
a
result
,
many
couples
were
obliquely
encouraged
to
invite
a
sinful
practice
into
their
sexual
relationship
.


Even
more
,
they
were
led
to
believe
that
they
---------------

Because
that
is
all
this
comes
down
to
.


The
church’s
teaching
on
contraception
does
not
“violate”
a
person’s
conscience
.


Unless
a
person
truly
believed
that
periodic
abstinence
in
marriage
was
an
evil
(which
is
all
that
is
being
asked
for
through
natural
family
planning
)
,
then
there
is
no
conscience
issue
here
.


It
is
an
issue
of

not
knowing
or
understanding
the
church’s
teaching
(which
could
be
remedied
by
asking

lacking

After
all
of
this

if

What
is
Freedom
of
Conscience
?




Whether
they’re
happening
inside
the
Church
or
out
in
the
public
square
,
debates
about
how
far
freedom
of
conscience
extends
can
be
confusing
.


Should
Christians
be
compelled
to
take
a
vaccine
that’s
been
tested
on
the
fetal
remains
of
an
aborted
child
?


Should
Christian
business
owners
have
a
right
to
refuse
a
service
that
would
violate
their
conscience
,
like
baking
a
wedding
cake
for
a
same-sex
ceremony
?


How
do
Christians
respond
to
government
mandates
or
policies
that
they
cannot
follow
in
good
conscience
?


And
how
do
we
deal
with
conscientious
disagreement
within
the
Church
?



The
specifics
of
freedom
of
conscience
can
be
complex
and
nuanced
and
are
often
misunderstood
.


Abraham
Kuyper
called
the
conscience
:

“the
shield
of
the
human
person
,
the
root
of
civil
liberties
,
the
source
---------------

Why
is
it
so
important
?


To
answer
that
question
,
let’s
begin
by
looking
at
what
the
conscience
is
and
is
not
.



What
is
“conscience”
?



Definitions
of
conscience
vary
,
but
they
center
around
the
idea
of
what
someone
believes
to
be
right
and
wrong
.


The
conscience
is
a
moral
compass
that
helps
direct
people’s
actions
.


In
that
sense
,
conscience
is
personal
and
subjective
because
it
condemns
or
excuses
one’s
own
conduct
,
not
that
of
another
person
–
after
all
,
you
don’t
get
a
guilty
conscience
because
of
someone
else’s
behavior
.



However
,
conscience
is
also
based
on
an
objective
and
general
standard
.


The
Bible
explains
that
the
conscience
is
given
by
God
to
both
Christians
and
non-Christians
and
it
helps
people
apply
their
knowledge
of
right
and
wrong
to
their
behavior
,
both
past
actions
and
decisions
about
future
actions
.


The
New
Testament
also
speaks
of
the
importance
of
having
a
good
conscience
by
following
its
direction
and
doing
what
is
right
(see
Rom
.


2
:15
,
1
Tim
.


1
:5
)
.




[
]Christian
political
scientist
David
Koyzis
,
in
his
book
We
Answer
to
Another
,
tells
a
story
about
the
Milgram
Experiment
which
relates
well
to
conscience
.


The
experiment
was
a
study
designed
to
look
at
how
people
respond
to
authority
.


The
experimenter
would
select
two
participants
and
assign
one
the
role
of
teacher
,
while
another
volunteer
would
be
given
---------------
and
answerable
to
a
higher
authority
.



Ultimately
,
the
foundation
for
freedom
of
conscience
is
found
in
the
sovereignty
of
God
.


Every
human
being
has
various
authorities
in
their
lives
,
such
as
parents
,
employers
,
church
leadership
,
or
civil
government
.


Each
of
these
has
legitimate
authority
over
us
,
but
that
authority
is
also
limited
.


The
only
One
who
is
sovereign
over
the
conscience
is
God
,
and
if
another
authority
commands
us
to
do
what
we
believe
is
sin
–
what
we
believe
violates
how
God
wants
us
to
act
–
then
we
can
appeal
to
freedom
of
conscience
.


The
conscience
is
a
shield
that
protects
against
the
abuse
of
authority
and
points
instead
to
the
one
Higher
Authority
.



Conscience
and
the
public
square

Debates
around
conscience
are
becoming
increasingly
relevant
in
our
society
and
are
most
noticeable
within
certain
vocations
.


Can
medical
professionals
refuse
to
help
a
patient
access
abortion
,
assisted
---------------

Today
it’s
often
Christians
who
are
being
pressured
to
violate
their
conscience
.


However
,
there
are
others
who
seek
the
same
protections
for
their
conscience
.


It’s
this
freedom
that
an
atheist
doctor
appeals
to
when
he
determines
he
cannot
participate
in
euthanasia
,
based
on
his
oath
to
do
no
harm
.


And
what
of
the
fashion
designers
,
back
in
2016
,
who
---------------

For
Christians
,
the
answer
to
the
questions
above
might
be
easy
.


But
we
have
our
own
disputes
about
conscience
within
the
Church
as
well
,
such
as
what
kind
of
entertainment
is
permissible
or
what
it
looks
like
to
honor
the
Sabbath
Day
outside
of
corporate
worship
.



When
conscience
pricks

Of
note
,
the
strongest
commands
of
conscience
are
often
negative
,
in
terms
of
what
you
are
not
permitted
to
do
,
rather
than
what
you
may
or
must
do
.


For
example
,
if
you
use
foul
language
,
your
conscience
will
likely
bother
you
more
than
if
you
fail
to
correct
someone
else
using
such
language
.


Or
,
if
a
publisher
prints
pro-abortion
pamphlets
that
he
objects
to
,
his
conscience
will
make
him
feel
guilty
more
than
if
he
fails
to
promote
life
as
he
believes
he
ought
.



When
the
conscience
commands
a
person
not
to
do
something
,
the
command
is
about
a
very
specific
action
.


Alternatively
,
if
the
command
is
instead
to
act
on
something
good
,
there
are
often
various
ways
of
pursuing
that
good
.



Conscience
and
the
Church

Because
of
sin
,
no
person’s
conscience
is
perfectly
aligned
with
what
God
commands
in
His
Word
.


The
chart
below
is
based
on
one
from
a
helpful
book
titled
Conscience
:
What
It
Is
,
How
To
Train
It
,
and
Loving
Those
Who
Differ
,
by
Andrew
Naselli
and
J
.

D
.


Crowley
.


The
authors
used
it
to
explain
the
difference
between
two
people’s
consciences
,
and
how
they
compare
to
God’s
will
.


The
letters
within
the
chart
refer
to
different
rules
or
principles
of
right
and
wrong
.



Both
Arnold
and
Zoey
have
added
rules
to
their
conscience
that
are
not
commanded
in
Scripture
.


For
example
,
perhaps
Arnold
has
a
history
of
alcohol
abuse
in
his
family
,
so
he
adds
letter
‘C’
which
commands
him
---------------
Arnold’s
belief
that
he
must
not
play
cards
or
any
games
involving
dice
.


Arnold
and
Zoey
have
also
both
failed
to
include
letter
‘B’
in
their
conscience
.


Perhaps
this
is
a
failure
to
consistently
honor
the
Sabbath
Day
,
and
their
consciences
no
longer
accuse
them
for
it
.


However
,
Arnold
and
Zoey’s
consciences
are
both
aligned
with
God’s
will
in
letters
‘J’
through
‘M
,’
where
they
have
rightly
applied
biblical
principles
and
commands
to
their
lives
and
consciences
.


The
natural
tendency
is
to
think
that
if
another
person
has
more
rules
than
us
,
they
are
legalistic
.


Alternatively
,
if
they
have
fewer
rules
,
they
are
failing
to
live
as
Christians
.


However
,
Scripture
remains
the
standard
to
which
we
must
seek
to
align
our
conscience
.




[
]

The
conscience
can
easily
become
oversensitive
by
including
rules
that
are
not
matters
of
right
and
wrong
.


We
see
examples
of
the
Pharisees
in
the
New
Testament
who
created
additional
rules
for
the
Sabbath
and
---------------
we
do
not
abide
by
similar
rules
on
the
Sabbath
.



Alternatively
,
conscience
can
become
desensitized
.


Perhaps
you
use
or
tolerate
foul
language
that
would
have
shocked
you
a
decade
ago
,
or
you
consume
entertainment
that
you
would
have
been
ashamed
of
years
earlier
.


Our
conscience
does
not
always
accurately
tell
us
what
is
sin
and
what
is
not
.


While
it
might
not
always
make
sense
to
follow
conscience
in
relation
to
other
authorities
,
we
have
a
duty
to
obey
it
because
we
cannot
commit
what
we
believe
is
sin
.



At
the
same
time
,
we
should
be
careful
when
dealing
with
the
consciences
of
other
people
.


In
1
Corinthians
8
,
the
Apostle
Paul
talks
about
whether
believers
can
eat
meat
offered
to
idols
and
refers
to
consideration
for
brothers
and
sisters
with
a
weaker
conscience
.


So
,
if
we
believe
a
brother
or
sister
has
a
weaker
conscience
,
we
must
not
be
a
stumbling
block
to
them
and
cause
them
to
disobey
their
conscience
.


On
disputable
issues
,
we
may
realize
that
someone
has
a
weaker
conscience
,
and
we
can
discuss
the
biblical
principles
that
apply
.


Or
perhaps
they
have
a
stronger
conscience
,
and
they
can
help
us
understand
where
our
conscience
is
not
aligned
to
Scripture
.



Again
,
conscience
is
not
meant
to
be
some
wishy-washy
idea
where
everyone
can
believe
what
they
want
,
like
in
the
time
of
the
judges
of
Israel
,
when
“everyone
did
what
was
right
in
his
own
eyes
.

”
There
are
---------------
authorities
versus
our
callings
to
obey
what
God
demands
of
us
?


What
about
masking
,
vaccines
,
etc
.


,
both
within
the
public
square
and
the
Church
?


Christian
conscience
differs
on
these
issues
,
and
believers
can
have
biblical
arguments
for
why
they
think
God
commands
or
prohibits
different
actions
.



What
isn’t
conscience
?



Some
of
us
might
react
to
the
idea
that
conscience
is
a
kind
of
subjective
belief
that
is
not
accountable
to
other
people
.


We
can’t
simply
say
,
“well
,
what’s
right
for
you
isn’t
necessarily
right
for
me
.

”
Conscience
is
not
merely
a
personal
preference
like
your
favorite
food
or
music
.


It
is
also
not
license
to
do
whatever
you
please
and
ignore
other
authorities
.


Rather
,
freedom
of
conscience
refers
to
moral
beliefs
that
respect
a
limited
sphere
of
individual
authority
while
still
recognizing
other
legitimate
authorities
that
can
impose
obligations
on
us
.



As
such
,
the
conscience
is
not
unlimited
.


Some
people
might
abuse
the
ability
to
claim
conscientious
objection
out
of
self-interest
or
to
simply
justify
their
actions
.


Authorities
such
as
the
civil
government
,
---------------

However
,
if
the
civil
government
(or
other
authorities
)
limits
conscience
,
they
must
provide
good
justification
for
doing
so
and
seek
to
accommodate
conscientious
objectors
as
much
as
they
are
able
,
such
as
through
exemptions
for
freedom
of
conscience
.


Abraham
Kuyper
again
shows
the
importance
of
conscience
,
stating
that
:

“Ten
times
better
is
a
state
in
which
a
few
eccentrics
can
make
themselves
a
laughingstock
for
a
time
by
abusing
freedom
of
conscience
,
than
a
state
in
which
these
eccentricities
are
prevented
by
violating
conscience
itself
.

”

Conclusion

Ultimately
,
conscience
belongs
to
an
individual
and
is
accountable
to
God
.


However
,
it
should
also
be
rooted
in
Biblical
commands
and
principles
.


Increasingly
,
we
encounter
disagreements
in
the
Church
about
various
issues
,
while
in
the
public
square
some
Christians’
jobs
are
threatened
because
the
State
fails
to
recognize
conscience
.


On
many
matters
,
Christians
will
refuse
to
do
something
they
believe
is
evil
even
if
others
do
not
believe
the
action
is
wrong
.


The
Church
has
an
---------------
according
to
moral
standards
based
on
the
will
and
Sovereignty
of
God
.


Wherever
we
find
ourselves
,
let’s
seek
to
say
,
“I
myself
always
strive
to
have
a
conscience
without
offense
toward
God
and
men”
(Acts
24
:16
)
.

Human

Should

In

years
there’s
been
a
worrying
downward
trend
for
religious

to

consciences

Stand
up

I
know
of
Christians
who
can

And
I

(see

This
is
a
legitimate
discussion
to
have

bigger
question
is
:

If

does

By
“intellectual
conscience
,”
Nietzsche
means
the
idea
that
it
is
wrong
to
believe
something
unless
you
have
good
reason
to
think
that
the
belief
is
true
.


Someone
with
an
intellectual
conscience
will
form
and
endorse
beliefs
by
applying
the
best
epistemic
standards
known
to
him
or
her
.



Most
of
us
,
Nietzsche
thinks
,
lack
an
intellectual
conscience
:


[T

great
majority
of

I

:
the

it

to

How
does
the
conscious
differ
from
the
conscience
?


Being
conscious
is
the
state
of
being
awake
and
alert
.


Conscience
,
on
the
other
hand
,
refers
to
an
awareness
of
whether
actions
are
right
or
wrong
.



---------------
At
a
Glance

While
the
two
terms
are
often
confused
,
the
conscious
and
the
conscience
refer
to
very
different
things
.


Your
conscious
allows
you
to
be
aware
of
your
place
in
the
world
,
while
your
conscience
allows
you
to
behave
in
this
world
in
morally
and
socially
acceptable
ways
.


As
described
below
,
being
conscious
refers
to
your
awareness
of
yourself
and
the
world
around
you
.


Your
conscience
is
your
ability
to
distinguish
between
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
.




What
Does
Conscience
Mean
?




Your
conscience
is
the
part
of
your
personality
that
helps
you
determine
right
and
wrong
and
keeps
you
from
acting
upon
your
most
basic
urges
and
desires
.



Your
conscience
is
what
makes
you
feel
guilty
when
you
do
something
bad
and
good
when
you
do
something
kind
.



---------------
even
altruistic
ways
.



In
Freudian
theory
,
the
conscience
is
part
of
the
superego
that
contains
information
about
what
is
viewed
as
bad
or
negative
by
your
parents
and
by
society—all
the
values
you
learned
and
absorbed
during
your
upbringing
.


The
conscience
emerges
over
time
as
you
take
in
information
about
what
is
considered
right
and
wrong
by
your
caregivers
,
your
peers
,
and
the
culture
in
which
you
live
.


---------------
caregiver
'
s
rules
.


For
example
,
if
a
parent
sets
a
rule
,
a
child
could
learn
a
sense
of
right
and
wrong
regarding
that
topic
.


Studies
have
also
examined
other
factors
that
may
affect
the
way
conscience
develops
,
including
the
nature
of
the
parent-child
relationship
,
style
of
parental
discipline
,
and
the
child
'
s
temperament—but
more
research
is
needed
.

Breaking
Down
the
Differences


Conscience

-
Noun
---------------

To
further
explain
their
differences
,
here
are
examples
of
how
the
terms
conscience
and
conscious
could
be
used
in
a
sentence
.




Conscience


They
had
a
guilty
conscience
because
they
cheated
on
the
test
.



The
term
conscience
here
describes
this
person
'
s
sense
of
what
is
right
and
wrong
and
the
subsequent
feeling
of
guilt
they
have
over
cheating
on
the
test
.


---------------

When
thinking
about
these
two
concepts
,
just
remember
that
conscious
means
to
be
awake
and
aware
while
conscience
refers
to
your
inner
sense
of
right
and
wrong
.

The

After

Nietzsche’s

consideration
,
however
,
has
been
devoted
to
what
was
believed
to
link
the
psychological
to
the
metaethical
:
the
mental
habit
or
act
of
conscience
(and
its
sister-concept
of
synderesis
)
,
though
interest
in
the
subject
has
recently
seen
a
modest
resurgence
(e

,

and

)
.



What
is
the
scope
and
nature
of
this
apparent
ability
to
intuitively
grasp
right
from
wrong
?


Can
conscience
err
and
,
if
so
,
do
its
dictates
still
bind
?


The
best
way
to
address
these
and
other
questions
is
to
employ
a
developmental
approach
.


The
term
conscience
is
still
generally
used
to
refer
to
an
innate
moral
sense
,
but
it
has
slightly
different
connotations
today
than
it
did
in
the
medieval
period
,
which
in
turn
had
different
connotations
from
what
preceded
it
in
pagan
antiquity
and
in
Scripture
.


Still
,
medieval
theories
of
conscience
drew
extensively
on
these
earlier
sources
.


Since
the
concepts
of
conscience
and
synderesis
evolved
over
time
,
then
,
it
will
be
necessary
to
take
a
linear
approach
to
the
topic
and
begin
with
some

1
The
Ancient
Context
:
Judicial
Conscience

To
understand
the
medieval
theory
of
conscience
,
it
is
essential
to
examine
its
etymology
.


Unlike
most
philosophical
categories
that
are
central
to
medieval
thought
,
the
concept
of
conscience
did
not
have
its
origins
in
Plato
or
Aristotle
(Potts
1982
:
687
)
.


Rather
,
most
scholars
agree
,
it
originated
in
the
Greek
playwrights
of
the
fifth
century
BCE
---------------
1961
:
5
)
.



The
English
word
“conscience”
is
derived
from
the
Latin
conscientia
.


Its
Greek
equivalent
is
syneidesis
.


Both
terms
connote
a
state
or
act
of
“sharing
knowledge
with
oneself”
(Sorabji
2014
:
12
)
.


This
knowledge
is
---------------
objects
in
the
outside
world
but
can
also
“turn
back
on”
(reflectere
)
or
become
an
object
to
themselves
.

put
it
in

study
of
the
concept

in
the
Western
tradition
:

---------------

also
Sorabji
2014
:

)

Lewis
refers
to
this
primarily
pagan
understanding
of
conscience
as
an
“inner
witness”
.


It
does
not
judge
our
actions
as
right
or
wrong
,
but
merely
testifies
to
their
existence
:
---------------

some
other
way
.


(Lewis
1960
:
190
)

Others
,
however
,
regard
the
sort
of
conscience
that
Lewis
describes
here
as
a
type
of
internal
judge
,
and
therefore
refer
to
it
as
“judicial
conscience”
(D’Arcy
1961
:
8
)
.


While
this
property
of
the
mind
does
not
necessarily
issue
binding
rules
,
it
does
pass
moral
judgements
on
our
deeds
.


It
would
,
however
,
eventually
take
on
the
role
of
issuing
moral
dictates
for
future
acts
as
well
.


Eric
D’Arcy
refers
to
this
later
form
of
syneidesis
or
conscientia
as
the
“legislative
conscience”
whose
innovator
,
he
argues
,
was
the
Apostle
Paul
(ca
.


5
CE–ca
.


64/67
CE
)
,
the
most
important
founder
of
the
Christian
faith
after
Jesus
of
Nazareth

(D’Arcy
1961
:
8
)
.



1

2
St
.


Paul
:
Legislative
Conscience

The
judicial
understanding
of
conscience
continued
well
into
the
first
century
of
the
Common
Era
.


To
be
sure
,
Paul
himself
continued
to
employ
it
.


At
the
same
time
,
D’Arcy
credited
Paul
with
introducing
,
in
addition
to
the
“judicial
conscience”
,
a
novel
conception
he
termed
the
“legislative
conscience”
.


It
is
not
difficult
to
see
why
the
earlier
judicial
conception
would
later
take
on
legislative
features
.


This
is
because
the
ability
to
judge
past
actions
as
either
right
or
wrong—and
---------------

by
the
law
,
they
are
a
law
for
themselves
,
even
though
they
do
not

have
the
law
.


They
show
that
the
requirements
of
the
law
are
written

on
their
hearts
,
their
consciences
also
bearing
witness
,
and
their

thoughts
sometimes
accusing
them
and
at
other
times
even
defending

them
.


(Romans
2
:14–15
;
NIV
)
---------------
latter
was
later
glossed
as
a
reference
to
the
natural
law
,
which
is
accessible
to
all
people
,
non-Jews
included
,
and
is
consistent
with
the
Mosaic
Law
.


Notice
that
,
according
to
the
foregoing
passage
,
conscience

(syneidesis
)
is
not
the
ultimate
source
of
right
and
wrong
.


Rather
,
the
foundation
of
right
and
wrong
is
the
objective
moral
law
,
which
is
both
“written
on
[men’s
]
hearts”
and
borne
witness
to
by
conscience
.



One
might
say
,
then
,
that
the
objective
norm
of
morality
on
Paul’s
account
is
the
moral
law
(or
natural
law
)
.


Conscience
,
however
,
might
be
termed
morality’s
subjective
norm
.


This
is
made
clear
in
another
passage
from
St
.


Paul
,
where
he
is
addressing
the
question
of
whether
it
is
---------------
since
“food
does
not
bring
us
near
to
God—we
are
no
worse
if
we
do
not
eat
,
and
no
better
if
we
do”
(1
Corinthians
8
:8
;
NIV
)
.


Still
,
even
though
the
consciences
of
such
Christians
are
erroneous
,
they
must
follow
them
since
conscience
,
Paul
suggests
,
is
a
rule
of
conduct

(Romans
14
:13–23
)
.


Eric
D’Arcy
sums
up
these
two
important
contributions
of
St
.


Paul
as
follows
:


St
.


Paul
,
then
,
introduces
an
entirely
new
phase
in
the
history
of
the

term
“conscience”
in
moral
theory
,
and
two
new
features
characterize

his
use
of
it
.


First
,
it
is
to
play
a
directive
role
before
action

takes
place
.


In
the
pagan
writers
,
conscience
did
not
appear
on
the

scene
until
after
the
action
was
performed
,
and
its
role
was
purely

judicial
;
but
in
St
.


Paul
,
conscience
is
credited
with
a
legislative

function
,
and
it
induces
an
obligation
in
the
proper
sense
.


Second
,

conscience
is
fallible
:
the
directions
it
issues
may
be
mistaken
;
but

whether
it
be
mistaken
or
not
,
it
seems
that
we
are
bound
to
follow

its
rulings
.


(D’Arcy
1961
:
11–12
)

In
sum
,
we
might
follow
Sorabji’s
suggestion
that
this
phase
in
the
development
of
the
concept
of
conscience—that
is
,
from
its
origins
in
fifth-century
BCE
Greek
literature
to
the
first-century
CE—has
eight
features
(Sorabji
2014
:
36
)
.

St

Jerome
:
The
Invention
of
Synderesis

That
conscience
was
so
central
a
concept
in
St
.


Paul’s
writings
guaranteed
it
an
important
place
in
the
moral
theology
of
the
Greek
and
Latin
Fathers
,
especially
St
.


Basil
,
John
Damascene
and
St
.


Ambrose

---------------
and
the
ox’s
face
the
appetitive
part
(cf
.


Plato
,
Republic
,
436b–441b
)
.


What
did
the
eagle
represent
?


According
to
Jerome
,
it
represented
that
“spark
of
conscience”
(scintilla
conscientiae
)
which
makes
us
aware
of
our
sinfulness
when
reason
,
spirit
or
desire
become
disordered
.


Medieval
manuscripts
refer
to
this
psychological
property
as
synderesis
(or
---------------

Now
above
these
three
was
the
eagle
;
so
in
the
soul
,
they
say
,
above

the
other
three
elements
and
beyond
them
is
a
fourth
,
which
the
Greeks

call
synderesis
.


This
is
that
spark
of
conscience
which
was
not

quenched
even
in
the
heart
of
Cain
,
when
he
was
driven
out
of

paradise
.


This
it
is
that
which

It
is
natural
to
identify
synderesis
with
the
eagle

since
it
is
distinct
from

three
elements
and
corrects
them

when
they
err

However
,
we
also
see
that
this
conscience

(conscientia

is
cast
down
in
some
people
,
who
have
neither
shame
nor

insight
regarding
their
offences
,
and
loses
its

(commentary

however
,
he
does
admit
the
existence
of
those
who
are
shameless
and
lacking
in
moral
insight
.


Such
people
are
oblivious
to
their
offenses
because
,
according
to
Jerome
,
their
conscience
(conscientia
)
ceases
to
be
present
in
them
(“looses

place”
)
.


If
synderesis
cannot
be
lost
,
but
conscience
can
,
then
it
seems
to
follow
that
they
are
separate
properties
of
the
soul
.


In
any
case

Jerome’s
intention

was

The
Scholastic
Origins
of
the
Debate

Peter
Lombard’s
role
in
the
evolution
of
the
concept
of
conscience
is
both
surprising
and
unsurprising
.


It
is—at
first
sight
,
anyway—surprising
because
Lombard
does
not
discuss
conscience
or
synderesis
in
any
actual
detail
.


Indeed
,
he
does
not
,
strictly
speaking
,
mention
the
terms
“synderesis”
or
“conscience”
at
all
.


What
he
does
is
merely
to
allude
to
Jerome’s
commentary
on
Ezekiel
in
the
context
of
discussing
the
will’s
role
in
how
rational
agents
can
naturally
want
---------------

Lombard’s
brief
mention
of
Jerome’s
“spark
of
reason”
(sic
)
in
the
aforementioned
passage
is
the
full
extent
of
his
treatment
of
conscience
and
synderesis
.


Still
,
that
was
sufficient
to
ensure
that
it
would
receive
robust
attention
by
later
scholastics
,
who
would
track
down
the

turned
to
Jerome’s
text
in
order
to
scrutinize
the
original
passage
.


There
,
they
discovered
his
apparent
distinction
between
synderesis
and
conscience
,
which
in
turn
would
come
to
frame
the
parameters
of
the
later
medieval
debate
.


If
synderesis
and
conscience
are
in
fact
two
separate
parts
of
the
soul
,
for
instance
,
what
is
their
relationship
to
one
another
?


What
,
come
to
that
,
are
their
respective
natures

Stephen
Langton
(1155–1228
)
,
regent
master
of
theology
at
Paris
and
later
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
is
important
in
the
present
context
less
for
any
systematic
treatment
of
conscience—indeed
Stephen
scarcely
touches
on
the
issue
at
all—than
for
his
somewhat
scattered
views
on
synderesis
.


The
relevant
treatment
comes
in
Stephen’s
Quaestiones

.


D’Arcy
sums
up
Langton’s
position
as
follows
:


Remorse
of
conscience
is
the
work
,
not
of
synderesis
,
but
of
reason
,

for
synderesis
remains
at
the
level
of
general
principles
,
whereas

reason
descends
to
the
concrete
case
;
but
it
is
precisely
over
the

concrete
case
that
remorse
of
conscience
is
felt
;
hence
it
is
by

reason
,
and
not
by
synderesis
,
that
we
sin
.

Philip
the
Chancellor
:
The
First
Systematic
Treatment
of
Synderesis
and
Conscience

Although
Stephen
Langton
was
the
first
scholastic
to
touch
on
the
issue
of
synderesis
in
any
depth
,
it
was
Philip
the
Chancellor
(ca
.


1170–1237
)
who
wrote
the
first
treatise
devoted
to
exploring
the
relationship
between
synderesis
and
conscience
(Lottin
1948
:
139–157
)
.


As
chancellor
of
Notre
Dame
,
Philip
had
the
right
to
grant
the
license
to
teach
in
the
theology
faculty
at
Paris
,
and
it
was
under
his
tenure
that
the
---------------
for
the
former
,
and
one
for
the
latter
.


Although
primarily
an
administrator
,
Philip
was
also
a
trained
theologian
.


His
most
important
work
is
the
Summa
de
bono
,
which
includes
the
treatise
on
conscience
.



In
his
treatise
Philip
sets
out
to
answer
several
questions
related
to
---------------
who
apparently
share
the
view
that
synderesis
is
a
faculty
of
the
soul
independent
of
the
others
(Philip
the
Chancellor
,
Summa
de
bono
:
Treatise
on
Conscience
;
Potts
trans
.


1980
:
95–96
)
.



Against
the
claim
that
synderesis
is
a
power
of
the
soul
,
Philip
---------------

is
a
disposition
arising
naturally
in
conjunction
with
that

potentiality
by
which
the
natural
will
is
directed
to
what
is
good

without
qualification
.


(Summa
de
bono
:
Treatise
on
Conscience
;
Potts

trans
.


1980
:
96
)

---------------

potentiality
or
a
disposition
,
the
right
answer
lies
in
taking

something
in
between
:
a
dispositional
potentiality
.


(Summa
de
bono
:

Treatise
on
Conscience
;
Potts
trans
.


1980
:
97
)

It
would
seem
,
then
,
that
synderesis
is
a
potentiality
,
albeit
an
---------------
Philip
puts
it
,
synderesis
is
that
which
“murmurs
back
against
sin
and
correctly
contemplates
and
wants
what
is
good
without
qualification”

(Summa
de
bono
:
Treatise
on
Conscience
;
Potts
trans
.


1980
:
100
)
.



On
the
matter
of
conscience
and
how
it
is
related
to
synderesis
,
Philip
distinguishes
them
.


For
one
thing
,
conscience
can
be
mistaken
while
synderesis
cannot
.


Specifically
,
conscience
is
the
result
of
a
concurrence
of
synderesis
with
free
decision
(liberum
arbitrium
)
.


Put
otherwise
,
it
is
the
specific
application
of
a
general
moral
principle
that
is
the
outcome
of
deliberation
.


When
correctly
applied
,
conscience
is
correct
.


When
incorrectly
applied
,
it
errs
.


In
either
case
,
the
judgement
of
conscience
generates
a
moral
obligation
to
act
.


Philip
uses
the
following
example
of
how
synderesis
,
which
is
always
right
,
can
nonetheless
conjoin
with
an
erring
conscience
(Potts
1980
:
104
)
:

.


Unerring

premise

synderesis

.

.


Erring
judgement
of
conscience
:
“Therefore
this
Christ
fellow
should

be

to

From
the
foregoing
example
,
it
is
clear
that
synderesis
delivers
a
general
,
non-deliberative
proposition
,
while
conscience
yields
what
Potts
calls
a
particular
,
“deontic
proposition”

St

Bonaventure
:
Conscience
as
Cognitive/Synderesis
as
Affective

One
of
the
most
prominent
representatives
of
the
Franciscan
intellectual
---------------
faculty
,
a
position
he
held
until
1257
.


His
commentary
on
the
Sentences
is
the
fruit
of
these
lectures
,
and
it
is
in
this
work
that
he
discusses
the
topics
of
conscience
and
synderesis
.


For
Bonaventure
we
not
only
possess
innate
moral
knowledge
,
but
we
also
have
an
inextinguishable
inclination
towards
achieving
the
good
.


Our
inborn
knowledge
of
the
former
,
that
is
,
of
the
natural
law
,
is
associated
with
conscience
,
which
resides
in
the
intellect
,
while
our
inclination
towards
desiring
the
good
is
associated
with
synderesis
,
which
inheres
in
the
will
.



What
is
the
ontological
status
of
conscience
?


According
to
Bonaventure
,
just
as
theologians
have
disagreed
over
the
nature
of
“thought”
,
defining
it
variously
as
the
power
of
thinking
,
a
habit
or
an
apprehended
principle
of
knowledge
,
so
too
have
they
differed
over
how
to
define
“conscience”
(conscientia
)
.


Most
commonly
,
however
,
the
term
has
been
used
to
refer
to
a
cognitive
habit
or
disposition
that
relates
to
the
practical
as
opposed
to
the
theoretical
intellect
.


Indeed
,
it
is
---------------


theoretical
knowledge
perfects
our
thought
to
the
extent
that
the

latter
is
theoretical
,
whereas
conscience
is
a
disposition
perfecting

our
thought
to
the
extent
that
it
is
practical
,
or
to
the
extent
that

it
directs
us
towards
deeds
.


(Bonaventure

Is
such
a
disposition
innate
or
acquired
?


It
is
possible
,
according
to
Bonaventure
,
to
find
authorities
on
both
sides
of
the
debate
.


For
the
opinion
that
conscience
is
innate
,
Bonaventure
cites
,
among
other
authorities
,
St

famous
reference
to
a
moral
law
that
is
“written
on
[men’s
]
hearts”
in
Romans

:14–15
.


He
also
appeals
to
a
“natural
instinct
to
seek
blessedness
and
[to
]
honor
[one’s
]
parents”
(commentary

.


For
the
opinion
that
conscience
is
not
innate
,
on
the
other
hand
,
Bonaventure
cites
Aristotle’s
claim
that
the
soul
is
a
blank
slate
.


Bonaventure’s
solution
is
to
find
a
middle
position
between
St
.


Paul
,
on
the
one
hand
,
and
Aristotle
,
on
the
other
.


His
conclusion
:
conscience
is
part
innate
,
part
acquired
.



---------------
principles
of
practical
reason
.


This
innate
capacity
to
immediately
grasp
such
principles
as
true
or
not
in
the
realm
of
practical
reason
is
called
conscience
.


It
is
associated
,
for
Bonaventure
,
with
the
Augustinian
“natural
light”—or
“natural
tribunal”—that
is
built
into
the
structure
of
the
mind

which
permits
rational
agents

and
“Do
not

In
what
sense
,
though
,
is
conscience
acquired
?


Although
the
ability
to
judge
the
deontic
propositions
of
the
natural
law
as
self-evidently
true
is
innate
,
it
does
not
follow
that
the

such
propositions
are

Conscience
,
then
,
is

innate

partly
acquired

respect
to
the
content
of
the
natural

But
what
is
the
relationship
of
such
universal
premises
to
the
conclusions
of
practical
reason
?

Note
that

of
an
erroneous

(Bonaventure
argues
that
male
circumcision
and
the
prohibition
on

no

Is
one
obliged

It
depends
,
since
conscience
is
fallible

If

then
one

If

what
it
dictates
is
contrary
to
the
divine
will—as
is
sometimes
the
case
when
applying
basic
deontological
principles

then
conscience
does

Rather

the

If

he

Yes

the

Indeed
synderesis

for
Bonaventure

is
precisely
the
counterpart

In

this
disposition
takes
the
form
of
the
“natural

that

synderesis

St
Thomas
Aquinas
:
Synderesis
and
Conscience
as
Cognitive

Thomas
Aquinas
(1224/25–1274
)
is
,
by
any
measure
,
one
of
the
most
important
,
if
not
the
most
important
,
scholastic
theologian
of
the
later
Middle
Ages
.


Although
his
views
on
conscience
and
synderesis
have
received
less
attention
in
recent
years
than
his
theory
of
natural
law
,
this
is
unjustified
.


For
the
scholastics
,
a
full
account
of
morality
---------------
knowledge
of
right
and
wrong
.



Aquinas
discussed
the
issues
of
synderesis
and
conscience
in
several
of
his
major
works
,
from
his
early
commentary
on
the
Sentences
and
the
De
veritate
to
his
mature
Summa
theologica
(see
D’Arcy
1961
:
36–47
)
.


As
---------------
“habit-like
faculty”
.


Aquinas
,
as
might
be
expected
,
hews
much
closer
to
his
Dominican
mentor
and
teacher
Albert
the
Great
(ca
.


1200–1280
)
for
whom
both
synderesis
and
conscience
belong
to
the
intellect
(see
Dougherty
2018
:
221
)
.



---------------
object
of
the
practical
intellect
is
the
good
“under
the
aspect
of
truth”

.


Synderesis
and
conscience
,
for
Aquinas
,
both
belong
to
the
practical
intellect
.



---------------
Like
speculative
reasoning
,
practical
reasoning
generally
takes
a
deductive
form
.


Just
as
science
is
the
conclusion
of
the
demonstrative
syllogism
,
so
conscience
is
the
conclusion
of
a
practical
syllogism
.


The
practical
syllogism
,
like
the
demonstrative
syllogism
,
contains
a
major
premise
,
a
minor
premise
and
a
conclusion
.


The
major
premise
is
drawn
or
---------------
and
minor
premises
,
a
conclusion
is
drawn
that
generates
a
moral
obligation
to
act
(Hoffmann
2012
:
258
)
.


This
inferential
judgment
is
associated
,
for
Aquinas
,
with
conscience
:
an
act—as
opposed
to
a
faculty
or
a
habit—that
includes
a
number
of
applications
,
such
as
“to
witness
,
to
bind
,
or
incite
,
and
also
to
accuse
,
torment
,
or
rebuke”
(Thomas
Aquinas
,
Summa
theologica
I
,
q
.


79
,
a
.


13
,
corp
.


)
.



Conscience
acts
as
a
“witness”
when
it
is
consciously
aware
of
some
personal
wrongdoing
,
whether
of
commission
or
omission
.


It
“binds”
or
“incites”
when
it
makes
a
judgement
that
some
act
should
be
performed
.


Finally
,
it
“accuses”
,
“torments”
or
“rebukes”
when
it
judges
that
some
past
action
was
either
morally
acceptable
or
it
was
not
.


Although
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
conscience
in
the
first
sense—conscience
as
witness—can
function
as
an
application
of
knowledge
to
conduct
,
this
seems
less
problematic
in
the
second
and
third
senses
of
the
term
,
which
harken
back
to
the
legislative
and
judicial
senses
of
conscience
found
in
St
.


Paul
and
pagan
antiquity
,
respectively
(D’Arcy
1961
:
46
)
.


In
any
case
,
an
example
of
the
way
in
which
conscience
applies
the
natural
law—whose
principles
are
apprehended
by
synderesis—
is
articulated
in
Aquinas’s
De
veritate
:
---------------

higher
reason
presents
this
minor
premise
“sexual
intercourse
with

this
woman
is
forbidden
by
the
law
of
God”
,
the
application
of

conscience
will
be
made
by
concluding
:
“this
sexual
intercourse
is
to

be
avoided”
.


(De
veritate
,
q
.


17
,
a
.


2
,
corp
.


;
cited
in
Dougherty

2018
:
222
)

Now
the
dictates
of
conscience
can
either
be
right
,
if
correctly
deduced
from
the
natural
law
,
or
wrong
,
if
they
are
incorrectly
deduced
.


The
dictates
of
the
former
are
the
product
of
a
“correct
conscience”
and
the
judgements
of
the
latter
are
the
result
of
an
“erroneous
conscience”
.


Since
synderesis
is
infallible
,
the
main
source
of
an
erroneous
conscience
,
when
it
does
occur
,
is
the
agent’s
adoption
of
a
faulty
minor
premise
in
the
practical
syllogism
(De
veritate
q
.


17
,
a
.


2
;
Potts
trans
.


1980
:
132–133
)
.



Now
it
is
clear
that
we
have
an
obligation
to
follow
a
correct
conscience
since
to
do
so
contributes
to
achieving
our
final
end
.


But
what
of
an
erroneous
conscience
?


Does
this
have
any
authority
?


For
Aquinas
,
an
erring
conscience
also
binds
.


It
does
not
,
however
,
necessarily
excuse
.


As
Hoffmann
puts
it
,


regardless
of
whether
my
action
is
objectively
good
,
evil
or

indifferent
,
conscience
binds
,
for
it
is
by
means
of
conscience
that

an
action
is
proposed
to
me
as
good
,
bad
,
or
indifferent
.


(Hoffmann

2012
:
260
)
---------------
refrains
.


According
to
Aquinas
,
this
agent
,
although
he
does
what
is
objectively
right
,
nonetheless
sins
.


Why
?


Because
in
choosing
the
opposite
of
what
his
conscience
dictated
,
he
chose
to
do
something
he
believed
to
be
evil
.


And
choosing
what
is
(subjectively
if
not
objectively
)
wrong
,
for
Aquinas
,
is
a
sin
:
“
[F
]
from
the
very
fact
that
---------------
thereto
becomes
evil”
(Summa
theologica
,
I-II
,
q
.


19
,
a
.


5
,
corp
.


)
.



What
follows
from
this
is
that
conscience
,
whether
right
or
erroneous
,
always
binds
.


As
to
the
question
of
whether
an
erroneous
conscience
excuses
,
on
the
other
hand
,
that
depends
on
the
type
of
ignorance
that
causes
it
.


This
is
because
some
types
of
ignorance
render
an
act
---------------

theologica
I-II
,
q
.


19
,
a
.


6
,
corp
.


)

Ignorance
that
contributes
to
an
erroneous
conscience
that
is
in
any
way
voluntary
is
vincible
,
or
able
to
be
corrected
,
and
therefore
culpable
if
followed
.


This
generally
happens
where
the
agent’s
ignorance
of
the
---------------
Unfortunately
,
as
we
have
seen
,
such
precepts
are
of
a
very
general
character
,
such
as
“do
good
and
avoid
evil”
.


For
such
general
knowledge
to
be
applicable
by
conscience
,
it
must
be
further
specified
.


This
further
specification
comprises
the
secondary
precepts
of
the
natural
law
,
which
are
closely
drawn
from
the
former
precepts
and
from
natural
---------------

A
final
problem
seems
to
emerge
:
are
we
not
,
according
to
Aquinas’s
account
of
the
erroneous
conscience
,
left
with
the
possibility
of
a
moral
dilemma
?


For
if
we
have
an
obligation
to
always
follow
our
consciences
,
but
we
sometimes
sin
when
we
do
follow
them
,
then
it
seems
that
we
are
sometimes
put
into
a
double
bind
.


We
seem
,
that
is
,
to
sometimes
have
conflicting
obligations
so
that
regardless
of
what
we
do
,
we
sin
.


Aquinas’s
solution
is
that
it
is
only
wrong
to
follow
a
conscience
that
is
in
a
state
of
vincible
ignorance
.


Since
such
ignorance
is
by
definition
correctable
,
we
can
always
resolve
the
apparent
dilemma
by
choosing
to
put
aside
our
ignorance
.


As
far
as
acting
from
invincible
ignorance
is
concerned
,
we
are
pardoned
.

William
of
Ockham
:
New
Directions
in
the
Understanding
of
Synderesis
and
Conscience

With
the
fourteenth-century
theologian
William
of
Ockham
(1285–1347
)
we
encounter
some
radically
new
developments
on
the
topics
of
synderesis
and
conscience
.


While
Ockham’s
Franciscan
predecessor
John
Duns
Scotus
had
disagreements
with
Aquinas
about
the
nature
of
the
moral
law
,
Scotus
fundamentally
agreed
with
the
Dominican
in
viewing
synderesis
and
conscience
a
habit
and
an
act
of
the
practical
reason
,
respectively
,
whose
jobs
were
to
apprehend
the
basic
principles
of
morality
in
the
case
of
synderesis
,
and
to
apply
them
in
the
case
of
conscience
(John
Duns
Scotus
,
Ordinatio
2
,
d
.


39
;
Wolter
trans
.


1997
:
162–163
)
.


Like
Scotus
,
Ockham
also
agrees
with
Aquinas
in
several
crucial
respects
.


---------------
tradition
which
preceded
him
,
however
,
is
in
his
abandonment
of
the
concept
of
synderesis
,
and
in
his
unique
approach
to
the
invincibly
erroneous
conscience
.



It
is
difficult
to
know
for
certain
why
Ockham
abandoned
the
concept
of
---------------
moral
epistemology
was
Pinckaers’
assumption
that
,
because
Ockham
discarded
the
traditional
notion
of
synderesis
,
he
must
have
done
the
same
for
its
twin
concept
of
conscience
.


Pinckaers
conceded
that
moral
principles
,
even
if
rooted
in
the
divine
will
,
still
need
to
be
applied
to
particular
situations
on
Ockham’s
account
.


This
role
was
,
of
course
,
reserved
for
conscience
in
the
earlier
tradition
.


In
Ockham
,
according
to
Pinckaers
,
this
role
now
became
associated
with
practical
reason
and
prudence
(Pinckaers
1993
:
259
)
.



A
closer
reading
of
the
textual
evidence
suggests
that
Ockham
very
much
made
use
of
the
traditional
concept
of
conscience
.


Indeed
,
much
of
how
he
employed
the
concept
was
consistent
with
the
tradition
,
especially
as
articulated
by
Aquinas
.


Ockham
associates
the
dictates
of
practical
reason
,
for
example
,
with
judgements
of
conscience
.


He
is
also
emphatic
in
his
belief
that
rational
agents
have
an
absolute
obligation
to
follow
their
consciences
,
which
can
be
correct
or
erroneous
(Quaestiones
variae
,
q
.


8
,
a
.


1
,
OTh
8
:
411
)
.


A
conscience
is
correct
when
it
is
in
accord
with
right
reason
;
it
is
erroneous
when
it
is
not
.


Finally
,
an
erroneous
conscience
,
for
Ockham
,
as
with
Aquinas
,
is
either
in
a
state
of
vincible—voluntary
and
therefore
culpable—ignorance
,
or
in
a
state
of
invincible—or
involuntary—ignorance
.


Where
conscience
is
in
a
state
of
vincible
ignorance
,
we
must
do
our
best
to
set
it
aside
.


In
all
these
cases
Ockham
follows
the
tradition
,
with
one
exception
:
that
of
the
invincibly
erroneous
conscience
(Eardley
2013
:
94–98
)
,
the
state
in
which
the
agent
finds
himself
with
the
correct
universal
principles
,
but
non-culpably
errs
with
respect
to
his
grasp
of
the
circumstances
in
---------------

In
what
sense
does
Ockham
depart
from
the
tradition
?


For
Ockham
,
the
act
of
following
an
invincibly
erroneous
conscience
is
not
merely
excusable
,
as
it
was
For
Aquinas
,
but
“virtuous
and
meritorious”
.


Consider
the
following
example
from
Ockham
.


While
walking
down
the
street
one
day
you
---------------
determine
that
,
although
it
is
theoretically
possible
that
he
could
be
fraud
,
this
seems
unlikely
.


For
Ockham
,
you
are
obliged
in
this
instance
to
follow
your
conscience
,
and
indeed
you
do
.


It
turns
out
,
however
,
that
this
apparent
homeless
person
is
in
fact
a
very
wealthy
person
who
is
impersonating
a
beggar
.


For
Ockham
,
in
following
your
conscience
,
you
are
not
merely
excused
or
absolved
of
your
error
,
but
your
(ignorant
)
act
is
virtuous
and
,
indeed
,
regarded
by
God
as
meritorious
(so
long
,
---------------

Indeed
,
had
he
not
,
while
in
such
error
,
willed
to
help
that
person
,

he
would
have
performed
a
vicious
and
demeritorious
act
because
such

an
act
would
have
been
knowingly
elicited
against
conscience
and

against
non-culpable
reason
,
because
in
the
aforementioned
case
he

does
not
know
that
he
is
in
error
but
believes
that
he
possesses
right
---------------

What
is
motivating
Ockham’s
novel
suggestion
?


Even
Aquinas
admitted
that
we
have
an
obligation
to
follow
our
consciences
,
whether
right
or
erroneous
.


When
we
do
not
do
so
,
according
to
Aquinas
,
we
sin
.


Of
course
,
when
our
consciences
are
in
a
state
of
voluntary
or
vincible
ignorance
we
also
have
a
duty
to
put
aside
our
error
,
otherwise
we
sin
.


It
is
obviously
not
possible
,
however
,
to
put
error
aside
in
the
case
of
invincible
ignorance
since
such
ignorance
is
by
definition
involuntary
.


Accordingly
,
for
Aquinas
,
we
are
obliged
to
follow
such
a
conscience
.


Although
we
act
wrongly
,
in
such
cases
,
we
are
,
for
Aquinas
,
excused
on
the
grounds
that
we
could
not
have
known
better
.


To
return
to
Aquinas’s
---------------
such
an
act
might
be
considered
virtuous
,
much
less
meritorious
.


But
for
Ockham
,
if
it
is
vicious
and
therefore
punishable
not
to
follow
an
invincibly
erroneous
conscience
,
then
merely
being
excused
for
following
it
when
we
are
under
a
moral
obligation
to
do
so
would
be
an
insufficient
reward
.


Rather
,
it
should
logically
follow
that

Moral
Conscience

From
the
Catechism
of
the
Catholic
Church
,
Simplified
---------------
An
Inner
Law
(1776
)

Deep
within
his
conscience
,
man
discovers
a
law
which
he
must
obey
,
namely
to
do
good
and
to
avoid
evil
.


In
his
conscience
(man
'
s
most
secret
core
)
he
is
alone
with
God
whose
voice
echoes
within
man
.



Conscience
-
Judge
of
Individual
Acts
(1777-1779
)

Moral
conscience
urges
a
person
to
do
good
and
avoid
evil
.


It
even
judges
his
particular
choices
(past
,
present
,
and
future
)
and
shows
God
'
s
authority
.


The
prudent
man
hears
God
speaking
in
his
commandments
.



By
conscience
,
the
person
'
s
reason
judges
the
morality
of
his
actions

(past
,
present
,
or
future
)
.


In
this
judgment
,
man
sees
God
'
s
law
.


"Conscience
is
a
messenger
of
him
who
speaks
to
us
behind
a
veil
and
teaches
us
by
his
representatives
.


Conscience
is
the
aboriginal
Vicar
of
Christ"
(John
Cardinal
Newman
)
.



Every
person
must
have
sufficient
interior
awareness
so
he
can
hear
and
follow
his
conscience
.


"Turn
inward
,
brethren
,
and
in
everything
you
do
,
see
God
as
your
witness"
(St
.


Augustine
)
.



An
Upright
Conscience
Assumes
Responsibility
(1780-1782
)

Human
dignity
requires
an
upright
conscience
which
knows
moral
principles
and
applies
them
in
each
circumstance
.


Truth
is
recognized
by
prudent
judgments
.


Whoever
follows
his
conscience
is
indeed
prudent
.



By
conscience
,
a
person
assumes
responsibility
.


Even
in
evil
deeds
,
conscience
remains
an
inner
witness
to
truth
that
the
choice
was
evil
.


This
true
judgment
makes
clear
that
the
person
must
seek
forgiveness
and
choose
good
in
the
future
.


"Whenever
our
hearts
condemn
us
,
we
reassure
---------------

Man
has
a
right
to
make
his
own
moral
decisions
.


He
cannot
be
forced
to
act
contrary
to
his
conscience
,
nor
be
prevented
from
acting
according
to
his
conscience
,
especially
in
religious
matters
.



Man
'
s
Duty
-
To
Have
a
Right
Conscience
(1783-1785
)

The
person
has
a
duty
to
have
a
true
conscience
which
is
formed
by
reason
and
seeks
to
know
God
'
s
will
.


Only
the
educating
of
conscience
can
overcome
negative
influences
and
temptations
.



---------------
guarantees
peace
of
heart
.



The
Word
of
God
guides
this
education
.


Man
must
examine
his
conscience
before
the
cross
,
seek
the
advice
of
others
,
and
learn
the
Church
'
s
authoritative
teaching
.


---------------
Difficulties
in
Judging
(1786-1789
)

Conscience
can
make
a
right
judgment
(in
accord
with
God
'
s
law
and
reason
)
or
an
erroneous
judgment
(not
in
accord
)
.



---------------

Although
a
person
must
always
obey
the
certain
judgments
of
his
conscience
,
he
might
be
in
ignorance
and
make
erroneous
judgments
.



Sometimes
,
the
person
is
to
blame
for
having
an
erroneous
conscience
because
he
took
no
effort
to
discover
the
truth
.


In
this
case
,
he
is
responsible
for
the
evil
he
commits
.


---------------
blameworthy
.


He
should
work
to
correct
his
errors
.



Conscience
must
be
enlightened
by
faith
so
that
persons
and
groups
will
turn
aside
from
blind
choices
.

Collective
consciousness
,
collective
conscience
,
or
collective
conscious

(French
:
conscience
collective
)
is
the
set
of
shared
beliefs
,
ideas
,
and
moral
attitudes
which
operate
as
a
unifying
force
within
society
.


^
(
[1
]
)
In
general
,
it
does
not
refer
to
the
specifically
moral
conscience
,
but
to
a
shared
understanding
of
social
norms
.


^
(
[2
]
)

---------------

The
term
was
introduced
by
the
French
sociologist
Émile
Durkheim
in
his
The
Division
of
Labour
in
Society
in
1893
.


The
French
word
conscience
generally
means
"conscience"
,
"consciousness"
,
"awareness"
,
^
(
[6
]
)
or
"perception"
.


^
(
[7
]
)
Given
the
multiplicity
of
definitions
,
translators
of
Durkheim
disagree
on
which
is
most
appropriate
,
or
whether
the
translation
should
depend
on
the
context
.


Some
prefer
to
treat
the
word

'
conscience
'

as
an
untranslatable
foreign
word
or
technical
term
,
without
its
normal
English
meaning
.


^
(
[8
]
)
As
for
"collective"
,
Durkheim
makes
clear
that
he
is
not
reifying
or
hypostasizing
this
concept
;
for

Émile
Durkheim
,
a
pioneering
figure
in
sociology
,
coined
the
French
term
"conscience
collective
.

"
His
idea
of
collective
consciousness
refers
to
beliefs
and
sentiments
common
to
average
members
of
society
,
forming
a
determinate
system
that
has
its
own
life
.


According
to
Durkheim
,
this
Updated

Collective
consciousness
(sometimes
collective
conscience
or
conscious
)
is
a
fundamental
sociological
concept
that
refers
to
the
set
of
shared
beliefs
,
ideas
,
attitudes
,
and
knowledge
that
are
common
to
a
social
---------------
This
is
why
we
can
form
collectives
and
work
together
to
achieve
community
and
functional
societies
.


The
collective
consciousness
,
or conscience
collective as
he
wrote
it
in
French
,
is
the
source
of
this
solidarity
.
