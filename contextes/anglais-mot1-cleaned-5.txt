Moral
Conscience

From
the
Catechism
of
the
Catholic
Church
,
Simplified
---------------
An
Inner
Law
(1776)

Deep
within
his
conscience
,
man
discovers
a
law
which
he
must
obey
,
namely
to
do
good
and
to
avoid
evil
.


In
his
conscience
(man
'
s
most
secret
core)
he
is
alone
with
God
whose
voice
echoes
within
man
.



Conscience
-
Judge
of
Individual
Acts
(1777-1779)

Moral
conscience
urges
a
person
to
do
good
and
avoid
evil
.


It
even
judges
his
particular
choices
(past
,
present
,
and
future)
and
shows
God
'
s
authority
.


The
prudent
man
hears
God
speaking
in
his
commandments
.



By
conscience
,
the
person
'
s
reason
judges
the
morality
of
his
actions
(past
,
present
,
or
future)
.


In
this
judgment
,
man
sees
God
'
s
law
.


"Conscience
is
a
messenger
of
him
who
speaks
to
us
behind
a
veil
and
teaches
us
by
his
representatives
.


Conscience
is
the
aboriginal
Vicar
of
Christ"
(John
Cardinal
Newman)
.



Every
person
must
have
sufficient
interior
awareness
so
he
can
hear
and
follow
his
conscience
.


"Turn
inward
,
brethren
,
and
in
everything
you
do
,
see
God
as
your
witness"
(St
.


Augustine)
.



An
Upright
Conscience
Assumes
Responsibility
(1780-1782)

Human
dignity
requires
an
upright
conscience
which
knows
moral
principles
and
applies
them
in
each
circumstance
.


Truth
is
recognized
by
prudent
judgments
.


Whoever
follows
his
conscience
is
indeed
prudent
.



By
conscience
,
a
person
assumes
responsibility
.


Even
in
evil
deeds
,
conscience
remains
an
inner
witness
to
truth
that
the
choice
was
evil
.


This
true
judgment
makes
clear
that
the
person
must
seek
forgiveness
and
choose
good
in
the
future
.


"Whenever
our
hearts
condemn
us
,
we
reassure
---------------

Man
has
a
right
to
make
his
own
moral
decisions
.


He
cannot
be
forced
to
act
contrary
to
his
conscience
,
nor
be
prevented
from
acting
according
to
his
conscience
,
especially
in
religious
matters
.



Man
'
s
Duty
-
To
Have
a
Right
Conscience
(1783-1785)

The
person
has
a
duty
to
have
a
true
conscience
which
is
formed
by
reason
and
seeks
to
know
God
'
s
will
.


Only
the
educating
of
conscience
can
overcome
negative
influences
and
temptations
.



---------------
guarantees
peace
of
heart
.



The
Word
of
God
guides
this
education
.


Man
must
examine
his
conscience
before
the
cross
,
seek
the
advice
of
others
,
and
learn
the
Church
'
s
authoritative
teaching
.


---------------
Difficulties
in
Judging
(1786-1789)

Conscience
can
make
a
right
judgment
(in
accord
with
God
'
s
law
and
reason)
or
an
erroneous
judgment
(not
in
accord)
.



---------------

Although
a
person
must
always
obey
the
certain
judgments
of
his
conscience
,
he
might
be
in
ignorance
and
make
erroneous
judgments
.



Sometimes
,
the
person
is
to
blame
for
having
an
erroneous
conscience
because
he
took
no
effort
to
discover
the
truth
.


In
this
case
,
he
is
responsible
for
the
evil
he
commits
.


---------------
blameworthy
.


He
should
work
to
correct
his
errors
.



Conscience
must
be
enlightened
by
faith
so
that
persons
and
groups
will
turn
aside
from
blind
choices
.
