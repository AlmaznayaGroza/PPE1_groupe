an upright conscience assumes responsibility 17801782

human dignity requires an upright conscience which knows moral
principles and applies them in each circumstance

 truth is recognized by
prudent judgments

 whoever follows his conscience is indeed prudent



by conscience a person assumes responsibility

 even in evil deeds
conscience remains an inner witness to truth that the choice was evil


this true judgment makes clear that the person must seek forgiveness and
choose good in the future

 whenever our hearts condemn us we reassure


man has a right to make his own moral decisions

 he cannot be forced to
act contrary to his conscience nor be prevented from acting according
to his conscience especially in religious matters



man s duty to have a right conscience 17831785

the person has a duty to have a true conscience which is formed by
reason and seeks to know god s will

 only the educating of conscience
can overcome negative influences and temptations




guarantees peace of heart



the word of god guides this education

 man must examine his conscience
before the cross seek the advice of others and learn the church s
authoritative teaching



difficulties in judging 17861789

conscience can make a right judgment in accord with god s law and
reason or an erroneous judgment not in accord





although a person must always obey the certain judgments of his
conscience he might be in ignorance and make erroneous judgments



sometimes the person is to blame for having an erroneous conscience
because he took no effort to discover the truth

 in this case he is
responsible for the evil he commits



blameworthy

 he should work to correct his errors



conscience must be enlightened by faith so that persons and groups will
turn aside from blind choices
