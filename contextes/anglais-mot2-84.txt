Double consciousness

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Internal conflict of society's oppressed
   Not to be confused with Dual consciousness.

   Double consciousness is the dual self-perception^[1] experienced by
   subordinated or colonized groups in an oppressive society. The term and
   the idea were first published in W. E. B. Du Bois's autoethnographic
   work, The Souls of Black Folk in 1903, in which he described the
   African American experience of double consciousness, including his
   own.^[2]

   Originally, double consciousness was specifically the psychological
   challenge African Americans experienced of "always looking at one's
   self through the eyes" of a racist white society and "measuring oneself

   the Atlantic Monthly.^[4] It was later republished and slightly edited
   under the title "Of Our Spiritual Strivings" in his book, The Souls of
   Black Folk. Du Bois describes double consciousness as follows:

     It is a peculiar sensation, this double-consciousness, this sense of
     always looking at one's self through the eyes of others, of
     measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused

   The concept of double consciousness has been expanded on by many
   different scholars in the 20th and early 21st centuries. Commentators
   have examined how the concept can be expanded to other aspects of the

   especially for marking a turning point in the study of the African
   diasporas.^[6] His book The Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double
   Consciousness (1993) introduces the "Black Atlantic" as a source for
   cultural construction.^[7] Gilroy pioneers a shift in contemporary
   black studies by arguing for a rejection of the notion of a homogeneous
--
   trade and marked it as the foundation for the diaspora. He recognized
   the significance of European and African transnational travel as a
   foundation for double consciousness. Gilroy used Du Bois's theory of
   double consciousness to suggest there exists an internal struggle to
   reconcile being both European and Black, which was his main focus in
   his book.^[7] He even characterized the Black Atlantic by the influence

   Very similarly to Du Bois, Frantz Fanon touched upon the term of double
   consciousness in his life. In his first book, Black Skin, White Masks,
   where he expressed his hopelessness at being neither white nor black.
   Fanon identifies the double consciousness that African Americans face
   and its source; he claimed the cultural and social confusions of
   African Americans were caused by European culture.^[10] He gave
   examples of things that he has encountered that demonstrate the double
   consciousness. He talks about people who preach about completely
   conforming to being white and says that they are wrong. He also says
   that the people who believe that complete rejection of whites are also

   In addition to this he talks about the way white men talk to African
   Americans and how it contributes to this problem of double
   consciousness. He says that when a white man talks to an African
   American man he is changing his language to a way in which a
   stereotypical black man would talk, similarly to how one would talk to

   Stephen Greenblatt also uses it to describe the peculiar quality of
   Shakespeare's consciousness in his biography of the bard, Will in the
   World (2004).^[13]

Triple consciousness

   [edit]

   In the 21st century, Du Bois's theory of double consciousness has been
   revisited to develop a more inclusive concept of triple consciousness.
   This triple consciousness may include another intersecting identity
   that impacts a person's social experiences. Additional identities that
   may affect the already present double consciousness experience might
   include ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, etc. For example, Juan
   Flores identified ethnicity as a potential aspect that influences
   double consciousness by speculating Afro-Latinos in the U.S.
   experienced an added layer of discrimination that combined skin color
   with ethnicity and nationality.^[14] Anna Julia Cooper similarly

   womanhood, without violence and without suing or special patronage,
   then and there the whole ... race enters with me".^[15] Finally,
   Jossianna Arroyo explains that triple consciousness brings "spaces,
   culture, and skin ... [to] re-contextualize blackness"^[16] in the case
   of black Puerto Ricans.

   Just like any other thought in critical race analysis, double
   consciousness theory cannot be divorced from gender. This is where
   black feminists have introduced their concept of the triple
   consciousness.^[17] Black women not only have to see themselves through
   the lens of blackness and whiteness, but also through the lens of
   patriarchy. Whenever they are in black spaces, women still have to

   The theory of double consciousness is also heavily present for female
   diasporic artists. These artists are faced with the task of remaining
   authentic to their roots while still branding themselves in a way to

   "White Power", by Kwame Ture (formerly known as Stokely Carmichael) and
   Charles V. Hamilton, provides evidence backing up the ideology of
   double consciousness in regards to black people in the United States.
   The book opens up by defining racism as "the predication of decisions
   and policies on considerations of race for the purpose of subordinating
--
   themselves in terms of the oppressive population, white. Individual
   racism and institutional racism both contribute to double
   consciousness. On an individual level, double consciousness is
   practiced within every day interactions, and on an institutional level,
   it impacts how black people function throughout society. "Black People

   Black population in the United States are essentially equal to whites
   under written law, there remain deeply rooted inequities between the
   races that reinforce double consciousness. Because these differences
   are not evident under the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights,
   they are an experience.

   Even though the framework of double consciousness can be applied to an
   African Diaspora and Transnationality, the nuances of racial dynamics
   differ from nation to nation. In Germany, for example, the political

   Reich, the psychological dilemmas of "two-ness" did not necessarily map
   onto the double consciousness dynamic W. E. B. Du Bois first identified
   in 1897. For Black Germans in the early 20th century, there was no
   stable idea or community of blackness with which they could fully, or
