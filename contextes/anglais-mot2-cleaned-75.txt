"Level
of
consciousness"
(LOC
)
is
a
medical
term
used
to
describe
how
awake
,
alert
,
and
aware
you
are
.


It
also
refers
to
how
well
you
respond
to
attempts
to
get
your
attention
.


A
person
with
an
altered
level
of
consciousness
may
have
decreased
cognitive
function
or
be
difficult
to
arouse
.



A
variety
of
medical
conditions
and
drugs
can
affect
your
level
of
consciousness
,
from
having
dementia
or
lethargy
to
being
in
a
coma
.


Sometimes
impaired
consciousness
is
reversible
,
while
other
times
it
is
not
.



This
article
covers
normal
and
altered
states
of
consciousness
as
well
as
coma
classifications
.

What
Is
Consciousness
?




Medical
definitions
say
a
normal
LOC
means
a
person
is
either awake
or
can
be
readily
awakened
from
normal
sleep
.


Terms
include
:

-
Consciousness
:
A
state
in
which
a
person
is
awake
,
aware
,
alert
,
and

responsive
to
stimuli
-
Decreased
consciousness
:
A
person
appears
awake
and
aware
of
their

surroundings
(conscious
)
but
is
not
responding
normally
(acts

confused
,
odd
,
or
sleepy
)
.


-
Unconsciousness
:
A
person
has
a
deficit
in
awareness
and

responsiveness
to
stimuli
(touch
,
light
,
sound
)

Sleeping
is
not
considered
unconsciousness
if
waking
up
would
result
in
normal
consciousness
Between
consciousness
and
unconsciousness
there
are
several
altered
levels
,
each
with
its
own
definition
.




Altered
Level
of
Consciousness


Altered
or
abnormal
levels
of
consciousness
are
states
in
which
you
either
have
decreased
cognitive
function
or
cannot
be
easily
aroused
.



Most
medical
conditions
affect
the
brain
and
impair
consciousness
when
they
become
serious
or
life-threatening
.


An
altered
LOC
usually
signals
a
serious
medical
problem
.

of
Consciousness

,
stupor

Assessment
Scale


Levels
of
consciousness
can
be
subdivided
into
levels
that
further
clarify
your
degree
of
unresponsiveness
