   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   This article is about the conscience clause in medicine. For the
   conscience clause in the 19th century English educational system, see
   Conscience clause (education).

   Conscience clauses are legal clauses attached to laws in some parts of
   the United States and other countries which permit pharmacists,
   physicians, and/or other providers of health care not to provide
   certain medical services for reasons of religion or conscience. It can
   also involve parents withholding consenting for particular treatments
   for their children.^[1]

   Conscience clauses have been adopted by a number of U.S. states.
   including Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,
   Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi,
   Pennsylvania, and South Dakota. There are some recent comprehensive
   reviews of federal and state conscience clause laws across the United
   States and in select other countries.^[5]

   States have historically provided a conscience clause right allowing
   pharmacists to refrain from participating in abortions.^[11] In April
   2005, Governor Rod Blagojevich by emergency executive order required

   pharmacists, doctors, and hospitals have a professional duty to fulfill
   patients' legal medical needs, regardless of their own ethical stances.
   Opponents see conscience clauses as an attempt to limit reproductive
   rights in lieu of bans struck down by Supreme Court rulings such as Roe
   v. Wade.^[29] Though the case has been overturned by Dobbs v. Jackson
   Women's Health Organization.

   As a result, the term "conscience clause" is controversial and
   primarily used by those who support these provisions. Those who oppose
   them often prefer to use the term "refusal clause," implying that those

   In 2018, Roger Severino, the then-Director of the Office for Civil
   Rights at the United States Department of Health and Human Services,
   criticized those who oppose conscience clauses, saying “[t]here’s a
   movement that tries to squelch dissent on the question of abortion so

   The conscience clause is widely invoked in Catholic universities,
   hospitals, and agencies because the Catholic Church opposes abortion,
   contraceptives, sterilization, and embryonic stem cell treatments.
   Opponents of related FOCA legislation have interpreted the possible end
   of the conscience clause as a demand to either "do abortions or
   close."^[31] Timothy Dolan has said, "“In effect, the president is
   saying we have a year to figure out how to violate our
   consciences."^[32] However, conscience clauses are sometimes
   interpreted differently and their use will often depend on the given
   context.^[33]

   Three members of the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and
   Reproductive Sciences and the Bixby Center for Global Reproductive
   Health at UCSF have questioned whether "conscience clauses" are
   ethical, writing in a journal article that "in some Catholic-owned
   hospitals, the private patient–physician relationship, patient safety,
