   Activism which use awareness campaigns

   Consciousness raising (also called awareness raising) is a form of
   activism popularized by United States feminists in the late 1960s. It
   often takes the form of a group of people attempting to focus the

   Until the early-17th century, English speakers used the word
   "consciousness" in the sense of "moral knowledge of right or wrong"—a
   concept today referred to as "conscience".^[3]

   Consciousness raising groups were formed by New York Radical Women, an
   early Women's Liberation group in New York City, and quickly spread
   throughout the United States. In November 1967, a group including
--
   Amatniek), and Carol Hanisch began meeting in Koedt's apartment.
   Meetings often involved "going around the room and talking" about
   issues in their own lives. The phrase "consciousness raising" was
   coined to describe the process when Kathie Sarachild took up the phrase
   from Anne Forer:

     In the Old Left, they used to say that the workers don't know
     they're oppressed, so we have to raise their consciousness. One
     night at a meeting I said, 'Would everybody please give me an
     example from their own life on how they experienced oppression as a
     woman? I need to hear it to raise my own consciousness.' Kathie was
     sitting behind me and the words rang in her mind. From then on she
     sort of made it an institution and called it consciousness-raising.

   — Anne Forer^[4]

   On Thanksgiving 1968, Kathie Sarachild presented A Program for Feminist
   Consciousness Raising, at the First National Women's Liberation
   Conference near Chicago, Illinois, in which she explained the
   principles behind consciousness-raising and outlined a program for the
   process that the New York groups had developed over the past year.
   Groups founded by former members of New York Radical Women—in
   particular Redstockings, founded out of the breakup of the NYRW in
   1969, and New York Radical Feminists—promoted consciousness raising and
   distributed mimeographed sheets of suggesting topics for consciousness
   raising group meetings. New York Radical Feminists organized
   neighborhood-based c.r. groups in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens,
   involving as many as four hundred women in c.r. groups at its peak.^[5]
   Over the next few years, small-group consciousness raising spread
   rapidly in cities and suburbs throughout the United States. By 1971,
   the Chicago Women's Liberation Union, which had already organized
   several consciousness raising groups in Chicago, described small
   consciousness raising groups as "the backbone of the Women's Liberation
   Movement".^[6] Susan Brownmiller, a member of the West Village^[a]
   would later write that small-group consciousness raising "was the
   movement's most successful form of female bonding, and the source of
   most of its creative thinking. Some of the small groups stayed together
--
   misunderstood as "personal," or as the results of conflicts between the
   personalities of individual men and women, rather than systematic forms
   of oppression. Raising consciousness meant helping oneself and helping
   others to become politically conscious. Consciousness raising groups
   aimed to get a better understanding of women's oppression by bringing
   women together to discuss and analyze their lives, without interference
   from the presence of men.^[9]

   While explaining the theory behind consciousness raising in a 1973
   talk, Kathie Sarachild remarked that "From the beginning of
   consciousness-raising ... there has been no one method of raising
   consciousness. What really counts in consciousness-raising are not
   methods, but results. The only 'methods' of consciousness raising are
   essentially principles. They are the basic radical political principles
   of going to the original sources, both historic and personal, going to
   people—women themselves, and going to experience for theory and
   strategy".^[10] However, most consciousness raising groups did follow a
   similar pattern for meeting and discussion. Meetings would usually be
   held about once a week, with a small group of women, often in the
--
   based on the first-hand knowledge that was shared.^[citation needed]

   Some feminist advocates of consciousness raising argued that the
   process allowed women to analyze the conditions of their own lives, and
   to discover ways in which what had seemed like isolated, individual
--
   and then to actions".^[11]

   Ellen Willis wrote in 1984 that consciousness raising has often been
   "misunderstood and disparaged as a form of therapy", but that it was,
   in fact, in its time and context, "the primary method of understanding
--
   philosophical assumptions".^[12]

   However, some in the feminist movement criticised consciousness raising
   groups as "trivial" and apolitical.^[13]

   Historically, poetry has been used as a consciousness-raising tactic by
   consciousness-raising groups.^[14] Activist and writer Audre Lorde was
   noted to have been one of many scholars who wrote of poetry as a means
   of communication for women of color activist and resistance
   groups.^[15] This focus has also been studied by other feminist
   scholars as a new approach to women's literary writing experience,^[16]
   and the usage of critical consciousness through the creation of art as
   a liberatory praxis.^[17] Art as a liberatory praxis has also been
   explored through a radical queer lens through a number of publications

   In the 1960s, consciousness-raising caught on with gay liberation
   activists,^[20] who formed the first "coming-out groups" which helped
   participants come out of the closet among welcoming, tolerant
   individuals and share personal stories about coming out. The idea of
   coming out as a tool of consciousness-raising had been preceded by even
   earlier opinions from German theorists such as Magnus Hirschfeld, Iwan
   Bloch and Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, all of whom saw self-disclosure as a
   means of self-emancipation, the raising of consciousness among fellow
   un-closeted individuals and a means of raising awareness in the wider
   society.^[citation needed]

   In The God Delusion, anti-religion activist Richard Dawkins uses the
   term "consciousness raising" for several other things, explicitly
   describing these as analogous to the feminist case.^[21] These include
   replacing references to children as Catholic, Muslim, etc. with
   references to children of the adults who are members of these religions
   (which he compares to our using non-sexist terminology) and Darwin as
   "raising our consciousness" in biology to the possibility of explaining
   complexity naturalistically and, in principle, raising our
   consciousness to the possibility of doing such things elsewhere
   (especially in physics).^[21] Earlier in the book, he uses the term
   (without explicitly referring to feminism) to refer to making people
