What
Does
“Conscience”
Mean
?



Conscience
/ˈkɑːnʃəns/
is
a
noun
that
refers
to
the
“inner
feeling

I
advised
my
niece
to
let
her
conscience
guide
her
.



When
someone
has
a
guilty
conscience
,
it
means
that
“they
feel
guilty
about
something
they
did
that
they
perceive
as
wrong
.

”


My
guilty
conscience
kept
me
up
all
night
.



On
the
opposite
side
of
the
spectrum
,
when
someone
has
a
clear
conscience
,
they
feel
that
they
did
the
right
thing
and
therefore
feel
no
guilt
.




My
conscience
was
clear
because
I
knew
I
did
the
right
thing
.

conscience
to
do
what’s

from

what
is
morally
right
