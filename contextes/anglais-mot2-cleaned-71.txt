In
Marxism
,
class
consciousness
is
the
set
of
beliefs
that
persons
hold
regarding
their
social
class
or
economic
rank
in
society
,
the
structure
of
their
class
,
and
their
common
class
interests
.

According
to
Karl
Marx
,
class
consciousness
is
an
awareness
that
is
key
to
sparking
a
revolution
which
would
"create
a
dictatorship
of
the
proletariat
,
transforming
it
from
a
wage-earning
,
propertyless
mass
into
the
ruling
class"
.

Although
Marxists
tend
to
focus
on
class
consciousness
(or
its
absence
)
among
the
proletariat
,
the
upper
classes
in
society
can
also
think
and
act
in
a
class-conscious
way
.


As
Leonard
Fein
pointed
out
,
"The
very
rich
have
been
well
aware
of
their
class
privilege
and
have
labored
mightily
to
protect
and
defend
it"
.

For
example
,
Warren
Buffett
has
demonstrated
class
consciousness
:
"There
'
s
class
warfare
,
all
right
.


.


.


but
it
'
s
my
class
,
the
rich
class
,
that

and

re

reinforced
by
the
new
gentry
who
owed
their
success
to
commerce
,
industry
,
and
the
professions
,
evolved
into
an

'
upper
class
'

(its
consciousness
formed
in
large
part
by
the
Public
Schools
and
Universities
)
which
tenaciously
maintained
control
over
the
political
system
,
depriving
not
only
the
working
classes
but
the
middle
classes
of
---------------
to
become
more
acutely
conscious
of
its
position
in
the
hierarchy
.

(

While
Karl
Marx
rarely
used
the
term
"class
consciousness"
,
he
did
make
the
distinction
between
"class
in
itself"
,
which
is
defined
as
a
stratum
of
society
sharing
common
grievances
and
a
unified
perspective
;
and

education
,
occupation
,
or
status

Whereas
Marx
believed
the
working
class
would
gain
class
consciousness
as
a
result
of
its
experience
of
exploitation
,
later
orthodox
Marxism
,
in
particular
as
formulated
by
Vladimir
Lenin
,
argued
that
the
working
class
,
by
itself
,
could
only
develop
"trade
union
consciousness"
,
which
Lenin
characterized
in
What
Is
to
Be
Done
?


as
"the
conviction
that
it
is
necessary
to
combine
in
unions
,
fight
the
employers
,
and
strive
to
---------------
overcome
this
(in
Lenin
'
s
opinion
)
limited
worldview
,
a
vanguard
party
of
the
most
politically
advanced
section
of
the
working
class
was
needed
to
help
replace
trade
union
consciousness
with
class
consciousness
.

Criticism
---------------

The
Polish
political
philosopher
Leszek
Kolakowski
disputed
the
notion
that
class
consciousness
could
be
instilled
from
outside
by
a
vanguard
party
.


In
Main
Currents
of
Marxism
and
his
other
writings
,
he
stated
that
in
order
to
achieve
a
unity
of
theory
and
praxis
,
theory
must
not
---------------
"expression
of
the
revolutionary
process
itself"
.


In
turn
,
a
theory
which
has
as
its
goal
helping
the
proletariat
achieve
class
consciousness
must
first
be
an
"objective
theory
of
class
consciousness"
.


However
,
theory
in
itself
is
insufficient
,
and
ultimately
relies
on
the
struggle
of
humankind
and
of
the
proletariat
for
consciousness
:
the
"objective
theory
of
class
consciousness
is
only
the
theory
of
its
objective
possibility"
.

Austrian
School
economist
Ludwig
von
Mises
asserted
that
"Marx
confus
[ed
]
the
notions
of
caste
and
class"
.


Mises
allowed
that
class
consciousness
and
the
associated

struggle

concepts
in
some
circumstances

rigid
social
castes

knowledge
,
became
the
peculiar
ideological
instrument
to
justify
a

new
idea
of
the
party
of
manipulators
.


Since
the
working
class
is
in

principle
incapable
of
articulating
theoretically
its
consciousness
,

it
is
possible
and
even
necessary
that
the
"genuine"
theoretical

consciousness
of
the
working
class
should
be
incarnated
in
a

political
organism
that
could
consider
itself
the
carrier
of
this

consciousness
regardless
of
what
the
"empirical"
working
class

thought
about
it
,
given
that
the
"empirical"
consciousness
of
this

class
is
irrelevant
in
defining
who
in
a
given
moment
represents
its

interest
.


This
is
why
the
theory
of
class
consciousness
instilled

from
outside
and
the
whole
idea
of
scientific
socialism
so
conceived

served
to
justify
the
fact
that
in
all
kinds
of
political
activity

and
later
in
the
exercise
of
political
power
,
the
working
class
may

be
and
must
be
replaced
by
the
political
apparatus
which
is
the

vehicle
of
its
consciousness
at
the
highest
level
.

and

Stalinist
