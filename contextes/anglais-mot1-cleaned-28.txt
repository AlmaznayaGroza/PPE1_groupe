Types
of
Conscience

Text
:
1
Timothy
1
:5

One
of
the
goals
of
preaching/teaching
the
word
of
God
is
a
“good
conscience
.

”
Our
conscience
is
designed
to
help
guide
us
to
do
what
is
right
(“right”
depends
on
how
it
is
trained
)
.


If
we
want
to
accomplish
this
goal
,
we
need
to
understand
more
about
the
conscience
.


There
are
at
least
six
different
types
of
conscience
addressed
in
the
New
Testament
.


We
will
consider
them
here
.



Good
Conscience

-
A good
conscience
is
one
which
is
free
from
guilt
–
we
are
doing

what
we
believe
to
be
right
;
used
two
different
ways
in
the
NT
(of

those
who
did
right
and
those
who
did
wrong
)
-
Those
who
do
right
are
to
have
a good
conscience
(1
Timothy
1
:5
)
–

keep
a
good
conscience
(1
Timothy
1
:19
)
;
if
we
follow
God
,
we
can

have
confidence
,
not
fear
(1
John
3
:21
;
2
:28-29
)
-
However
,
it
is
possible
to
do wrong
and
have
a good
conscience
(Acts

23
:1
)
–
Paul
did
many
things
against
Christ
(Acts
26
:9-11
;
1
Timothy

1
:13-15
)
;
he
believed
he
was
right
(Acts
24
:16
)
-
Many
have
a good
conscience
because
they
do
what
“seems
right”
to

them
(Proverbs
14
:12
)
–
but
this
is
not
enough

Defiled
Conscience

-
A defiled
conscience
is
one
which
causes
one
to
feel
guilt
for
doing

what
is
either
right
or
innocent
– right
is
something
required
by

God
(2
Timothy
3
:16-17
)
; innocent
is
not
right
or
wrong
in
itself

(Romans
14
:2-3
)
-
In
Corinth
,
some
had
a defiled
conscience
(1
Corinthians
8
:7
)
–
much

of
the
meat
sold
in
the
markets
in
Corinth
had
been
used
previously

in
idol
worship
;
Paul
explained
that
buying/eating
it
did
not
---------------
-
However
,
those
“accustomed
to
the
idol”
could
not
separate
the
idol

worship
from
eating
(1
Corinthians
8
:7
)
–
for
them
,
to
eat
would

violate
their
conscience
and
embolden
them
to
sin
(1
Corinthians

8
:10-11
;
cf
.


Romans
14
:23
)
-
If
one
has
a defiled
conscience
,
they
need
to
be
patiently
taught

the
truth
(Romans
14
:1
;
cf
.


Acts
18
:26
)

Seared
Conscience

-
A seared
conscience
is
one
that
no
longer
feels
guilt
for
sin
–

whether
one
followed
the
right
or
wrong
standard
,
it
is
a
conscience

that
has
been
violated
so
many
times
that
it
no
longer
works
-
The
Spirit
warned
of
those
who
would
fall
away
due
to
a seared

conscience
(1
Timothy
4
:1-2
)
–
when
one
sins
,
godly
sorrow
leads
him

to
repentance
(2
Corinthians
7
:10
)
;
feels
guilty
,
wants
to
be
right
-
But
when
sin
becomes persistent
and
habitual
,
guilt
is
no
longer

there
(Genesis
6
:5
;
Jeremiah
6
:15
)
-
A seared
conscience
is
prevented
by
laying
aside
sin
(Hebrews
12
:1
)

rather
than
continuing
in
it
(2
Timothy
3
:13
)
–
if
one
has
a seared

conscience
,
little
can
be
done
until
they
have
a
change
of
heart

(Hebrews
6
:4-6
)

Weak
Conscience

-
A weak
conscience
is
one
that
has
simply
not
been
trained
in
what
is

right
–
lacks
knowledge
from
God
that
provides
the
right
standard
-
In
Corinth
,
a weak
conscience
led
to
a defiled
conscience
(1

Corinthians
8
:7
)
–
lacked
knowledge
;
one
can
have
a weak
conscience

and
also
have
a good
conscience
(Acts
23
:1
;
1
Timothy
1
:13
)
-
The
remedy
for
a
weak
conscience
is training
in
the
word
of
God

(Hebrews
5
:14
)

Evil
Conscience

-
An evil
conscience
is
one
that
has
not
been
forgiven
of
sin
(Hebrews

10
:22
)
-
All
have
had
an evil
conscience
at
some
point
(Romans
3
:23
)
–

forgiveness
is
found
in
Christ
(Hebrews
9
:14
;
Ephesians
1
:7
)
;
this

cleanses
the evil
conscience

Clear
(Pure
)
Conscience

-
A clear
(pure
,
KJV
)
conscience
is
one
that
has
been
forgiven
(1

Timothy
3
:9
)
–
cleansed
by
Christ
;
this
is
the good
conscience
of

those
who
do
right
(1
Timothy
1
:5
,
19
;
1
Peter
3
:16
)
-
We
cannot
purify
our
conscience
on
our
own
–
must
appeal
to
God
to

do
it
(1
Peter
3
:21
)
-
God
cleanses
us
when
we
obey
the
gospel
(Romans
6
:3-4
)
–
continues
---------------
Conclusion

-
The
goal
of
our
instruction
is
a
“good
conscience”
–
but
goodness
is

by
God’s
standard
,
not
man’s
-
It
is
not
enough
for
us
to
think
we
are
doing
what
is
right
–
we

must
actually
be
right
;
involves
knowledge
,
obedience
,
and

forgiveness
-
We
can
have
“our
hearts
sprinkled
clean
from
an
evil
conscience”

(Hebrews
10
:22
)
–
done
in
baptism
;
appeal
for
a
good
conscience
(1

Peter
3
:21
)
;
receive
forgiveness
(Acts
22
:16
)
