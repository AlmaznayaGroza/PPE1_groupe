may
have
evolved
to

rather
than individuals

Why
did
the
experience
of
consciousness
evolve
from
our
underlying
brain
physiology
?


Despite
being
a
vibrant
area
of
neuroscience
,
current
research
on
consciousness
is
characterised
by
disagreement
and
controversy
–
with
several
rival
theories
in
contention
.



A
recent
scoping
review
of
over
1
,000
articles
identified
over
20
different
theoretical
accounts
.


Philosophers
like
David
Chalmers
argue
that
no
single
scientific
theory
can
truly
explain
consciousness
.



We
define
consciousness
as
embodied
subjective
awareness
,
including
self
awareness
.


In
a
recent
article
published
in
Interalia
(which
is
not
peer
reviewed)
,
we
argue
that
one
reason
for
this
predicament
is
the
powerful
---------------

We
are
not
alone
.


Social
scientist
Jacy
Reese
Anthis
writes
“much
of
the
debate
on
the
fundamental
nature
of
consciousness
takes
the
form
of
intuition
jousting
,
in
which
the
different
parties
each
report
their
own
strong
intuitions
and
joust
them
against
each
other”
.


---------------
because
they
are
powerfully
endorsed
by
social
and
cultural
concepts
such
as
free
will
,
human
rights
,
democracy
,
justice
and
moral
responsibility
.


All
these
concepts
assume
that
consciousness
plays
a
central
controlling
influence
.



---------------
beliefs
can
be
wrong
.


They
can
also
interfere
with
scientific
literacy
.



Intuitive
accounts
of
consciousness
ultimately
put
us
in
the
driver’s
seat
as
“captain
of
our
own
ship”
.


We
think
we
know
what
consciousness
is
and
what
it
does
from
simply
experiencing
it
.


Mental
thoughts
,
intentions
and
desires
are
seen
as
determining
and
controlling
our
---------------

The
widespread
acceptance
of
these
tacit
intuitive
accounts
helps
explain
,
in
part
,
why
the
formal
study
of
consciousness
was
relegated
to
the
margins
of
mainstream
neuroscience
until
late
20th
century
.



The
problem
for
scientific
models
of
consciousness
remains
accommodating
these
intuitive
accounts
within
a
materialist
framework
consistent
with
the
findings
of
neuroscience
.


While
there
is
no
current
scientific
---------------
Social
purpose

If
that’s
the
case
,
why
did
consciousness
,
defined
as
subjective
awareness
,
evolve
?



Consciousness
presumably
evolved
as
part
of
the
evolution
of
the
nervous
system
.


According
to
several
theories
the
key
adaptive
function
(providing
an
organism
with
survival
and
reproductive
benefits)
of
consciousness
is
to
make
volitional
movement
possible
.


And
volition
is
something
we
ultimately
associate
with
will
,
agency
and
individuality
.


It
is
therefore
easy
to
think
that
consciousness
evolved
to
benefit
us
as
individuals
.



Humans
are
a
highly
social
species
.


Esteban
De
Armas/Shuttestock

But
we
have
argued
that
consciousness
may
have
evolved
to
facilitate
key
social
adaptive
functions
.


Rather
than
helping
individuals
survive
,
it
evolved
to
help
us
broadcast
our
experienced
ideas
and
feelings
into
the
