Perhaps
no
aspect
of
mind
is
more
familiar
or
more
puzzling
than
consciousness
and
our
conscious
experience
of
self
and
world
.


The
problem
of
consciousness
is
arguably
the
central
issue
in
current
theorizing
about
the
mind
.


Despite
the
lack
of
any
agreed
upon
theory
of
consciousness
,
there
is
a
widespread
,
if
less
than
universal
,
consensus
that
an
adequate
account
of
mind
requires
a
clear
understanding
of
it
and
its
place
in
nature
.


We
need
to
understand
both
what
consciousness
is
and
how
it
relates
to
other
,
nonconscious
,
aspects
of
reality
.

Reflexive
theories
---------------
for
as
long
as
there
have
been
humans
.


Neolithic
burial
practices
appear
to
express
spiritual
beliefs
and
provide
early
evidence
for
at
least
minimally
reflective
thought
about
the
nature
of
human
consciousness
(Pearson
1999
,
Clark
and
Riel-Salvatore
2001)
.


Preliterate
cultures
have
similarly
been
found
invariably
to
embrace
some
form
of
spiritual
or
at
---------------
nature
of
conscious
awareness
.



Nonetheless
,
some
have
argued
that
consciousness
as
we
know
it
today
is
a
relatively
recent
historical
development
that
arose
sometime
after
the
Homeric
era
(Jaynes
1974)
.


According
to
this
view
,
earlier
humans
---------------
in
the
ways
we
do
today
.


Others
have
claimed
that
even
during
the
classical
period
,
there
was
no
word
of
ancient
Greek
that
corresponds
to
“consciousness”
(Wilkes
1984
,
1988
,
1995)
.


Though
the
ancients
had
much
to
say
about
mental
matters
,
it
is
less
clear
whether
they
had
any
specific
concepts
or
concerns
for
what
we
now
think
of
as
consciousness
.



Although
the
words
“conscious”
and
“conscience”
are
used
quite
---------------

By
the
beginning
of
the
early
modern
era
in
the
seventeenth
century
,
consciousness
had
come
full
center
in
thinking
about
the
mind
.


Indeed
from
the
mid-17th
through
the
late
19th
century
,
consciousness
was
widely
regarded
as
essential
or
definitive
of
the
mental
.


René
Descartes
defined
the
very
notion
of
thought
(pensée)
in
terms
of
reflexive
consciousness
or
self-awareness
.


In
the
Principles
of
Philosophy
(1640)
he
wrote
,

---------------

Locke
explicitly
forswore
making
any
hypothesis
about
the
substantial
basis
of
consciousness
and
its
relation
to
matter
,
but
he
clearly
regarded
it
as
essential
to
thought
as
well
as
to
personal
identity
.



---------------
mathematical
work
on
differentiation
and
integration
,
offered
a
theory
of
mind
in
the
Discourse
on
Metaphysics
(1686)
that
allowed
for
infinitely
many
degrees
of
consciousness
and
perhaps
even
for
some
thoughts
that
were
unconscious
,
the
so
called
“petites
perceptions”
.


Leibniz
was
the
first
to
distinguish
explicitly
between
perception
and
apperception
,
i
.

e
.


,
roughly
between
awareness
and
self-awareness
.


In
the
Monadology
(1720)
he
also
offered
his
famous
analogy
of
the
mill
to
express
his
belief
that
consciousness
could
not
arise
from
mere
matter
.


He
asked
his
reader
to
imagine
someone
walking
through
an
expanded
brain
as
one
would
walk
through
a
mill
and
observing
all
its
mechanical
---------------
Despite
Leibniz
'
s
recognition
of
the
possibility
of
unconscious
thought
,
for
most
of
the
next
two
centuries
the
domains
of
thought
and
consciousness
were
regarded
as
more
or
less
the
same
.


Associationist
psychology
,
whether
pursued
by
Locke
or
later
in
the
eighteenth
century
by
David
Hume
(1739)
or
in
the
nineteenth
by
James
Mill
(1829)
,
aimed
to
---------------
The
purely
associationist
approach
was
critiqued
in
the
late
eighteenth
century
by
Immanuel
Kant
(1787)
,
who
argued
that
an
adequate
account
of
experience
and
phenomenal
consciousness
required
a
far
richer
structure
of
mental
and
intentional
organization
.


Phenomenal
consciousness
according
to
Kant
could
not
be
a
mere
succession
of
associated
ideas
,
but
at
a
minimum
had
to
be
the
experience
of
a
conscious
self
situated
---------------
study
of
phenomenology
through
the
work
of
Edmund
Husserl
(1913
,
1929)
,
Martin
Heidegger
(1927)
,
Maurice
Merleau-Ponty
(1945)
and
others
who
expanded
the
study
of
consciousness
into
the
realm
of
the
social
,
the
bodily
and
the
interpersonal
.



At
the
outset
of
modern
scientific
psychology
in
the
mid-nineteenth
century
,
the
mind
was
still
largely
equated
with
consciousness
,
and
introspective
methods
dominated
the
field
as
in
the
work
of
Wilhelm
Wundt
(1897)
,
Hermann
von
Helmholtz
(1897)
,
William
James
(1890)
and
Alfred
Titchener
(1901)
.


However
,
the
relation
of
consciousness
to
brain
remained
very
much
a
mystery
as
expressed
in
T
.


H
.


Huxley
'
s
famous
remark
,


How
it
is
that
anything
so
remarkable
as
a
state
of
consciousness

comes
about
as
a
result
of
irritating
nervous
tissue
,
is
just
as

unaccountable
as
the
appearance
of
the
Djin
,
when
Aladdin
rubbed
his

lamp
(1866)
.



The
early
twentieth
century
saw
the
eclipse
of
consciousness
from
scientific
psychology
,
especially
in
the
United
States
with
the
rise
of
behaviorism
(Watson
1924
,
Skinner
1953)
though
movements
such
as
Gestalt
---------------
(Neisser
1965
,
Gardiner
1985)
.


However
,
despite
the
renewed
emphasis
on
explaining
cognitive
capacities
such
as
memory
,
perception
and
language
comprehension
,
consciousness
remained
a
largely
neglected
topic
for
several
further
decades
.



In
the
1980s
and
90s
there
was
a
major
resurgence
of
scientific
and
philosophical
research
into
the
nature
and
basis
of
consciousness
(Baars
1988
,
Dennett
1991
,
Penrose
1989
,
1994
,
Crick
1994
,
Lycan
1987
,
1996
,
Chalmers
1996)
.


Once
consciousness
was
back
under
discussion
,
there
was
a
rapid
proliferation
of
research
with
a
flood
of
books
and
articles
,
as
well
as
the
introduction
of
specialty
journals
(The
Journal
of
Consciousness
Studies
,
Consciousness
and
Cognition
,
Psyche)
,
professional
societies
(Association
for
the
Scientific
Study
of
Consciousness—ASSC)
and
annual
conferences
devoted
exclusively
to
its
investigation
(“The
Science
of
Consciousness”)
.

Concepts
of
Consciousness

The
words
“conscious”
and
“consciousness”
are
umbrella
terms
that
cover
a
wide
variety
of
mental
phenomena
.


Both
are
used
with
a
diversity
of
meanings
,
and
the
adjective
“conscious”
is
heterogeneous
in
its
range
,
being
applied
both
to
whole
organisms—creature
consciousness—and
to
particular
mental
states
and
processes—state
consciousness
(Rosenthal
1986
,
Gennaro
1995
,
Carruthers
2000)
.

1
Creature
Consciousness

An
animal
,
person
or
other
cognitive
system
may
be
regarded
as
conscious
---------------
hypnotized
or
in
a
fugue
state
?



Self-consciousness
.


A
third
and
yet
more
demanding
sense
might
define
conscious
creatures
as
those
that
are
not
only
aware
but
also
aware
that
they
are
aware
,
thus
treating
creature
consciousness
as
a
form
of
self-consciousness
(Carruthers
2000)
.


The
self-awareness
requirement
might
get
interpreted
in
a
variety
of
ways
,
and
which
creatures
would
qualify
as
conscious
in
the
relevant
sense
will
vary
accordingly
.


If
it
---------------
world
through
its
echo-locatory
senses
,
even
though
we
humans
from
our
human
point
of
view
can
not
emphatically
understand
what
such
a
mode
of
consciousness
is
like
from
the
bat
'
s
own
point
of
view
.



Subject
of
conscious
states
.


A
fifth
alternative
would
be
to
define
the
---------------
upon
the
particular
account
one
gives
of
conscious
states
(section
2
.

2)
.



Transitive
Consciousness
.


In
addition
to
describing
creatures
as
conscious
in
these
various
senses
,
there
are
also
related
senses
in
which
creatures
are
described
as
being
conscious
of
various
things
.


The
distinction
is
sometimes
marked
as
that
between
transitive
and
intransitive
notions
of
consciousness
,
with
the
former
involving
some
object
at
which
consciousness
is
directed
(Rosenthal
1986)
.

State
consciousness

The
notion
of
a
conscious
mental
state
also
has
a
variety
of
distinct
---------------

Phenomenal
states
.


Such
qualia
are
sometimes
referred
to
as
phenomenal
properties
and
the
associated
sort
of
consciousness
as
phenomenal
consciousness
,
but
the
latter
term
is
perhaps
more
properly
applied
to
the
overall
structure
of
experience
and
involves
far
more
than
sensory
qualia
.


The
phenomenal
structure
of
consciousness
also
encompasses
much
of
the
spatial
,
temporal
and
conceptual
organization
of
our
experience
of
the
world
and
of
ourselves
as
agents
in
it
(see
section
4
.

3)
.


It
is
therefore
probably
best
,
at
least
initially
,
to
distinguish
the
concept
of
phenomenal
consciousness
from
that
of
qualitative
consciousness
,
though
they
no
doubt
overlap
.



What-it-is-like
states
.


Consciousness
in
both
those
senses
links
up
as
well
with
Thomas
Nagel
'
s
(1974)
notion
of
a
conscious
creature
,
insofar
as
one
might
count
a
mental
state
as
conscious
in
the
“what
it
is
like”
---------------
or
qualitative
state
.



Access
consciousness
.


States
might
be
conscious
in
a
seemingly
quite
different
access
sense
,
which
has
more
to
do
with
intra-mental
relations
.


In
this
respect
,
a
state
'
s
being
conscious
is
a
matter
of
its
availability
to
interact
with
other
states
and
of
the
access
that
one
has
to
its
content
.


In
this
more
functional
sense
,
which
corresponds
to
what
Ned
Block
(1995)
calls
access
consciousness
,
a
visual
state
'
s
being
conscious
is
not
so
much
a
matter
of
whether
or
not
it
has
a
qualitative
“what
it
'
s
likeness”
,
but
of
whether
or
not
it
and
the
visual
---------------
qualitative
or
phenomenal
feel
in
the
Nagel
sense
.



Narrative
consciousness
.


States
might
also
be
regarded
as
conscious
in
a
narrative
sense
that
appeals
to
the
notion
of
the
“stream
of
consciousness”
,
regarded
as
an
ongoing
more
or
less
serial
narrative
of
episodes
from
the
perspective
of
an
actual
or
merely
virtual
self
.


The
idea
would
be
to
equate
the
person
'
s
conscious
mental
states
with
those
---------------
independently
specified
,
they
are
obviously
not
without
potential
links
,
nor
do
they
exhaust
the
realm
of
possible
options
.


Drawing
connections
,
one
might
argue
that
states
appear
in
the
stream
of
consciousness
only
in
so
far
as
we
are
aware
of
them
,
and
thus
forge
a
bond
between
the
first
meta-mental
notion
of
a
conscious
state
and
the
stream
or
---------------
conscious
mental
states
.

Consciousness
as
an
entity

The
noun
“consciousness”
has
an
equally
diverse
range
of
meanings
that
largely
parallel
those
of
the
adjective
“conscious”
.


Distinctions
can
be
drawn
between
creature
and
state
consciousness
as
well
as
among
the
varieties
of
each
.


One
can
refer
specifically
to
phenomenal
consciousness
,
access
consciousness
,
reflexive
or
meta-mental
consciousness
,
and
narrative
consciousness
among
other
varieties
.



Here
consciousness
itself
is
not
typically
treated
as
a
substantive
entity
but
merely
the
abstract
reification
of
whatever
property
or
aspect
is
attributed
by
the
relevant
use
of
the
adjective
“conscious”
.


Access
consciousness
is
just
the
property
of
having
the
required
sort
of
internal
access
relations
,
and
qualitative
consciousness
is
simply
the
property
that
is
attributed
when
“conscious”
is
applied
in
the
qualitative
sense
to
mental
states
.


How
much
this
commits
one
to
the
ontological
status
of
consciousness
per
se
will
depend
on
how
much
of
a
Platonist
one
is
about
universals
in
general
.


(See
the
entry
on
the
medieval
problem
of
universals
.

)
It
need
not
commit
one
to
consciousness
as
a
distinct
entity
any
more
than
one
'
s
use
of
“square”
,
“red”
or
“gentle”
commits
one
to
the
existence
of
squareness
,
redness
or
---------------

Though
it
is
not
the
norm
,
one
could
nonetheless
take
a
more
robustly
realist
view
of
consciousness
as
a
component
of
reality
.


That
is
one
could
think
of
consciousness
as
more
on
a
par
with
electromagnetic
fields
than
with
life
.



---------------
relations
among
particles
.



Similarly
one
could
regard
“consciousness”
as
referring
to
a
component
or
aspect
of
reality
that
manifests
itself
in
conscious
states
and
creatures
but
is
more
than
merely
the
abstract
nominalization
of
the
---------------
logical
space
of
options
.



There
are
thus
many
concepts
of
consciousness
,
and
both
“conscious”
and
“consciousness”
are
used
in
a
wide
range
of
ways
with
no
privileged
or
canonical
meaning
.


However
,
this
may
be
less
of
an
embarrassment
than
an
embarrassment
of
riches
.


Consciousness
is
a
complex
feature
of
the
world
,
and
understanding
it
will
require
a
diversity
of
conceptual
tools
for
dealing
with
its
many
differing
aspects
.


Conceptual
plurality
is
thus
just
what
one
would
hope
for
.


As
long
as
one
avoids
confusion
by
being
clear
about
one
'
s
meanings
,
there
is
great
value
in
having
a
variety
of
concepts
by
which
we
can
access
and
grasp
consciousness
in
all
its
rich
complexity
.


However
,
one
should
not
assume
that
conceptual
plurality
implies
referential
divergence
.


Our
multiple
concepts
of
consciousness
may
in
fact
pick
out
varying
aspects
of
a
single
unified
underlying
mental
phenomenon
.


Whether
and
to
what
extent
they
do
so
remains
an
open
question
.

Problems
of
Consciousness

The
task
of
understanding
consciousness
is
an
equally
diverse
project
.


Not
only
do
many
different
aspects
of
mind
count
as
conscious
in
some
sense
,
each
is
also
open
to
various
respects
in
which
it
might
be
explained
or
modeled
.


Understanding
consciousness
involves
a
multiplicity
not
only
of
explananda
but
also
of
questions
that
they
pose
and
the
sorts
of
answers
they
require
.


At
the
risk
of
oversimplifying
,
---------------
What
,
How
,
and
Why
questions
:

-
The
Descriptive
Question
:
What
is
consciousness
?


What
are
its

principal
features
?


And
by
what
means
can
they
be
best
discovered
,

described
and
modeled
?


-
The
Explanatory
Question
:
How
does
consciousness
of
the
relevant

sort
come
to
exist
?


Is
it
a
primitive
aspect
of
reality
,
and
if
not

how
does
(or
could)
consciousness
in
the
relevant
respect
arise
from

or
be
caused
by
nonconscious
entities
or
processes
?


-
The
Functional
Question
:
Why
does
consciousness
of
the
relevant
sort

exist
?


Does
it
have
a
function
,
and
if
so
what
is
it
?


Does
it
act

causally
and
if
so
with
what
sorts
of
effects
?


Does
it
make
a
---------------

The
three
questions
focus
respectively
on
describing
the
features
of
consciousness
,
explaining
its
underlying
basis
or
cause
,
and
explicating
its
role
or
value
.


The
divisions
among
the
three
are
of
course
somewhat
artificial
,
and
in
practice
the
answers
one
gives
to
each
will
depend
in
part
on
what
one
says
about
the
others
.


One
can
not
,
for
example
,
adequately
answer
the
what
question
and
describe
the
main
features
of
consciousness
without
addressing
the
why
issue
of
its
functional
role
within
systems
whose
operations
it
affects
.


Nor
could
one
explain
how
the
relevant
sort
of
consciousness
might
arise
from
nonconscious
processes
unless
one
had
a
clear
account
of
just
what
features
had
to
be
caused
or
realized
to
count
as
producing
it
.


Those
caveats
---------------
structure
for
articulating
the
overall
explanatory
project
and
for
assessing
the
adequacy
of
particular
theories
or
models
of
consciousness
.

The
descriptive
question
:
What
are
the
features
of
consciousness
?



The
What
question
asks
us
to
describe
and
model
the
principal
features
of
consciousness
,
but
just
which
features
are
relevant
will
vary
with
the
sort
of
consciousness
we
aim
to
capture
.


The
main
properties
of
access
consciousness
may
be
quite
unlike
those
of
qualitative
or
phenomenal
consciousness
,
and
those
of
reflexive
consciousness
or
narrative
consciousness
may
differ
from
both
.


However
,
by
building
up
detailed
theories
of
each
type
,
we
may
hope
to
find
important
links
between
them
and
perhaps
even
to
discover
that
they
coincide
in
at
least
---------------
The
general
descriptive
project
will
require
a
variety
of
investigational
methods
(Flanagan
1992)
.


Though
one
might
naively
regard
the
facts
of
consciousness
as
too
self-evident
to
require
any
systematic
methods
of
gathering
data
,
the
epistemic
task
is
in
reality
far
from
trivial
(Husserl
1913)
.


---------------
The
need
for
third-person
empirical
data
gathered
by
external
observers
is
perhaps
most
obvious
with
regard
to
the
more
clearly
functional
types
of
consciousness
such
as
access
consciousness
,
but
it
is
required
even
with
regard
to
phenomenal
and
qualitative
consciousness
.


For
example
,
deficit
studies
that
correlate
various
neural
and
functional
sites
of
damage
with
abnormalities
of
conscious
experience
can
make
us
aware
of
---------------
introspection
(Libet
1985
,
Wegner
2002)
.


Nor
are
the
facts
gathered
by
these
third
person
methods
merely
about
the
causes
or
bases
of
consciousness
;
they
often
concern
the
very
structure
of
phenomenal
consciousness
itself
.


First-person
,
third-person
and
perhaps
even
second-person
(Varela
1995)
interactive
methods
will
all
be
needed
to
collect
the
requisite
evidence
.



Using
all
these
sources
of
data
,
we
will
hopefully
be
able
to
construct
detailed
descriptive
models
of
the
various
sorts
of
consciousness
.


Though
the
specific
features
of
most
importance
may
vary
among
the
different
types
,
our
overall
descriptive
project
will
need
to
address
at
least
the
following
seven
general
aspects
of
consciousness
(sections
4
.

.

apt
ways
to

lacks
such
qualia
,
then
it
might
count
as
conscious
at
best
in
a
loose
and
less
than
literal
sense
.


Or
so
at
least
it
would
seem
to
those
who
take
qualitative
consciousness
in
the
“what
it
is
like”
sense
to
be
philosophically
and
scientifically
central
(Nagel
1974
,
Chalmers
1996)
.


---------------
structure
as
involving
a
special
kind
of
intentional
and
representational
organization
and
content
,
the
kind
distinctively
associated
with
consciousness
(Siewert
1998)
.


(See
the
entry
on
representational
theories
of
consciousness
.

)

Answering
the
What
question
requires
a
careful
account
of
the
coherent
---------------

Subjectivity
is
another
notion
sometimes
equated
with
the
qualitative
or
the
phenomenal
aspects
of
consciousness
in
the
literature
,
but
again
there
are
good
reason
to
recognize
it
,
at
least
in
some
of
its
forms
,
as
a
distinct
feature
of
consciousness—related
to
the
qualitative
and
the
phenomenal
but
different
from
each
.


In
particular
,
the
epistemic
form
of
subjectivity
concerns
apparent
limits
on
the
knowability
or
even
the
---------------
Whether
facts
about
experience
are
indeed
epistemically
limited
in
this
way
is
open
to
debate
(Lycan
1996)
,
but
the
claim
that
understanding
consciousness
requires
special
forms
of
knowing
and
access
from
the
inside
point
of
view
is
intuitively
plausible
and
has
a
long
history
(Locke
1688)
.


Thus
any
adequate
answer
to
the
What
question
must
address
the
epistemic
status
of
consciousness
,
both
our
abilities
to
understand
it
and
their
limits
(Papineau
2002
,
Chalmers
2003)
.

Self-perspectival
organization

The
perspectival
structure
of
consciousness
is
one
aspect
of
its
overall
phenomenal
organization
,
but
it
is
important
enough
to
merit
discussion
in
its
own
right
.


Insofar
as
the
key
perspective
is
that
of
the
---------------
constitute
a
unified
and
coherent
self
,
and
they
likely
differ
accordingly
in
the
sort
or
degree
of
perspectival
focus
they
embody
in
their
respective
forms
of
experience
(Lorenz
1977)
.


Consciousness
may
not
require
a
distinct
or
substantial
self
of
the
traditional
Cartesian
sort
,
but
at
least
some
degree
of
perspectivally
self-like
organization
---------------
Unity
is
closely
linked
with
the
self-perspective
,
but
it
merits
specific
mention
on
its
own
as
a
key
aspect
of
the
organization
of
consciousness
.


Conscious
systems
and
conscious
mental
states
both
involve
many
diverse
forms
of
unity
.


Some
are
causal
unities
associated
with
the
integration
of
action
and
control
into
a
unified
focus
of
---------------
experience
can
have
the
content
that
it
does
only
because
it
resides
within
that
larger
unified
structure
of
representation
.


(See
the
entry
on
unity
of
consciousness
.

)

Particular
attention
has
been
paid
recently
to
the
notion
of
phenomenal
---------------
and
dispositions
to
have
conscious
states
can
be
genuinely
intentional
,
but
most
theorists
regard
intentionality
as
extending
widely
into
the
unconscious
domain
.


(See
the
entry
on
consciousness
and
intentionality
.

)

One
potentially
important
dimension
of
difference
concerns
so
called
transparency
,
which
is
an
important
feature
of
consciousness
in
two
interrelated
metaphoric
senses
,
each
of
which
has
an
intentional
,
an
experiential
and
a
functional
aspect
.


---------------
green
grass
of
which
I
am
aware
not
of
any
green
property
of
my
visual
experience
.


(See
the
entry
on
representational
theories
of
consciousness
.

)
Moore
himself
believed
we
could
become
aware
of
those
latter
qualities
with
effort
and
redirection
of
attention
,
though
some
contemporary
transparency
advocates
deny
it
(Harman
1990
,
Tye
1995
,
Kind
---------------
to
‘think
right
through’
them
to
what
they
mean
or
represent
.


Transparency
in
this
semantic
sense
may
correspond
at
least
partly
with
what
John
Searle
calls
the
“intrinsic
intentionality”
of
consciousness
(Searle
1992)
.



---------------
to
accommodate
the
former
notion
within
a
more
externalist
account
of
content
and
meaning
.


Both
semantic
and
sensory
transparency
obviously
concern
the
representational
or
intentional
aspects
of
consciousness
,
but
they
are
also
experiential
aspects
of
our
conscious
life
.


They
are
part
of
what
it
'
s
like
or
how
it
feels
phenomenally
to
be
conscious
.

Dynamic
flow

The
dynamics
of
consciousness
are
evident
in
the
coherent
order
of
its
ever
changing
process
of
flow
and
self-transformation
,
what
William
James
(1890)
called
the
“stream
of
consciousness
.

”
Some
temporal
sequences
of
experience
are
generated
by
purely
internal
factors
as
when
one
thinks
through
a
puzzle
,
and
others
depend
in
part
upon
external
causes
as
when
one
chases
a
fly
ball
,
but
even
the
latter
sequences
are
shaped
in
large
part
by
how
consciousness
transforms
itself
.



Whether
partly
in
response
to
outer
influences
or
entirely
from
within
,
---------------
those
that
preceded
it
,
constrained
and
enabled
by
the
global
structure
of
links
and
limits
embodied
in
its
underlying
prior
organization
(Husserl
1913)
.


In
that
respect
,
consciousness
is
an
autopoietic
system
,
i
.

e
.


,
a
self-creating
and
self-organizing
system
(Varela
and
Maturana
1980)
.


---------------
intentional
properties
and
interconnected
contents
(Van
Gulick
2000)
.



Consciousness
is
a
dynamic
process
,
and
thus
an
adequate
descriptive
answer
to
the
What
question
must
deal
with
more
than
just
its
static
or
momentary
properties
.


In
particular
,
it
must
give
some
account
of
the
temporal
dynamics
of
consciousness
and
the
ways
in
which
its
self-transforming
flow
reflects
both
its
intentional
coherence
and
the
semantic
self-understanding
embodied
in
the
organized
controls
through
---------------
systems
engaged
with
their
worlds
.



A
comprehensive
descriptive
account
of
consciousness
would
need
to
deal
with
more
than
just
these
seven
features
,
but
having
a
clear
account
of
each
of
them
would
take
us
a
long
way
toward
answering
the
“What
is
consciousness
?

”
question
.



5
.


The
explanatory
question
:
How
can
consciousness
exist
?



The
How
question
focuses
on
explanation
rather
than
description
.


It
asks
us
to
explain
the
basic
status
of
consciousness
and
its
place
in
nature
.


Is
it
a
fundamental
feature
of
reality
in
its
own
right
,
or
does
its
existence
depend
upon
other
nonconscious
items
,
be
they
physical
,
biological
,
neural
or
computational
?


And
if
the
latter
,
can
we
explain
or
understand
how
the
relevant
nonconscious
items
could
cause
or
realize
consciousness
?


Put
simply
,
can
we
explain
how
to
make
something
conscious
out
of
things
that
are
not
conscious
?



---------------
The
How
question
is
not
a
single
question
,
but
rather
a
general
family
of
more
specific
questions
(Van
Gulick
1995)
.


They
all
concern
the
possibility
of
explaining
some
sort
or
aspect
of
consciousness
,
but
they
vary
in
their
particular
explananda
,
the
restrictions
on
their
explanans
,
and
their
criteria
for
successful
explanation
.


For
example
,
one
might
ask
whether
we
can
explain
access
consciousness
computationally
by
mimicking
the
requisite
access
relations
in
a
computational
model
.


Or
one
might
be
concerned
instead
with
whether
the
---------------

Explananda
.


Possible
explananda
would
include
the
various
sorts
of
state
and
creature
consciousness
distinguished
above
,
as
well
as
the
seven
features
of
consciousness
listed
in
response
to
the
What
question
.


Those
two
types
of
explananda
overlap
and
intersect
.


We
might
for
example
aim
to
explain
the
dynamic
aspect
either
of
phenomenal
or
of
access
consciousness
.


Or
we
could
try
to
explain
the
subjectivity
of
either
qualitative
or
meta-mental
consciousness
.


Not
every
feature
applies
to
every
sort
of
consciousness
,
but
all
apply
to
several
.


How
one
explains
a
given
feature
in
relation
to
one
sort
of
consciousness
may
not
correspond
with
what
is
needed
to
explain
it
relative
to
another
.



Explanans
.


The
range
of
possible
explanans
is
also
diverse
.


In
perhaps
its
broadest
form
,
the
How
question
asks
how
consciousness
of
the
relevant
sort
could
be
caused
or
realized
by
nonconscious
items
,
but
we
can
generate
a
wealth
of
more
specific
questions
by
further
restricting
the
range
of
the
relevant
explanans
.


One
might
seek
to
explain
how
a
given
feature
of
consciousness
is
caused
or
realized
by
underlying
neural
processes
,
biological
structures
,
physical
mechanisms
,
functional
or
teleofunctional
relations
,
computational
organization
,
or
even
by
---------------
vary
accordingly
.


In
general
the
more
limited
and
elementary
the
range
of
the
explanans
,
the
more
difficult
the
problem
of
explaining
how
could
it
suffice
to
produce
consciousness
(Van
Gulick
1995)
.



Criteria
of
explanation
.


The
third
key
parameter
is
how
one
defines
the
---------------
explanandum
be
a
priori
deducible
from
the
explanans
,
although
it
is
controversial
whether
this
is
either
a
necessary
or
a
sufficient
criterion
for
explaining
consciousness
(Jackson
1993)
.


Its
sufficiency
will
depend
in
part
on
the
nature
of
the
premises
from
which
the
deduction
proceeds
.


As
a
matter
of
logic
,
one
will
need
some
bridge
principles
to
connect
propositions
or
sentences
about
consciousness
with
those
that
do
not
mention
it
.


If
one
'
s
premises
concern
physical
or
neural
facts
,
then
one
will
need
some
bridge
principles
or
links
that
connect
such
facts
with
facts
about
consciousness
(Kim
1998)
.


Brute
links
,
whether
nomic
or
merely
well
confirmed
correlations
,
could
provide
a
logically
sufficient
bridge
to
infer
conclusions
about
consciousness
.


But
they
would
probably
not
allow
us
to
see
how
or
why
those
connections
hold
,
and
thus
they
would
fall
short
of
fully
explaining
how
consciousness
exists
(Levine
1983
,
1993
,
McGinn
1991)
.



One
could
legitimately
ask
for
more
,
in
particular
for
some
account
that
---------------
satisfy
the
conditions
for
the
liquidity
of
the
water
they
compose
.


Moreover
,
the
model
makes
intelligible
how
the
liquidity
is
produced
by
the
micro-properties
.


A
satisfactory
explanation
of
how
consciousness
is
produced
might
seem
to
require
a
similar
two
stage
story
.


Without
it
,
even
a
priori
deducibility
might
seem
explanatorily
less
than
---------------
sometimes
described
,
following
Joseph
Levine
(1983)
,
as
the
existence
of
an
explanatory
gap
,
and
as
indicating
our
incomplete
understanding
of
how
consciousness
might
depend
upon
a
nonconscious
substrate
,
especially
a
physical
substrate
.


The
basic
gap
claim
admits
of
many
variations
in
generality
and
thus
in
strength
.


---------------

If
one
could
see
on
a
priori
grounds
that
there
is
no
way
in
which
consciousness
could
be
intelligibly
explained
as
arising
from
the
physical
,
it
would
not
be
a
big
step
to
concluding
that
it
in
fact
does
not
do
so
(Chalmers
1996)
.


However
,
the
very
strength
of
such
an
---------------
support
,
such
as
the
alleged
conceivability
of
zombies
molecularly
identical
with
conscious
humans
but
devoid
of
all
phenomenal
consciousness
(Campbell
1970
,
Kirk
1974
,
Chalmers
1996)
.


Other
supporting
arguments
invoke
the
supposed
non-functional
nature
of
consciousness
and
thus
its
alleged
resistance
to
the
standard
scientific
method
of
explaining
complex
properties
(e
.

g
.


,
genetic
dominance)
in
terms
of
physically
realized
functional
conditions
(Block
1980a
,
---------------
properties
and
relations
might
be
underlain
by
physical
ones
.


Thus
one
might
opt
for
a
similar
criterion
for
interpreting
the
How
question
and
for
what
counts
as
explaining
how
consciousness
might
be
caused
or
realized
by
nonconscious
items
.


However
,
some
critics
,
such
as
Kim
(1987)
,
have
challenged
the
coherence
of
any
view
that
aims
to
be
both
---------------
replied
in
turn
(Van
Gulick
1993)
.



Others
have
argued
that
consciousness
is
especially
resistant
to
explanation
in
physical
terms
because
of
the
inherent
differences
between
our
subjective
and
objective
modes
of
understanding
.


Thomas
---------------

The
How
question
thus
subdivides
into
a
diverse
family
of
more
specific
questions
depending
upon
the
specific
sort
or
feature
of
consciousness
one
aims
to
explain
,
the
specific
restrictions
one
places
on
the
range
of
the
explanans
and
the
criterion
one
uses
to
define
explanatory
success
.


Some
of
the
resulting
variants
seem
easier
to
answer
than
others
.


Progress
may
seem
likely
on
some
of
the
so
called
“easy
problems”
of
consciousness
,
such
as
explaining
the
dynamics
of
access
consciousness
in
terms
of
the
functional
or
computational
organization
of
the
brain
(Baars
1988)
.


Others
may
seem
less
tractable
,
especially
the
so-called
“hard
problem”
(Chalmers
1995)
which
is
more
or
less
that
of
giving
an
intelligible
account
that
lets
us
see
in
an
intuitively
satisfying
way
how
phenomenal
or
“what
it
'
s
like”
consciousness
might
arise
from
physical
or
neural
processes
in
the
brain

hand

but
others
appear
to

baffling
.


Nor
should
we
assume
that
every
version
has
a
positive
answer
.


If
dualism
is
true
,
then
consciousness
in
at
least
some
of
its
types
may
be
basic
and
fundamental
.


If
so
,we
will
not
be
able
to
explain
how
it
arises
from
nonconscious
items
since
it
simply
does
not
do
so
.



One
'
s
view
of
the
prospects
for
explaining
consciousness
will
typically
depend
upon
one
'
s
perspective
.


Optimistic
physicalists
will
likely
see
current
explanatory
lapses
as
merely
the
reflection
of
the
early
stage
---------------
(Dennett
1991
,
Searle
1992
,
P
.


M
.

Churchland
1995)
.


To
dualists
,
those
same
impasses
will
signify
the
bankruptcy
of
the
physicalist
program
and
the
need
to
recognize
consciousness
as
a
fundamental
constituent
of
reality
in
its
own
right
(Robinson
1982
,
Foster
1989
,
1996
,
Chalmers
1996)
.


What
one
sees
depends
in
part
on
where
one
stands
,
and
the
ongoing
project
of
explaining
consciousness
will
be
accompanied
by
continuing
debate
about
its
status
and
prospects
for
success
.

The
functional
question
:
Why
does
consciousness
exist
?



The
functional
or
Why
question
asks
about
the
value
or
role
or
consciousness
and
thus
indirectly
about
its
origin
.


Does
it
have
a
function
,
and
if
so
what
is
it
?


Does
it
make
a
difference
to
the
operation
of
systems
in
which
it
is
present
,
and
if
so
why
and
how
?


If
consciousness
exists
as
a
complex
feature
of
biological
systems
,
then
its
adaptive
value
is
likely
relevant
to
explaining
its
evolutionary
origin
,
though
of
course
its
present
function
,
if
it
has
one
,
need
not
be
the
same
as
that
it
may
have
had
when
it
first
arose
.


Adaptive
functions
often
change
over
biological
time
.


Questions
about
the
value
of
consciousness
also
have
a
moral
dimension
in
at
least
two
ways
.


We
are
inclined
to
regard
an
organism
'
s
moral
status
as
at
least
partly
determined
by
the
nature
and
extent
to
which
it
is
conscious
,
and
---------------
As
with
the
What
and
How
questions
,
the
Why
question
poses
a
general
problem
that
subdivides
into
a
diversity
of
more
specific
inquiries
.


In
so
far
as
the
various
sorts
of
consciousness
,
e
.

g
.


,
access
,
phenomenal
,
meta-mental
,
are
distinct
and
separable—which
remains
an
open
question—they
likely
also
differ
in
their
specific
roles
and
values
.


Thus
the
Why
question
may
well
not
have
a
single
or
uniform
answer
.

1
Causal
status
of
consciousness

Perhaps
the
most
basic
issue
posed
by
any
version
of
the
Why
question
is
whether
or
not
consciousness
of
the
relevant
sort
has
any
causal
impact
at
all
.


If
it
has
no
effects
and
makes
no
causal
difference
whatsoever
,
then
it
would
seem
unable
to
play
any
significant
role
in
the
systems
or
---------------
inquiries
about
its
possible
value
.


Nor
can
the
threat
of
epiphenomenal
irrelevance
be
simply
dismissed
as
an
obvious
non-option
,
since
at
least
some
forms
of
consciousness
have
been
seriously
alleged
in
the
recent
literature
to
lack
causal
status
.


(See
the
entry
on
epiphenomenalism
.

)
Such
worries
have
been
raised
especially
with
regard
to
qualia
and
qualitative
consciousness
(Huxley
1874
,
Jackson
1982
,
Chalmers
1996)
,
but
challenges
have
also
been
leveled
against
the
causal
status
of
other
sorts
including
meta-mental
consciousness
(Velmans
1991)
.



Both
metaphysical
and
empirical
arguments
have
been
given
in
support
of
---------------
whose
behavior
,
functional
organization
,
and
physical
structure
down
to
the
molecular
level
are
identical
to
those
of
normal
human
agents
but
who
lack
any
qualia
or
qualitative
consciousness
.


Some
(Kirk
1970
,
Chalmers
1996)
assert
such
beings
are
possible
in
worlds
that
share
all
our
physical
laws
,
but
others
deny
it
(Dennett
1991
,
Levine
2001)
.


If
---------------

Arguments
of
a
far
more
empirical
sort
have
challenged
the
causal
status
of
meta-mental
consciousness
,
at
least
in
so
far
as
its
presence
can
be
measured
by
the
ability
to
report
on
one
'
s
mental
state
.


Scientific
evidence
is
claimed
to
show
that
consciousness
of
that
sort
is
neither
necessary
for
any
type
of
mental
ability
nor
does
it
occur
early
enough
to
act
as
a
cause
of
the
acts
or
processes
typically
thought
to
be
its
effects
(Velmans
1991)
.


According
to
those
who
make
such
arguments
,
the
sorts
of
mental
abilities
that
are
typically
thought
to
require
consciousness
can
all
be
realized
unconsciously
in
the
absence
of
the
supposedly
required
self-awareness
.



---------------
occurs
too
late
to
be
the
cause
of
the
relevant
actions
rather
than
their
result
or
at
best
a
joint
effect
of
some
shared
prior
cause
(Libet
1985)
.


Self-awareness
or
meta-mental
consciousness
according
to
these
arguments
turns
out
to
be
a
psychological
after-effect
rather
than
an
initiating
cause
,
more
like
a
post
facto
printout
or
the
result
---------------
Flanagan
1992
,
and
commentaries
accompanying
Velmans
1991)
.


Though
the
empirical
arguments
,
like
the
zombie
claims
,
require
one
to
consider
seriously
whether
some
forms
of
consciousness
may
be
less
causally
potent
than
is
typically
assumed
,
many
theorists
regard
the
empirical
data
as
no
real
threat
to
the
causal
status
of
consciousness
.



If
the
epiphenomenalists
are
wrong
and
consciousness
,
in
its
various
forms
,
is
indeed
causal
,
what
sorts
of
effects
does
it
have
and
what
differences
does
it
make
?


How
do
mental
processes
that
involve
the
relevant
sort
of
consciousness
differ
form
those
that
lack
it
?


What
function(s)
might
consciousness
play
?


The
following
six
sections
(6
.

2–6
.

7)
discuss
some
of
the
more
commonly
given
answers
.


Though
the
various
functions
overlap
to
some
degree
,
each
is
distinct
,
and
they
differ
as
well
in
the
sorts
of
consciousness
with
which
each
is
most
aptly
linked
.



---------------
automatic
unconscious
mental
operations
(Anderson
1983)
.


The
relevant
increases
in
flexibility
would
seem
most
closely
connected
with
the
meta-mental
or
higher-order
form
of
consciousness
in
so
far
as
the
enhanced
ability
to
control
processes
depends
upon
greater
self-awareness
.


However
,
flexibility
and
sophisticated
modes
of
control
may
be
associated
as
well
with
the
phenomenal
and
access
forms
of
consciousness
.

Social
coordination

Enhanced
capacity
for
social
coordination
.


Consciousness
of
the
meta-mental
sort
may
well
involve
not
only
an
increase
in
self-awareness
but
also
an
enhanced
understanding
of
the
mental
states
of
other
minded
---------------
This
increase
in
mutually
shared
knowledge
of
each
other
'
s
minds
,
enables
the
relevant
organisms
to
interact
,
cooperate
and
communicate
in
more
advanced
and
adaptive
ways
.


Although
meta-mental
consciousness
is
the
sort
most
obviously
linked
to
such
a
socially
coordinative
role
,
narrative
consciousness
of
the
kind
associated
with
the
stream
of
consciousness
is
also
clearly
relevant
in
so
far
as
it
involves
the
application
to
one
'
s
own
case
of
the
interpretative
abilities
that
derive
in
part
from
their
social
application
(Ryle
1949
,
Dennett
1978
,
---------------
conscious
experience
.


The
unity
of
experienced
space
is
just
one
example
of
the
sort
of
integration
associated
with
our
conscious
awareness
of
an
objective
world
.


(See
the
entry
on
unity
of
consciousness
.

)

This
integrative
role
or
value
is
most
directly
associated
with
access
consciousness
,
but
also
clearly
with
the
larger
phenomenal
and
intentional
structure
of
experience
.


It
is
relevant
even
to
the
qualitative
aspect
of
consciousness
in
so
far
as
qualia
play
an
important
role
in
our
experience
of
unified
objects
in
a
unified
space
or
scene
.


It
is
intimately
tied
as
well
to
the
transparency
of
---------------
semantic
transparency
(Van
Gulick
1993)
.


Integration
of
information
plays
a
major
role
in
several
current
neuro-cognitive
theories
of
consciousness

Global
Workspace
theories
(see

9
.

5)
and
Giulio
Tononi
'
s
Integrated
Information
theory
(section
9
.

below)
.



---------------

This
particular
role
is
most
directly
and
definitionally
tied
to
the
notion
of
access
consciousness
(Block
1995)
,
but
meta-mental
consciousness
as
well
as
the
phenomenal
and
qualitative
forms
all
seem
plausibly
linked
to
such
increases
in
the
availability
of
information
(Armstrong
1981
,
Tye
1985)
.


Diverse
cognitive
and
neuro-cognitive
theories
incorporate
access
as
a
central
feature
of
consciousness
and
conscious
processing

(See
the
entry
on
free
will
.

)
The
notion
of
free
will
may
itself
remain
too
murky
and
contentious
to
shed
any
clear
light
on
the
role
of
consciousness
,
but
there
is
a
traditional
intuition
that
the
two
are
deeply
linked
.



Consciousness
has
been
thought
to
open
a
realm
of
possibilities
,
a
sphere
of
options
within
which
the
conscious
self
might
choose
or
act
freely
.


At
a
minimum
,
consciousness
might
seem
a
necessary
precondition
for
any
such
freedom
or
self-determination
(Hasker
1999)
.


How
could
one
engage
in
the
requisite
sort
of
free
choice
,
while
remaining
solely
---------------
own
nature
and
future
development
may
admit
of
many
interesting
variations
and
degrees
rather
than
being
a
simple
all
or
nothing
matter
,
and
various
forms
or
levels
of
consciousness
might
be
correlated
with
corresponding
degrees
or
types
of
freedom
and
self-determination
(Dennett
1984
,
2003)
.


The
link
with
freedom
seems
strongest
for
the
meta-mental
form
of
consciousness
given
its
emphasis
on
self-awareness
,
but
potential
connections
also
seem
possible
for
most
of
the
other
sorts
as
well
.


---------------
appearance
of
intrinsic
and
directly
experienced
motivational
force
is
illusory
.


But
if
it
is
real
,
then
it
may
be
one
of
the
most
important
and
evolutionarily
oldest
respects
in
which
consciousness
makes
a
difference
to
the
mental
systems
and
processes
in
which
it
is
present
(Humphreys
1992)
.



Other
suggestions
have
been
made
about
the
possible
roles
and
value
of
consciousness
,
and
these
six
surely
do
not
exhaust
the
options
.


Nonetheless
,
they
are
among
the
most
prominent
recent
hypotheses
,
and
they
provide
a
fair
survey
of
the
sorts
of
answers
that
have
been
offered
to
the
Why
question
by
those
who
believe
consciousness
does
indeed
make
a
difference
.



---------------
of
contingent
realization
.


In
the
former
,
fulfilling
the
role
constitutes
being
conscious
in
the
relevant
sense
,
while
in
the
latter
case
consciousness
of
a
given
sort
is
just
one
way
among
several
in
which
the
requisite
role
might
be
realized
(Van
Gulick
1993)
.



---------------
variety
of
subsystems
and
behavioral
applications
may
constitute
its
being
conscious
in
the
access
sense
.


By
contrast
,
even
if
the
qualitative
and
phenomenal
forms
of
consciousness
involve
a
highly
unified
and
densely
integrated
representation
of
objective
reality
,
it
may
be
possible
to
produce
representations
having
those
functional
---------------
that
happened
to
arise
in
our
evolutionary
ancestry
.


If
so
,
there
may
be
quite
other
means
of
achieving
a
comparable
result
without
qualitative
or
phenomenal
consciousness
.


Whether
this
is
the
right
way
to
think
about
phenomenal
and
qualitative
conscious
is
unclear
;
perhaps
the
tie
to
unified
and
densely
integrated
representation
is
in
fact
as
intimate
and
constitutive
as
it
seems
to
be
in
the
case
of
access
consciousness
(Carruthers
2000)
.


Regardless
of
how
that
issue
gets
resolved
,
it
is
important
to
not
to
conflate
constitution
accounts
with
contingent
realization
accounts
when
addressing
the
function
of
consciousness
and
answering
the
question
of
why
it
exists
(Chalmers
1996)
.

Theories
of
consciousness

In
response
to
the
What
,
How
and
Why
questions
many
theories
of
consciousness
have
been
proposed
in
recent
years
.


However
,
not
all
theories
of
consciousness
are
theories
of
the
same
thing
.


They
vary
not
only
in
the
specific
sorts
of
consciousness
they
take
as
their
object
,
but
also
in
their
theoretical
aims
.



Perhaps
the
largest
division
is
between
general
metaphysical
theories
that
aim
to
locate
consciousness
in
the
overall
ontological
scheme
of
reality
and
more
specific
theories
that
offer
detailed
accounts
of
its
nature
,
features
and
role
.

line
between
the
two
sorts
of
theories

Dualist
theories

Dualist
theories
regard
at
least
some
aspects
of
consciousness
as
falling
outside
the
realm
of
the
physical
,but
specific
forms
of
dualism
differ
in
just
which
aspects
those
are

)

,
asserts
the
existence
of
both
physical
and
non-physical
substances
.


Such
theories
entail
the
existence
of
non-physical
minds
or
selves
as
entities
in
which
consciousness
inheres
.


Though
substance
dualism
is
at
present
largely
out
of
favor
,
it
does
have
some
contemporary
proponents
(Swinburne
1986
,
Foster
1989
,
1996)
.


---------------
1996)
according
to
which
the
proto-mental
aspects
of
micro-constituents
can
give
rise
under
suitable
conditions
of
combination
to
full
blown
consciousness
.


(See
the
entry
on
panpsychism
.

)

The
nature
of
the
relevant
proto-psychic
aspect
remains
unclear
,
and
---------------
properties
do
not
involve
any
such
feel
,
it
is
not
clear
how
they
are
any
better
able
than
physical
properties
to
account
for
qualitative
consciousness
in
solving
the
Hard
Problem
.



A
more
modest
form
of
panpsychism
has
been
advocated
by
the
neuroscientist
Giulio
Tononi
(2008)
and
endorsed
by
other
neuroscientists
including
Christof
Koch
(2012)
.


This
version
derives
from
Tononi
'
s
integrated
information
theory
(IIT)
of
consciousness
that
identifies
consciousness
with
integrated
information
which
can
exist
in
many
degrees
(see
section
9
.

6
below)
.


According
to
IIT
,
even
a
simple
indicator
device
such
as
a
single
photo
diode
possesses
some
degree
of
integrated
information
and
thus
some
limited
degree
of
consciousness
,
a
consequence
which
both
Tononi
and
Koch
embrace
as
a
form
of
panpsychism
.



A
variety
of
arguments
have
been
given
in
favor
of
dualist
and
other
anti-physicalist
theories
of
consciousness
.


Some
are
largelya
priori
in
nature
such
as
those
that
appeal
to
the
supposed
conceivability
of
zombies
(Kirk
1970
,
Chalmers
1996)
or
versions
of
the
knowledge
argument
(Jackson
1982
,
1986)
which
aim
to
reach
an
anti-physicalist
conclusion
about
the
ontology
of
consciousness
from
the
apparent
limits
on
our
ability
to
fully
understand
the
qualitative
aspects
of
conscious
experience
through
third-person
physical
accounts
of
the

2
Physicalist
theories

Most
other
metaphysical
theories
of
consciousness
are
versions
of
physicalism
of
one
familiar
sort
or
another
.



Eliminativist
theories
reductively
deny
the
existence
of
consciousness
or
at
least
the
existence
of
some
of
its
commonly
accepted
sorts
or
features
.


(See
the
entry
on
eliminative
materialism
.

)
The
radical
eliminativists
reject
the
very
notion
of
consciousness
as
muddled
or
wrong
headed
and
claim
that
the
conscious/nonconscious
distinction
fails
to
cut
mental
reality
at
its
joints
(Wilkes
1984
,
1988)
.


They
regard
the
idea
of
consciousness
as
sufficiently
off
target
to
merit
elimination

More
modest
eliminativists
,
like

,
thus
typically
combine
their
qualified
denials
with
a
positive
theory
of

to
dissolve
the
explanatory
gap
problem
.



Most
physicalist
theories
of
consciousness
are
neither
eliminativist
nor
based
on
strict
type-type
identities
.


They
acknowledge
the
reality
of
consciousness
but
aim
to
locate
it
within
the
physical
world
on
the
basis
of
some
psycho-physical
relation
short
of
strict
property
identity
.


---------------

Functionalist
theories
in
particular
rely
heavily
on
the
notion
of
realization
to
explicate
the
relation
between
consciousness
and
the
physical
.


According
to
functionalism
,
a
state
or
process
counts
as
being
of
a
given
mental
or
conscious
type
in
virtue
of
the
functional
role
it
---------------
at
an
underlying
level
.



Critics
of
functionalism
often
deny
that
consciousness
can
be
adequately
explicated
in
functional
terms
(Block
1980a
,
1980b
,
Levine
1983
,
Chalmers
1996)
.


According
to
such
critics
,
consciousness
may
have
interesting
functional
characteristics
but
its
nature
is
not
essentially
functional
.


Such
claims
are
sometimes
supported
by
appeal
to

Specific
Theories
of
Consciousness

Although
there
are
many
general
metaphysical/ontological
theories
of
consciousness
,
the
list
of
specific
detailed
theories
about
its
nature
is
even
longer
and
more
diverse
.


No
brief
survey
could
be
close
to
comprehensive
,
but
seven
main
types
of
theories
may
help
to
indicate
the
---------------
unconscious
consists
in
the
fact
that
we
are
not
reflexively
and
directly
aware
of
being
in
them
.


(See
the
entry
on
higher-order
theories
of
consciousness
.

)

Higher-order
theories
come
in
two
main
variants
that
differ
concerning
---------------

The
higher-order
view
is
most
obviously
relevant
to
the
meta-mental
forms
of
consciousness
,
but
some
of
its
supporters
take
it
to
explain
other
types
of
consciousness
as
well
,
including
the
more
subjective
what
it
'
s
like
and
qualitative
types
.


One
common
strategy
is
to
analyze
qualia
as
mental
features
that
are
capable
of
occurring
unconsciously
;
---------------
(Papineau
2002)
.


Whether
or
not
such
proposed
HO
accounts
of
qualia
are
successful
,
it
is
important
to
note
that
most
HO
advocates
take
themselves
to
be
offering
a
comprehensive
theory
of
consciousness
,
or
at
least
the
core
of
such
a
general
theory
,
rather
than
merely
one
limited
to
some
special
meta-mental
forms
of
it
.



Other
variants
of
HO
theory
go
beyond
the
standard
HOT
and
HOP
versions
including
some
that
analyze
consciousness
in
terms
of
dispositional
rather
than
occurrent
higher-order
thoughts
(Carruthers
2000)
.


Others
appeal
to
implicit
rather
than
explicit
higher-order
understanding
and
---------------

Reflexive
theories
,
like
higher-order
theories
,
imply
a
strong
link
between
consciousness
and
self-awareness
.


They
differ
in
that
they
locate
the
aspect
of
self-awareness
directly
within
the
conscious
state
itself
rather
than
in
a
distinct
meta-state
directed
at
it
.


The
idea
---------------
(Gennaro
2004
,
2012)
while
others
reject
the
higher-order
category
and
describe
their
theories
as
presenting
a
“same-order”
account
of
consciousness
as
self-awareness
(Kriegel
2009)
.


Yet
others
challenge
the
level
distinction
by
analyzing
the
meta-intentional
content
as
implicit
in
the
phenomenal
first-order
content
of
conscious
states
,
as
in
so
---------------

3
Representationalist
theories

Almost
all
theories
of
consciousness
regard
it
as
having
representational
features
,
but
so
called
representationalist
theories
are
defined
by
the
stronger
view
that
its
representational
features
---------------
obvious
targets
for
such
elimination
.


Indeed
part
of
the
motivation
for
representationalism
is
to
show
that
one
can
accommodate
all
the
facts
about
consciousness
,
perhaps
within
a
physicalist
framework
,
without
needing
to
find
room
for
qualia
or
any
other
apparently
non-representational
mental
properties
(Dennett
1990
,
Lycan
1996
,

.

Narrative
Interpretative
Theories

Some
theories
of
consciousness
stress
the
interpretative
nature
of
facts
about
consciousness
.


According
to
such
views
,
what
is
or
is
not
conscious
is
not
always
a
determinate
fact
,
or
at
least
not
so
independent
of
a
larger
context
of
interpretative
judgments
.


The
most
prominent
philosophical
example
is
the
Multiple
Drafts
Model
(MDM)
of
consciousness
,
advanced
by
Daniel
Dennett
(1991)
.


It
combines
elements
of
both
representationalism
and
higher-order
theory
but
does
so
in
a
way
that
varies
interestingly
from
the
more
standard
versions
of
either
providing
a
more
interpretational
and
less
strongly
realist
view
of
consciousness
.



The
MDM
includes
many
distinct
but
interrelated
features
.


Its
name
---------------
“multiple”
of
the
Multiple
Drafts
Model
.



The
MDM
is
representationalist
in
that
it
analyzes
consciousness
in
terms
of
content
relations
.


It
also
denies
the
existence
of
qualia
and
thus
rejects
any
attempt
to
distinguish
conscious
states
from
---------------
Dennett
'
s
MDM
has
been
highly
influential
but
has
also
drawn
criticism
,
especially
from
those
who
find
it
insufficiently
realist
in
its
view
of
consciousness
and
at
best
incomplete
in
achieving
its
stated
goal
to
fully
explain
it
(Block
1994
,
Dretske
1994
,
Levine
1994)
.


Many
of
its
critics
acknowledge
the
insight
and
value
of
the
MDM
,
but
deny
that
there
are
no
real
facts
of
consciousness
other
than
those
captured
by
it
(Rosenthal
1994
,
Van
Gulick
1994
,
Akins
1996)

that
makes
sense
of
our
actions
in
any
inferential
way
and
constructs
an
ongoing
narrative
of
our
actions
and
experience
.


Though
the
theory
is
not
intended
as
a
complete
theory
of
consciousness
,
it
accords
a
major
role
to
such
interpretative
narrative
activity
.

5
Cognitive
Theories

A
number
theories
of
consciousness
associate
it
with
a
distinct
cognitive
architecture
or
with
a
special
pattern
of
activity
with
that
structure
.


---------------
Global
Workspace
.


A
major
psychological
example
of
the
cognitive
approach
is
the
Global
Workspace
theory
.


As
initially
developed
by
Bernard
Baars
(1988))
global
workspace
theory
describes
consciousness
in
terms
of
a
competition
among
processors
and
outputs
for
a
limited
capacity
resource
that
“broadcasts”
information
for
widespread
access
---------------
The
model
has
been
further
developed
with
proposed
connections
to
particular
neural
and
functional
brain
systems
by
Stanislas
Dehaene
and
others
(2000)
.


Of
special
importance
is
the
claim
that
consciousness
in
both
the
access
and
phenomenal
sense
occurs
when
and
only
when
the
relevant
content
enters
the
larger
global
network
involving
both
primary
---------------

The
integration
of
information
from
many
sources
is
an
important
feature
of
consciousness
and
,
as
noted
above
(section
6
.

4)
,
is
often
cited
as
one
of
its
major
functions
.


Content
integration
plays
an
important
role
in
various
theories
especially
global
workspace
theory
(section
9
.

3)
.


However
,
a
proposal
by
the
neuroscientist
Giulio
Tononi
(2008)
goes
further
in
identifying
consciousness
with
integrated
information
and
asserting
that
information
integration
of
the
relevant
sort
is
both
necessary
and
sufficient
for
consciousness
regardless
of
the
substrate
in
which
it
is
realized
(which
need
not
be
neural
or
biological)
.


According
to
Tononi
'
s
Integrated
Information
Theory
(IIT)
,
consciousness
is
a
purely
information-theoretic
property
of
systems
.


He
proposes
a
mathematical
measure
φ
that
aims
to
measure
not
merely
the
information
---------------
highest
φ
value
will
be
conscious
according
to
IIT
.



According
to
IIT
,
consciousness
varies
in
quantity
and
comes
in
many
degrees
which
correspond
to
φ
values
.


Thus
even
a
simple
system
such
a
single
photo
diode
will
be
conscious
to
some
degree
if
it
is
not
contained
within
a
larger
complex
.


In
that
sense
,
IIT
implies
a
form
of
panpsychism
that
Tononi
explicitly
endorses
.


According
to
IIT
,
the
quality
of
the
relevant
consciousness
is
determined
by
the
totality
of
informational
relations
within
the
relevant
integrated
complex
.


Thus
IIT
aims
to
explain
both
the
quantity
and
quality
of
phenomenal
consciousness
.


Other
neuroscientists
,
notably
Christof
Koch
,
have
also
endorsed
the
IIT
approach
(Koch
2012)
.

7
Neural
Theories

Neural
theories
of
consciousness
come
in
many
forms
,
though
most
in
some
way
concern
the
so
called
“neural
correlates
of
consciousness”
or
NCCs
.


Unless
one
is
a
dualist
or
other
non-physicalist
,
more
than
mere
correlation
is
required
;
at
least
some
NCCs
must
be
the
essential
substrates
of
consciousness
.


An
explanatory
neural
theory
needs
to
explain
why
or
how
the
relevant
correlations
exist
,
and
if
the
theory
is
committed
to
physicalism
that
will
require
showing
how
the
underlying
---------------

Such
theories
are
diverse
not
only
in
the
neural
processes
or
properties
to
which
they
appeal
but
also
in
the
aspects
of
consciousness
they
take
as
their
respective
explananda
.


Some
are
based
on
high-level
systemic
features
of
the
brain
,
but
others
focus
on
more
specific
physiological
or
structural
properties
,
with
corresponding
differences
in
their
intended
explanatory
targets
.


Most
in
some
way
aim
to
connect
with
theories
of
consciousness
at
other
levels
of
description
such
as
cognitive
,
representational
or
higher-order
theories
.



---------------
In
each
case
the
aim
is
to
explain
how
organization
and
activity
at
the
relevant
neural
level
could
underlie
one
or
another
major
type
or
feature
of
consciousness
.


Global
fields
or
transient
synchronous
assemblies
could
underlie
the
intentional
unity
of
phenomenal
consciousness
.


NMDA-based
plasticity
,
specific
thalamic
projections
into
the
cortex
,
or
regular
oscillatory
waves
could
all
contribute
to
the
formation
of
short
term
but
widespread
neural
patterns
or
regularities
---------------
One
particular
recent
controversy
has
concerned
the
issue
of
whether
global
or
merely
local
recurrent
activity
is
sufficient
for
phenomenal
consciousness
.


Supporters
of
the
global
neuronal
workspace
model
(Dehaene
2000)
have
argued
that
consciousness
of
any
sort
can
occur
only
when
contents
are
activated
with
a
large
scale
pattern
of
recurrent
activity
involving
frontal
and
parietal
areas
as
well
as
primary
sensory
---------------
(2006)
and
the
philosopher
Ned
Block
(2007)
have
argued
that
local
recurrent
activity
between
higher
and
lower
areas
within
sensory
cortex
(e
.

g
.


with
visual
cortex)
can
suffice
for
phenomenal
consciousness
even
in
the
absence
of
verbal
reportability
and
other
indicators
of
access
consciousness
.

Quantum
theories

Other
physical
theories
have
gone
beyond
the
neural
and
placed
the
natural
locus
of
consciousness
at
a
far
more
fundamental
level
,
in
particular
at
the
micro-physical
level
of
quantum
phenomena
.


According
to
such
theories
,
the
nature
and
basis
of
consciousness
can
not
be
adequately
understood
within
the
framework
of
classical
physics
but
must
be
sought
within
the
alternative
picture
of
physical
reality
provided
by
quantum
mechanics
.


The
proponents
of
the
quantum
consciousness
approach
regard
the
radically
alternative
and
often
counterintuitive
nature
of
quantum
physics
as
just
what
is
needed
to
overcome
the
supposed
---------------
Again
there
are
a
wide
range
of
specific
theories
and
models
that
have
been
proposed
,
appealing
to
a
variety
of
quantum
phenomena
to
explain
a
diversity
of
features
of
consciousness
.


It
would
be
impossible
to
catalog
them
here
or
even
explain
in
any
substantial
way
the
key
features
of
quantum
mechanics
to
which
they
appeal
.


However
,
a
brief
---------------

The
physicist
Roger
Penrose
(1989
,
1994)
and
the
anesthesiologist
Stuart
Hameroff
(1998)
have
championed
a
model
according
to
which
consciousness
arises
through
quantum
effects
occurring
within
subcellular
structures
internal
to
neurons
known
as
microtubules
.


The
model
posits
so
called
---------------

The
psychiatrist
Ian
Marshall
has
offered
a
model
that
aims
to
explain
the
coherent
unity
of
consciousness
by
appeal
to
the
production
within
the
brain
of
a
physical
state
akin
to
that
of
a
Bose-Einstein
condensate
.


The
latter
is
a
quantum
phenomenon
in
which
a
collection
of
---------------
similar
coherence
(Marshall
and
Zohar
1990)
.



A
basis
for
consciousness
has
also
been
sought
in
the
holistic
nature
of
quantum
mechanics
and
the
phenomenon
of
entanglement
,
according
to
which
particles
that
have
interacted
continue
to
have
their
natures
depend
upon
each
other
even
after
their
separation
.


Unsurprisingly
these
models
have
been
targeted
especially
at
explaining
the
coherence
of
consciousness
,
but
they
have
also
been
invoked
as
a
more
general
challenge
to
the
atomistic
conception
of
traditional
physics
according
to
which
the
properties
of
wholes
are
to
be
explained
by
appeal
to
the
properties
of
their
parts
plus
their
mode
of
combination
,
a
method
of
explanation
that
might
be
regarded
as
unsuccessful
to
date
in
explaining
consciousness
(Silberstein
1998
,
2001)
.



Others
have
taken
quantum
mechanics
to
indicate
that
consciousness
is
an
absolutely
fundamental
property
of
physical
reality
,
one
that
needs
to
be
brought
in
at
the
very
most
basic
level
(Stapp
1993)
.


They
have
---------------
upon
its
being
consciously
observed
.



There
are
many
other
quantum
models
of
consciousness
to
be
found
in
the
literature—some
advocating
a
radically
revisionist
metaphysics
and
others
not—but
these
four
provide
a
reasonable
,
though
partial
,
sample
---------------
9
.

9
Non-physical
theories

Most
specific
theories
of
consciousness—whether
cognitive
,
neural
or
quantum
mechanical—aim
to
explain
or
model
consciousness
as
a
natural
feature
of
the
physical
world
.


However
,
those
who
reject
a
physicalist
ontology
of
consciousness
must
find
ways
of
modeling
it
as
a
nonphysical
aspect
of
reality
.


Thus
those
who
adopt
a
dualist
or
anti-physicalist
metaphysical
view
must
in
the
end
provide
specific
models
of
consciousness
different
from
the
five
types
above
.


Both
substance
dualists
and
property
dualists
must
develop
the
details
of
their
theories
in
ways
that
articulate
the
specific
natures
of
the
relevant
non-physical
features
of
reality
with
which
they
equate
consciousness
or
to
which
they
appeal
in
order
to
explain
it
.



---------------
the
physical
as
itself
derived
from
the
informational
(a
version
of
“it
from
bit”
theory)
.


In
a
somewhat
similar
vein
,
Gregg
Rosenberg
has
(2004)
proposed
an
account
of
consciousness
that
simultaneously
addresses
the
ultimate
categorical
basis
of
causal
relations
.


In
both
the
causal
case
and
the
conscious
case
,
Rosenberg
argues
the
---------------
relations
and
qualitative
phenomenal
facts
both
depend
upon
the
same
base
.


Also
,
as
noted
just
above
(section
9
.

8)
,
some
quantum
theories
treat
consciousness
as
a
fundamental
feature
of
reality
(Stapp
1993)
,
and
insofar
as
they
do
so
,
they
might
be
plausibly
classified
as
non-physical
theories
as
well
.


---------------

Conclusion

A
comprehensive
understanding
of
consciousness
will
likely
require
theories
of
many
types
.


One
might
usefully
and
without
contradiction
accept
a
diversity
of
models
that
each
in
their
own
way
aim
respectively
to
explain
the
physical
,
neural
,
cognitive
,
functional
,
representational
and
higher-order
aspects
of
consciousness
.


There
is
unlikely
to
be
any
single
theoretical
perspective
that
suffices
for
explaining
all
the
features
of
consciousness
that
we
wish
to
understand
.


Thus
a
synthetic
and
pluralistic
approach
may
provide
the
best
road
to
future
progress
.
