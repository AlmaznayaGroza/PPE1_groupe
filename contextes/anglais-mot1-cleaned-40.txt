,

What
is
“conscience”
?


It’s
a
word
we’re
all
familiar
with—a
clear
conscience
,
a
guilty
conscience—even
if
we
can’t
pinpoint
an
exact
definition
.



The
concept
pops
up
in
all
kinds
of
places
.


In
Saturday
morning
cartoons
where
good
guys
consult
an
angel
on
their
right
shoulder
(conscience)
and
a
devil
on
their
left
shoulder
(temptation)
before
making
a
decision
.


In
literary
masterpieces
like
Crime
and
Punishment
,
where
the
---------------
final
good
act
after
a
lifetime
of
evil
.



But
none
of
these
examples
capture
the
full
concept
of
conscience
.


As
Americans
,
we
should
consider
the
true
meaning
of
“conscience
.

”
We
should
also
recognize
the
importance—and
privilege—of
having
the
freedom
of
conscience
.


America
was
founded
on
this
freedom
.


And
it’s
worth
preserving
today
.



Read
on
to
find
out
why
.



What
is
freedom
of
conscience
?



Conscience
is
our
God-given
ability
to
discern
right
from
wrong
,
good
from
evil
.


But
it’s
more
than
that
.


For
knowing
right
from
wrong
wouldn’t
do
much
good
if
we
didn’t
(or
couldn’t)
act
on
what’s
right
.


So
conscience
also
includes
the
ability
to
apply
laws
,
rules
,
and
intuitions
in
the
right
way
.


In
other
words
,
to
act
on
what
we
believe
.



---------------
action
by
serving
others
.



Where
is
freedom
of
conscience
found
in
the
Constitution
?



America’s
Founders
understood
the
gravity
of
protecting
the
freedom
of
conscience
.



James
Madison
called
conscience
“the
most
sacred
of
all
property
.

”
Thomas
Jefferson
said
that
no
“provision
in
our
constitution
ought
to
be
dearer
to
man
,
than
that
which
protects
the
rights
of
conscience
against”
the
government
.


And
during
the
debate
over
what
would
become
the
First
Amendment
,
many
lawmakers
proposed
protecting
the
rights
of
conscience
.



This
understanding
shaped
the
First
Amendment
.


Although
the
amendment
doesn’t
explicitly
mention
“conscience
,”
it
protects
its
animating
features
:
religious
freedom
and
free
speech
.


The
First
Amendment
says
,
“Congress
shall
make
no
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion
,
or
---------------
speech
,
or
of
the
press
.

”

Why
is
freedom
of
conscience
important
?



These
26
words
protect
the
freedom
of
conscience—the
freedom
to
believe
without
coercion
and
to
speak
and
act
consistently
with
those
beliefs
.



---------------
things
to
which
we
object
.


So
we
have
the
freedom
to
think
,
reason
,
speak
,
stay
silent
about
,
and
hold
certain
beliefs
without
fearing
government
punishment
.


That
protects
our
private
conscience
.



But
our
internal
beliefs
often
move
us
to
act
publicly
.


So
the
First
---------------

The
freedom
to
act
on
our
beliefs
is
important
because
community
standards—or
lack
thereof—reflect
individuals’
conscience
.


The
more
we
train
our
conscience
to
do
what
is
right
,
the
better
off
we
will
be
.


But
we
lose
our
ability
to
discern
right
from
wrong
the
more
we
consistently
ignore
our
conscience
.



The
freedom
of
conscience
has
also
benefitted
America’s
common
good
.


Because
of
this
freedom
,
religious
organizations
have
founded
and
currently
operate
countless
hospitals
,
homeless
shelters
,
adoption

Court
.



What
are
some
court
cases
dealing
with
freedom
of
conscience
?



The
freedom
of
conscience
is
worth
preserving
.


Several
court
cases
seek
to
do
(and
have
done)
just
that
.


Consider
three
contexts
:

---------------

2
.


The
freedom
of
medical
providers
to
decline
to
provide
medical
procedures
that
violate
their
conscience
.



3
.


The
freedom
of
faith-based
public-service
ministries
to
operate
in
line
with
their
religious
purpose
.



Freedom
of
conscience
for
artists

For
almost
eighty
years
,
the
U
.

S
.


Supreme
Court
has
recognized
that
---------------
its
laws
to
force
her
to
create
websites
promoting
messages
that
contradict
her
beliefs
about
marriage
.


Unwilling
to
violate
the
law
or
her
conscience
,
Lorie
challenged
the
law
to
protect
the
cherished
freedom
to
speak
consistently
with
her
religious
views
on
marriage
.

 

---------------
consistent
with
his
belief
about
the
immutability
of
sex
.


Lorie’s
victory
reaffirms
that
the
Supreme
Court
still
believes
in
the
importance
of
a
free
conscience
.


That’s
how
it
should
be
.


Every
American
has
the
right
to
speak
freely
.


That’s
why
Lorie
found
support
from
a
diverse
group
of
artists—from
a
world-renowned
graphic
designer
to
a
---------------
artist
who
hold
different
views
about
marriage
.



Freedom
of
conscience
for
health-care
professionals

Beyond
speech
,
the
freedom
of
conscience
is
imperative
in
the
medical
field
.


Since
ancient
times
,
physicians
have
sworn
to
“do
no
harm”
to
their
patients
.


Fast
forward
to
present
day
,
and
professional
medical
ethics
acknowledge
the
rights
of
professionals
to
decline
to
provide
medical
treatment
that
violates
their
conscience
.



The
justification
echoes
the
First
Amendment—to
preserve
the
personal
---------------
the
case
must
proceed
.



Freedom
of
conscience
for
faith-based
ministries

The
freedom
of
conscience
allows
faith-based
ministries
to
provide
other
public
services
to
care
for
the
most
vulnerable
among
us
.


For
example
,
ADF
has
twice
defended
Downtown
Hope
Center
,
a
Christian
nonprofit
---------------
These
ministries
provide
critical
services
to
their
communities
.


And
they
do
so
because
of
their
religious
beliefs
.


This
is
a
common
feature
of
American
history
made
possible
by
the
freedom
of
conscience
.


In
that
way
,
protecting
the
ability
of
these
ministries
to
live
out
their
faith
ensures
that
other
religious
organizations
can
do
the
same
while
---------------
Conclusion

By
now
,
we’ve
answered
the
original
question—what
is
conscience
?


And
we’ve
answered
another—
why
is
freedom
of
conscience
worth
preserving
?



In
the
end
,
this
freedom
recognizes
the
inherent
dignity
of
each
person
