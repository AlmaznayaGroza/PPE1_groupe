what is freedom of conscience and why does it matter



what is “conscience”

 it s a word we re all familiar with—a clear
conscience a guilty conscience—even if we can t pinpoint an exact
definition



the concept pops up in all kinds of places

 in saturday morning cartoons
where good guys consult an angel on their right shoulder conscience
and a devil on their left shoulder temptation before making a
decision

 in literary masterpieces like crime and punishment where the

final good act after a lifetime of evil



but none of these examples capture the full concept of conscience

 as
americans we should consider the true meaning of “conscience

” we
should also recognize the importance—and privilege—of having the freedom
of conscience

 america was founded on this freedom

 and it s worth
preserving today



read on to find out why



what is freedom of conscience



conscience is our godgiven ability to discern right from wrong good
from evil

 but it s more than that

 for knowing right from wrong
wouldn t do much good if we didn t or couldn t act on what s right

 so
conscience also includes the ability to apply laws rules and
intuitions in the right way

 in other words to act on what we believe




action by serving others



where is freedom of conscience found in the constitution



america s founders understood the gravity of protecting the freedom of
conscience



james madison called conscience “the most sacred of all property

”
thomas jefferson said that no “provision in our constitution ought to be
dearer to man than that which protects the rights of conscience
against” the government

 and during the debate over what would become
the first amendment many lawmakers proposed protecting the rights of
conscience



this understanding shaped the first amendment

 although the amendment
doesn t explicitly mention “conscience” it protects its animating
features religious freedom and free speech

 the first amendment says
“congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or

speech or of the press

”

why is freedom of conscience important



these 26 words protect the freedom of conscience—the freedom to believe
without coercion and to speak and act consistently with those beliefs




things to which we object

 so we have the freedom to think reason
speak stay silent about and hold certain beliefs without fearing
government punishment

 that protects our private conscience



but our internal beliefs often move us to act publicly

 so the first


the freedom to act on our beliefs is important because community
standards—or lack thereof—reflect individuals conscience

 the more we
train our conscience to do what is right the better off we will be

 but
we lose our ability to discern right from wrong the more we consistently
ignore our conscience



the freedom of conscience has also benefitted america s common good


because of this freedom religious organizations have founded and
currently operate countless hospitals homeless shelters adoption

supreme court



what are some court cases dealing with freedom of conscience



the freedom of conscience is worth preserving

 several court cases seek
to do and have done just that

 consider three contexts



2

 the freedom of medical providers to decline to provide medical
procedures that violate their conscience



3

 the freedom of faithbased publicservice ministries to operate in
line with their religious purpose



freedom of conscience for artists

for almost eighty years the u

s

 supreme court has recognized that

its laws to force her to create websites promoting messages that
contradict her beliefs about marriage

 unwilling to violate the law or
her conscience lorie challenged the law to protect the cherished
freedom to speak consistently with her religious views on marriage

 


consistent with his belief about the immutability of sex

 lorie s
victory reaffirms that the supreme court still believes in the
importance of a free conscience

 that s how it should be

 every american
has the right to speak freely

 that s why lorie found support from a
diverse group of artists—from a worldrenowned graphic designer to a

artist who hold different views about marriage



freedom of conscience for healthcare professionals

beyond speech the freedom of conscience is imperative in the medical
field

 since ancient times physicians have sworn to “do no harm” to
their patients

 fast forward to present day and professional medical
ethics acknowledge the rights of professionals to decline to provide
medical treatment that violates their conscience



the justification echoes the first amendment—to preserve the personal

the case must proceed



freedom of conscience for faithbased ministries

the freedom of conscience allows faithbased ministries to provide other
public services to care for the most vulnerable among us

 for example
adf has twice defended downtown hope center a christian nonprofit

these ministries provide critical services to their communities

 and
they do so because of their religious beliefs

 this is a common feature
of american history made possible by the freedom of conscience

 in that
way protecting the ability of these ministries to live out their faith
ensures that other religious organizations can do the same while

conclusion

by now we ve answered the original question—what is conscience

 and
we ve answered another— why is freedom of conscience worth preserving



in the end this freedom recognizes the inherent dignity of each person
