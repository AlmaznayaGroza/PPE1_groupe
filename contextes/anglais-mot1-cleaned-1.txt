conscience

first published mon mar 14 2016 substantive revision tue oct 1 2024

reading the philosophical and historical literature on conscience the
first thing one would notice is the variety of meanings and
psychological and ethical assessments of the concept

 different
philosophical religious and common sense approaches to conscience have
emphasized different aspects of the following broad characterization
through our individual conscience we become aware of our deeply held
moral principles we are motivated to act upon them and we assess our
character our behavior and ultimately our self against those
principles

 the resulting more specific understandings of conscience
will be presented in the sections below

 on any of these accounts
conscience is defined by its inward looking and subjective character in
the following sense conscience is always knowledge of ourselves or
awareness of moral principles we have committed to or assessment of
ourselves or motivation to act that comes from within us as opposed to
external impositions

 this inward looking and subjective character of
conscience is also reflected in the etymological relation between the
notion of “conscience” and that of consciousness

 only after the 17th
century did “consciousness” start to be used with a distinct meaning
referring to the psychological and phenomenal dimension of the mind

shift see jorgensen 2014



the term “conscience” translates the latin “conscientia” which refers
to sharing “knowledge” scientia “with” con and which in turns
translates the equivalent greek term suneidenai see pierce 1955 and

whom that knowledge is shared with

 however the concept has
traditionally been used to refer to moral knowledge we talk
indifferently of conscience and moral conscience that is shared with
oneself

 this reference to the self does not rule out that the source of
the morality in question be external to the self

 for example it might

or of one s upbringing as in the freudian theory of the superego


reference to the self indicates that from a psychological point of
view conscience involves introspection awareness of one s behavior
and selfassessment

 as we shall see although these aspects often
overlap they are psychologically and conceptually distinct functions



ideal observer for instance a god an imagined moral model an
impartial spectator

 unfortunately debates in which appeals to
conscience are often made—for example the debate about conscientious
objection in health care—are often characterized by a lack of clarity as
to what it exactly is that we are talking about when we talk about
conscience and therefore about what exactly people are claiming when
they put forward a “conscientious objection” to for example abortion


in what sense does abortion violate the conscience of a committed
catholic doctor

 and is conscience amenable to reason and public
discussion or are appeals to conscience ultimately based on intuitions
and private morality

 in what sense is a conscientious choice different
from a mere moral preference

 the notion of conscience is in need of
conceptual clarification



this entry will expound the main features of the notion of conscience as
it is used in philosophical discussion religious teaching and in common
language alike

 the perspective adopted here will be theoretical rather

examples are drawn from christian source

 the entry is structured around
four possible but not mutually exclusive ways of conceptualizing
conscience

 these will be preceded by an introductory section outlining
the pluralistic morally neutral and subjective nature of the concept of
conscience

 the four main aspects of conscience that will be described
are the following

 section 2 discusses conscience as a faculty for
selfknowledge and selfassessment

 section 3 presents the epistemic
aspect of conscience that allows the formation of moral beliefs
distinguishing the different possible sources of moral principles that
inform such beliefs

 in section 4 conscience will be described as a
motivational force or as the source of our sense of duty which already
presupposes a body of moral knowledge or of moral beliefs

 finally
section 5 will focus on conscience understood as the body of personal
core and selfidentifying moral beliefs which is often taken to be the
basis of moral integrity fuss 1964 wicclair 2011 and of our sense of
personal identity childress 1979

 as discussed in section 6 this last
approach to conscience is often used with a political function to
advocate freedom of thought and action in liberal democratic societies

1

 conscience as pluralistic neutral and subjective

the concept of conscience does not bear any connection with any
particular substantial moral view broad 1940

 the voice of conscience
might suggest different principles and different behaviors to different
people

 in other words there is no psychological or conceptual relation
between conscience and any particular moral belief

 however as will be
explained below in the catholic tradition the idea of an erroneous
conscience is sometimes used to refer to conscience that fails to
recognize the true moral laws which it is naturally predisposed to
“witness” within our heart

 as for secular accounts of conscience the
independence of the notion of conscience from any substantial moral
content can be understood in three senses



first conscience is a pluralistic notion

 to say that a person acted
with conscience or that something violates someone s conscience does not
entail anything about what this act consists of or what this person s
moral values are although it might tell us that conscience is itself a
value this person holds dear

 to use a metaphor conscience is like an
empty box that can be filled with any type of moral content

 as put by
strohm

 conscience has what might be called an “identity problem”—that it
 possesses no fixed or inherited content of its own and that it can be
 hailed and mobilized in defence of one position or equally in defence

for example while some health practitioners raise “conscientious”
objection to abortion and refuse to provide the service someone s
conscience might demand the exact opposite i

e

 to perform abortions
in order to respect what is conscientiously believed to be a woman s
right joffe 1995



second conscience is typically a morally neutral concept

 appealing to
conscience does not usually add anything to the moral justification of
any particular conduct or principle

 unless one is committed to the
relativistic idea that your belief or your conscience about x being
right or wrong is what makes it right or wrong for you to do x foot
1979 something is not made morally better or worse acceptable or
unacceptable simply by being a matter of conscience

 for example the
morality of abortion has nothing to do with abortion being
conscientiously opposed by some health practitioners or conscientiously
supported by others

 this neutrality does not exclude however that an
appeal to conscience can represent itself as a reason for respecting
someone s moral views for example a reason for granting someone a right
to object to carrying out certain activities

 while appeals to
conscience do not typically provide any moral reason in defense of a
certain moral stance unless one is a relativist they might ground
political reasons for respecting individuals moral beliefs such as for
example tolerance or pluralism



finally conscience only concerns the subjective dimension of morality


even assuming that there are ethical values that in some sense can be
considered objective conscience only refers to what individuals
believe independently of any external objective proof or
justification

 and when people state what they subjectively and
conscientiously believe they acknowledge that other people might and
probably will subjectively and conscientiously hold different moral
views

 thus when i say that abortion violates my conscience i am not
saying although i might be thinking that abortion is morally wrong by
some objective standard and i m not necessarily trying to convince

standard



these three aspects related to the independence of conscience from
particular substantial moral views explain why appeals to conscience to
justify one s behavior are usually made with the expectation that no
further reason for the behavior in question be required

 as put by
childress when an agent appeals to her conscience

 usually the agent has given up the attempt to convince others of the

 rightness

 childress 1979 329

2

 conscience as selfknowledge and selfassessment

when we talk about conscience we often refer to reflection about
ourselves as moral persons and about our moral conduct

 through
conscience we examine ourselves as if we were our own inner judge

 the
image of an individual split into two persons one who acts and the
other who observes the former s conduct reflects the original
conception of “conscience” in the greek world at least from the 5th
century bce sorabji 2014 12

 but such self knowledge may also be
thought of as shared with others inside of us such as gods or other

actions kant 1797



the role of conscience in this sense is not that of merely gaining
knowledge about our behavior or character

 the knowledge in question is
typically though as explained below not always the ground for a
moral assessment by conscience

 when observing one s behavior
conscience is more like a judge or sometimes it is identified with the
judgment itself than like a disinterested observer

 thus for instance
the impartial spectator with which adam smith identified conscience
inspired by the stoic s notion of conscience as an imagined admired
philosopher judging one s conduct is not a morally and emotionally
neutral observer but generates a sentiment of approval or disapproval
of oneself smith 1759 and discussion in raphael 2007 34

 even in the
catholic view where the main characterization of conscience is that of
a witness of god s law in our hearts as described in section 3
conscience is also presented as “a moral judgment about man and his
actions a judgment either of acquittal or condemnation” john paul ii
1993 59

 analogously in the kantian view conscience is conceived of
as an inner court wood 2008 184 it is moral selfawareness that
allows one to apply the moral law suggested by practical reason to our
moral conduct and to judge whether we have complied with the moral law


as kant defines it in the metaphysics of morals conscience is

 practical reason holding the human being s duty before him for his

 consciousness of an internal court in man

 kant 1797 1991 189

this understanding of conscience as an inner court is well illustrated
by the story of huckleberry finn in mark twain s famous novel twain
1884 bennett 1974

 in a wellknown episode of the novel huck feels
guilty and blameworthy for having helped his slave friend jim to escape
from his owner miss watson

 blame does not come from some external moral
authority but it is a verdict issued by conscience according to its
moral laws

 the bites of conscience in huck s case were caused by a
tension between his feelings supporting what he did and the principles
he had inherited from his social environment

 at the time when the novel

helping slaves run away meant depriving someone of her private property


this was the “law” metaphorically speaking against which huck s
conscience assessed his behavior



this story illustrates another interesting feature of conscience as a
faculty for selfassessment i

e

 the asymmetry between our confidence
in the validity of the moral standards provided by our own conscience
and our confidence in the validity of the standards provided other
people s conscience

 huck thinks that what he did was wrong and that it
rendered him blameworthy in spite of his feelings because he thinks
that his own conscience provides a correct moral standard i

e

 a
standard that he endorses even if some of his feelings or beliefs
indicate otherwise

 this seems to reflect our common way of relating to
our own conscience we try to adjust our feelings and judgments to our
conscience s standard rather than vice versa

 however the same does
not hold when we talk of other people s conscience which is usually
taken to indicate their subjective moral standard and does not imply
that we are endorsing it

 this asymmetry suggests that there is no
conceptual relation between the notion of conscience per se and the
notion of an objective or correct moral standard rather it stresses
once more the fact that conscience has merely to do with one s private
morality and one s commitment to her own morality



consistently with this understanding of conscience as selfknowledge and
selfassessment it has been suggested by some that psychopaths—i

e


pathological subjects who display antisocial behavior and systematically
act without regard to what they consider to be right or wrong—can be
said to lack conscience hare 1999

 for instance according to
vujošević 2015 in psychopaths the link between moral knowledge or
beliefs and selfdirected feelings of condemnation e

g

 guilt is


as mentioned above in this section when expressing itself through
selfevaluative feelings conscience might be conceived of as either
constituted by such feelings fuss 1964 or as occasioning them broad
1940



in the former sense conscience as constituted by selfevaluative
feelings the feeling is an essential part of conscience

 conscience in
this case is better conceived not as a judge who issues sentences but
as a feeling with cognitive content—where the cognitive content concerns

cases the negative feeling informs me that what i am doing or am
contemplating doing is wrong according to my own moral parameters

 in
the latter sense conscience as occasioning selfevaluative feelings
the inner judge when in tension with one s conduct generates negative
selfdirected feelings mill 1861 ch 3

 for instance in freud the
“superego”—the part of our personality that attends to prohibitions
inhibitions and moral constraints—takes “the form of conscience” to
exercise its control over one s impulses and instincts by producing
negative evaluative feelings towards the individual such as
aggressiveness towards the ego and guilt freud 1929 2000 30

 as we
shall see below in section 4 these selfdirected negative feelings play
an essential role in fulfilling the motivational function of conscience



as the characterization of conscience as selfassessment here presented
suggests conscience has most often been associated with negative
feelings arendt 1971 such as shame guilt fear contrition

 for most
of us even in our common language conscience is something that yields
negative feelings more often than not—for example we often talk of the
“bites of conscience” or of conscience as causing us “remorse” which
derives from the latin “remordere” i

e

 “to bite again”

 however a
joyful conscience that praises and takes pride of one s own moral merit
can be conceived as well

 examples of joyful conscience can be found for
instance in cicero and some latin stoics most prominently seneca
sorabji 2014 25–30

 also in the protestant tradition started by
luther we find the idea of a joyful conscience where joy springs not
from pride or selfpraise but from awareness of god s future remission
of sins luther 1535 calvin 1536



the contrast between the protestant joyful conscience and the catholic
conscience burdened by negative feelings of guilt and fear was
emphasized by luther when he denounced the “terrorization of conscience”
by the roman catholic church

 according to luther with this
terrorization the roman catholic church aimed to reinforce its authority
and control over people conscience

 in fact conscience in the catholic
tradition can only be relieved from its burden of negative feelings
through the confession of one s sins to a priest and the penitence
decided by that priest



3

 the epistemic function of conscience

along with the previous nonepistemic conception of conscience we can
also understand conscience as having an epistemic function

 in this
sense conscience brings us some form of moral knowledge or moral
beliefs—either in an absolute sense e

g

 knowledge of divine laws or
in a relative sense e

g

 knowledge of social norms in one s culture



the epistemic role of conscience does not necessarily coincide with the
role of epistemic faculties or functions such as reason intuitions or
senses

 in particular that conscience “brings” us moral knowledge or
beliefs does not necessarily mean that it gives us direct access to the
source of this knowledge or of these beliefs as might be the case with
reason intuitions or senses



the knowledge we get from conscience understood as possessing an
epistemic function is often conceived as mediated knowledge

 this is
not surprising since as we have seen conscience is mostly understood
as inward looking which presupposes that the knowledge to which it
gives us access is already within us and that we acquired it through
some other process not involving conscience

 in fact on many accounts
conscience does not generate its own moral principles

 for example the
moral contents we discover within us can be acquired through divine
intervention as is the case with the laws of nature which according to
christians god infuses in our heart

 as we are going to see in
subsection 3

1 the understanding of conscience as having an epistemic
function and as the recipient of mediated knowledge is not exclusive to
religious views



on other accounts of conscience however conscience does give us direct
access to moral knowledge for example as an intuition about what is
good and what is bad



let us examine the two accounts of the epistemic role of conscience in
more detail



3

1 conscience as a faculty for indirect moral knowledge

in the christian tradition starting from paul the inward looking
character of conscience is emphasized by the metaphor of the witness
romans 2 14–15

 conscience does not allow us to acquire the knowledge
of the moral law directly from an external source god in this case
but only to witness the presence of god s laws within us

 conscience
cannot directly contemplate god

 the idea of a faculty that gives us
indirect and therefore imperfect knowledge of some external moral
authority suits religious traditions very well

 for example the idea
that through conscience we discover the true divine laws can also be
found in islam geaves 1999 164



it is important to note that also in this case as in the previous
understanding of conscience as selfawareness and selfassessment
conscience can be conceived as fulfilling an introspective function
i

e

 as being directed towards the self and towards one s own mental
states

 introspection allows one to gain selfknowledge schwitzgebel

before his papacy joseph ratzinger said that “something like an
original memory of the good and the true the two are identical has
been implanted in us” and conscience is

 so to speak an inner sense a capacity to recall so that the one whom


the catholic church also makes reference to “the voice of the lord
echoing in the conscience of every individual” john paul ii 1995 par


24



on this account—since conscience is only a witness and does not have
direct epistemic access to the source of knowledge i

e

 to
god—conscience is considered fallible and actually often erroneous 1
corinthians 44 aquinas 1265–1274 butler 1726 sermon 3 3

 in
particular conscience might fail to correctly interpret the divine laws
when applying them to real cases

 according to some 13th century
catholic theologians such as philip the chancellor albert the great
and most notably thomas aquinas conscience is the act of applying
universal principles i

e

 divine laws to real situations i

e

 it is
the conclusion of the practical syllogism whose first premise is a
universal principle provided by a separate faculty called “synderesis”
aquinas summa theologiae 1 q79 langston 2000 and 2015 sorabji 2014
62–66 as such conscience can be erroneous in deriving moral
conclusions from first principles aquinas on truth q17 art

 2 and
discussion in d arcy 1961 100–103

 however other catholic thinkers
have emphasized the essential role of conscience in humans search for
the truth

 cardinal john henry newman for instance saw conscience as
the moral sense that can lead us to the moral truth

 as such conscience
is in his view both epistemic and action guiding but the two aspects
are not distinguishable to the extent that the moral truth is what
guides our actions

 as he wrote “the feeling of conscience is
twofold it is a moral sense and a sense of duty a judgment of the
reason and a magisterial dictate

 of course its act is indivisible

instills moral principles in us is not god but one s own culture or
upbringing

 in this case the moral knowledge in question is typically
understood in a relativistic sense our conscience is the faculty
through which the social norms of our culture or the norms of our
upbringing are evoked and exert their influence on our moral psychology


these norms explain our moral feelings and our moral choices but what
conscience tells us in this case is the product of social and cultural
dynamics over which we have little control

 as the case of huckleberry
finn s conscience demonstrates hardly can conscience so understood be
credited any moral authority since our educators or our culture might
be highly immoral for example our conscience might end up drawing on
racist or discriminatory principles such as the ones which supported
slavery in huck s social environment

 and in fact unsurprisingly many
are rather skeptical or dismissive of the moral authority of conscience
since they see it as mere opinion about moral principles influenced or
even determined by one s own culture montaigne 1580 book 1 ch

 22
hobbes 1651 ch

 7

 in this sense conscience is a merely relativistic
notion whose content changes according to social cultural and familial
circumstances



3

2 conscience as a faculty for direct moral knowledge

contrary to what montaigne and hobbes had claimed rousseau argued in
emile or education that good education can free conscience from the
corrupting influences of societies

 actually one of the aims of
education is to render the young autonomous moral thinkers and agents by
teaching them how to critically examine and if necessary replace
received norms rousseau 1762 see sorabji 2014 for a discussion

 the
idea here is that conscience is what remains of our innate moral sense
once we free it from “childish errors” and “prejudices of our
upbringing” rousseau 1921 1762 253

 as rousseau presents it

 justice and virtue by which in spite of our maxims we judge our own
 actions or those of others to be good or evil and it is this
 principle that i call conscience

 rousseau 1921 1762 253

according to rousseau then conscience has a natural tendency to
perceive and follow the right order of nature and a good teacher should
help the young s conscience to do what it is naturally predisposed to
do

 in rousseau s words

 too often does reason deceive us we have only too good a right to
 doubt her but conscience never deceives us she is the true guide of
 man it is to the soul what instinct is to the body he who obeys his
 conscience is following nature and he need not fear that he will go
 astray let us obey the call of nature we shall see that her yoke is
 easy and that when we give heed to her voice we find a joy in the
 answer of a good conscience

 rousseau 1921 1762 252

this understanding of conscience as a deeper form of moral knowledge
brings us to the second sense in which conscience can be said to have an
epistemic role

 as well as merely witnessing received opinions or divine
laws conscience can also be conceived as a moral sense giving us direct
access to moral principles

 understood in this way conscience is
typically seen as intuitive and influenced by emotions rather than a
reasonbased faculty

 in particular 18th century sentimentalist
philosophers often e

g

 shaftesbury 1711 and hume 1738–1740
identified conscience with a moral “sentiment” or moral “sense”


according to hume s psychological theory for instance “reason is
wholly inactive and can never be the source of so active a principle as
conscience or a sense of morals” hume 1738–1740 book 3 part 1
section 1

 also on more recent accounts of conscience and of private
morality the dictates of conscience can be understood as expressions of
our moral intuitions

 according to thagard and finn 2011 for
instance “conscience is a kind of moral intuition” p

 168 that is
“both cognitive and emotional”p

156



once again there are reasons to doubt the epistemic and moral authority
of conscience so understood

 a lot of work in recent moral psychology
aimed at understanding moral disagreement has suggested that there are
seemingly irreconcilable differences in fundamental moral intuitions and
emotions among people with different worldviews e

g

 haidt 2012
greene 2013

 these differences in fundamental moral intuitions seem to
undermine the epistemic status of conscience and with it conscience s
moral authority not least because most of our moral intuitions seem
according to these recent developments in moral psychology not to be
amenable to revision in light of new evidence or new good reasons


reasoning on any plausible account should be an important part of
morality however what our conscience tells us may have little to do
with reasons and evidence

 theoretical work in moral psychology e

g


haidt 2012 graham et al

 2009 haidt 2001 supported by evidence from

liberal views are often driven by other specific emotions e

g

 anger
and intuitions e

g

 intuitive rejection of fairness violations or
liberty infringements haidt 2001 and 2012

 if conscience simply is the
expression of moral intuition and if individuals have significantly
different and irreconcilable moral intuitions then individuals also
have significantly different and difficulttoreconcile conscientious
moral consciences



4

 conscience as motivation to act morally

conscience can also be conceived as our sense of duty

 according to this
understanding conscience motivates us to act according to moral
principles or beliefs we already possess e

g

 d arcy 1963 childress
1979 mcguire 1963 fuss 1964

 conscience so understood “establishes a
general sense of moral obligation in the individual s consciousness”
fuss 1964 116

 the subjective character of conscience implies that
the motivational force must come entirely from within the individual as
opposed to sanctions from an external authority



a powerful motivational source is represented by the feelings that
conscience generates in its selfassessment function

 as we said at the
beginning the different understandings of conscience presented here are
not necessarily mutually exclusive

 conscience as selfassessment and
conscience as motivation to act morally constitute a good example of
perspectives on conscience which are not only consistent with one
another but which actually complete one another

 in kant for example
the theory of conscience can be seen as “a motivation theory set in the
context of a reflection theory” wood 2008 183 as wood interprets the
kantian notion of conscience “conscience is a feeling of pleasure or
displeasure associated with myself” that arises when i comply or don t
comply with moral principles and that motivates me to act in one sense
rather than the other when the feeling accompanies the contemplation of
a certain course of action wood 2008 183–184

 conscience for kant is
therefore not only an inner court but also a source of motivation to
act morally that is motivation to follow our sense of duty as
determined by reason kant 1797 1991 161



more generally as we have seen in section 1 conscience s
selfassessment often produces remorse or other negative feelings
guilt shame fear and so on

 our desire or tendency to avoid this
form of selfpunishment can have motivational force towards acting
morally

 thus for instance according to childress the motive for
acting morally that defines conscience is “in part avoidance of a
sanction imposed by the self on itself” childress 1979 328



consistent with this philosophical view are studies in developmental
psychology suggesting that the emotion of guilt which is typically seen
as one of the products of conscience as selfassessment is “the
motivational engine that infuses misdeeds with negative personal
valence” kochanska and aksan 2006 1589

 transgression generates

selfdirected feelings presuppose one another this need not be the
case

 it is possible to conceive of an external or independent source of
that most fundamental sense of duty that constitutes our conscience
such as for example our moral education and upbringing mill 1861 ch


3

 but the sense of duty that identifies a conscientious person can
also be conceived as a primitive function an innate disposition which
is not explained by any other more fundamental mechanism

 in kant for
instance “every human being as a moral being has a conscience within
him originally” kant 1797 1991 160 and conscience is one of the
four “natural predispositions of the mind for being affected by
concepts of duty” the other three being moral feeling love for one s

negative feelings and sense of duty are not always successful in
prompting agents to do what their moral principles require

 but the
“bites of conscience” or just the prospect of bites of conscience act
as motivational force towards aligning our future behavior to those
norms

 of course positive feelings associated with conscience might
also have a motivational force

 for example as seen above kant
associated conscience also with positive feelings about oneself when the
agent recognizes he has acted according to his sense of duty

 rousseau
alongside the epistemic account of conscience presented above also
provides in emile a motivational account of conscience based on positive
feelings while reason gives us knowledge of the good it is conscience
through a sentiment of love for the good which motivates us to behave
morally rousseau 1762



5

 conscience selfidentifying moral commitments and moral integrity

the subjective character of conscience delimits a sphere of personal
morality that is an essential part of our sense of personal identity
understood as our sense of who we are and of what characterizes
qualitatively our individuality for instance our character our
psychological traits our past experience etc



 my conscience is what
makes me this particular individual in a social and cultural context
that i want to keep separate from me



this private space in which the individual finds her own sense of
identity often grounds the political use of the notion of conscience


thus many people claim the right to stick to their
conscience—particularly by advancing so called “conscientious
objection”—when social expectations or legal obligations would demand
otherwise

 these political appeals to conscience are usually made on the
basis of two principles

 the first is the principle of respect for moral
integrity which finds its justification in the close relationship
between the notions of conscience and of moral integrity on one side
childress 1979 and the sense of personal identity on the other

 the
second principle often invoked in the political uses of “conscience” is
the principle of “freedom of conscience”

 the former will be discussed
in this section and the latter in the next section



the concept of personal identity in the sense in which the notion is
used here—i

e what defines me as this particular person in a qualitative
sense—is intimately related to the notions of conscience wicclair 2011
childress 1979 and of moral integrity and more specifically to the
“identity view of integrity” cox et al

 2013 williams 1973 and 1981



their life is fundamentally about” cox et al

 2013

 this
identityconferring aspect of one s morality is exactly what some people
call “conscience”

 according to childress for example

 in appealing to conscience i indicate that i am trying to preserve a
 sense of myself my wholeness and integrity my good conscience and
 that i cannot preserve these qualities if i submit to certain
 requirements of the state or society

 childress 1979 327

conscience as selfidentifying can be understood in two ways

 it can be
thought of either as a set of core and selfidentifying moral beliefs
that are “integral to an agent s understanding of who she is i

e

 her

viewed in relation to one s self and character” bluestein 1993 294



conceived in either way conscience is an essential part of our
understanding of what kind of person we are and this is taken to be a
reason for warranting protection of conscience and conscientious
objection in different contexts particularly in the health care
professions wicclair 2011 25–26 bluestein 1993 295



we have seen above that there is a sense in which according to some
psychopaths can be said to lack conscience hare 1999 psychopaths are
not capable of connecting their moral knowledge to their conduct through
the feelings of guilt and disapproval which conscience on some
accounts produces

 interestingly according to some psychologists
psychopaths are also less likely to base their sense of personal

leads us to say that a certain individual is not the same person anymore
strohminger and nichols 2015

 these findings provide empirical support
to the idea that conscience is essential to one s sense of personal
identity and to attributions of personal identity

 freedom of conscience

some people have suggested that appeals to freedom of conscience tend to
be more vigorously put forward and more effective in contexts where
political or religious structures lose power or moral authority

 thus
for instance according to c

a

 pierce

 conscience only came into its own in the greek world after the
 collapse of the citystate

 the close integration of politics with
 ethics with the former predominant was no longer possible there was
 no sufficiently close authority external to the individual
 effectively to direct conduct

 consequently as a pis aller men fell
 back on the internal chastisement of the conscience as the only
 authority

 pierce 1955 76

the same can be said for 17th century england with its crisis of
religious authority and the frequent appeals to freedom of conscience in
the philosophical and political literature of that time childress 1979
326



there are three main arguments that can be used to defend a principle of
freedom of conscience

 two of them are frequently found in the 16th
and 17th century philosophical literature they are the “argument
from ineffectiveness or hypocrisy” and the “argument from ignorance”

a the argument from ineffectiveness or hypocrisy is based on the
relevance of the distinction between beliefs and acts for the definition
of conscience

 according to this argument it is not possible to compel
someone to believe or to not believe something i

e

 to change one s
conscientious beliefs

 all we can do is compel people to act as if they

if some authority aims to convert people or to change people s moral
views prohibiting the free expression through actions of one s
conscience would not serve this purpose



this line of argument was often put forward by early christians most

practice their cult in a time where they were persecuted by roman
governors their claim was that forcing them to abandon the christian
cults would have no effect on their conscience

 the same line of
argument can also be found in locke s works on toleration the essay
concerning toleration of 1667 and a letter concerning toleration of


however christians did not seem to believe in the force of this
argument and more generally in the principle of freedom of conscience
when later on they attempted to justify the violent persecution of
heretics those who revise their religious dogmas and apostates those

to follow the true religion—by which he meant persecuting heretics—could
open their eyes to the truth sorabji 2014 49–50

 this thesis implies
that sometimes conscience even if we confine it to matters of inward
conviction and not to behavior can be influenced by some external
imposition



this latter approach based on the idea of bringing the truth to
conscience by “freeing” conscience from error is consistent with the
catholic peculiar understanding of the notion of freedom of conscience


philosophically speaking “freedom of conscience” is typically
understood as an individualistic concept that allows for a plurality of
moral and religious views strohm 2011 90

 for the catholic church

newman joseph ratzinger writes that in the catholic view “truth” is the
middle term that reconciles authority of god and subjectivity of
conscience the latter when authentically free cannot but reveal the
truth established by the former ratzinger 1991 2010

 since as we
have seen above in the catholic view reason alone can t create its own

of that law” of god john paul ii 1993 par

 35

 so when practical
reason is free to exercise its “participation” john paul ii 1993 sec


40 in the divine law then “in the depths of his conscience man
detects a law which he does not impose upon himself but which holds him
to obedience” paul vi 1965 par

 16



in any case it is not necessary to dismiss the argument from
ineffectiveness in order to justify imposing norms and practices that
might violate individuals conscience

 actually the same argument from
ineffectiveness can be used to support the imposition of policies that
might conflict with individuals consciences

 on the basis of the idea
that conscience is merely a matter of private beliefs not of action
some authors have argued that compelling people to follow certain rules
even against their conscience would not constitute a violation of their
freedom of conscience and is therefore justifiable

 this was the line
of argument pursued for example by thomas hobbes 1651 chapter 40
baruch spinoza 1670 chapter 20 and john locke 1660 who argued that
the state has the power to enforce certain practices even when citizens
claim that it would violate their conscience in order to protect social
order



b the “argument from ignorance” which might be better labeled
“argument from humility” is based on a skeptical approach to the
content of conscience

 the possibility exists that what we
conscientiously believe is wrong and that those holding conscientious
beliefs opposite to ours are right

 therefore there is a reason for not

a significant proportion of its religious and moral authority following
the protestant reform in 16th and 17th century—which was defined
by keith thomas 1993 as “the age of conscience”

 it was at that time
that we assisted to the “secularization of conscience” in the modern era
strohm 2011 although the phenomenon would be better conceived of as a
“resecularization” since conscience was not related to the voice or
the authority of god in the greek world




john locke in his second letter concerning toleration

 locke had to rely
on this argument as an alternative strategy to defend freedom of
conscience after the anglican priest jonas proast pointed out that
compulsion can actually change personal beliefs as augustine had
argued and that therefore the argument from ineffectiveness that locke

conscientious objection in health care



c finally the third argument in defense of freedom of conscience is
what i have called above the “argument from legitimization”

 john stuart
mill 1859 defended freedom of conscience by appealing to the idea that
allowing the free expression of any opinion and particularly mistaken
opinions would allow truth to emerge more clearly and would provide us

 any rational assurance of being right

1 freedom of conscience and conscientious objection today

freedom of conscience is today protected by the united nations universal
declaration of human rights which reads “everyone has the right to
freedom of thought conscience and religion” art

 18



according to strohm this article should not be taken to imply freedom
to act according to one s conscience but it only refers to “matters of
inward conviction” strohm 2011 88

 if this interpretation is correct
article 18 does not seem to raise any interesting philosophical or

matters of inward conviction

 more problematic is the moral and
political debate about the freedom to act or to refrain from acting
according to one s conscience especially where there are professional
roles or legal obligations that would demand otherwise

 in fact appeals
to conscience and freedom of conscience are often deployed to claim and
justify “conscientious objection” to certain activities that someone
would otherwise be required to perform




as most states have now abolished conscription appeals to freedom of
conscience and to conscientious objection today can be found mainly in
debates in medical ethics with regard to health practitioners who
conscientiously object to performing medical procedures they morally


according to those who are against a right to conscientious objection
professional obligations trump any value conscience might have and any
principle that might justify conscientious objection qua conscientious

 conclusion

there is no such a thing as the notion of conscience both in a
philosophical and in a psychological sense

 as we have seen the concept
of conscience has been given different interpretations throughout
history sometimes on the basis of underlying systematic philosophical
theories of the mind and of morality and sometimes serving religious or

this lack of uniformity is not only a problem for historians and
theoretical philosophers

 because it cannot be immediately clear what we
are talking about when we talk of conscience of freedom of conscience
or of conscientious objection it is important that clarity is made
every time conscience is appealed to in different branches of applied
philosophy particularly medical ethics and in public debates alike



this entry has presented a conceptual map rather than a historical
account of conscience which can provide some guidance for those
engaged in this clarificatory task

 one of the benefits of clarifying
concepts and clarifying them in the different circumstances in which
they are used is their subsequent demystification



conscience needs to be demystified since it is one of those concepts
that tend to elicit reverence rather than questions or an interest in
further inquiry

 as seen above appeals to conscience often replace
reason giving and are made with the expectation that no further reason
for one s decisions and positions is requested

 this attitude is also
displayed in many legislative approaches dealing with the notion of
conscience in particular legislations about conscientious objection in
health care typically grant doctors a right to object to performing
certain professional activities e

g

 conscientious objection to

let alone submitting reasons to some form of assessment



this entry has distinguished four main understandings of conscience
drawing on the philosophical tradition of the concept

 whether the
concept is to be understood as a faculty for selfknowledge and

selfidentifying moral beliefs or a combination of any of these
characterizations it is important to have clear in mind what exactly we
are talking about when we talk of conscience and of freedom of
conscience in each circumstance



far from being a conversationstopper conscience can only find its
proper place in philosophical and in public discussion if its
philosophical and psychological aspects are teased out defined and
assessed

 appeals to conscience can only be part of philosophical
political and legal discussion if they are seen as the start not the
end of discussions
