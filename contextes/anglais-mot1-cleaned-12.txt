 conscience and moral rules in adam smith

conscience and moral rules in adam smith

sympathy impartial spectator duty selfdeceit moral sentiments


in this essay i explore adam smith s analysis of the origins of
conscience and general moral rules in the theory of moral sentiments

 i
argue that adam smith offers a distinction between moral conscience and
general moral rules that sidesteps the traditional distinction between
universal and relative moral standards leading to a fundamental
rethinking of the problem of the variability of moral opinion and the
demands of moral conscience and duty



moral conscience

like the thought of his mentor francis hutcheson and of his friend david

impartial spectator position to correct for any bias in our judgments



smith s notion of moral conscience follows directly from this general
approach

 he believes we cultivate a moral conscience by learning to
view ourselves our intentions and our actions from a position of
impartial spectatorship

 from this position we cultivate a concern with
praiseworthiness and blameworthiness not praise and blame

 being
virtuous and having a fully developed moral conscience for smith
represents the highest stage in the moral development of an individual




what is fit and proper either to be done or to be avoided” tms 159


the specific mechanism by which these rules are formed is considerably
different from the cultivation of conscience

 take the emergence of
negative rules or commands that order us not to do something

 we observe
another s behavior and disapprove of it

 we hear others express similar

words general moral rules are formed out of our judgments of particular
experiences that we observe in conjunction with the judgments of others


a desire for praise or an aversion to blame not the moral conscience s
concern for praiseworthiness or aversion to blameworthiness compels us
to develop them

 after these general rules are formed and “universally

notion of the universality of the moral standards that have emerged in
the society in which we live

 finally this view explains how tensions
arise when the judgments of our moral conscience might be displaced or
at least come into conflict with the general rules that are established
in a particular society and to which we feel deep sentimental
attachments

 in smith s world there is no guarantee that the
conclusions of our sense of moral conscience will dovetail neatly into
our sense of duty





smith s conclusions about the difference between the dictates of moral
conscience and our sense of duty to obey general rules are profound


virtuous individuals guided by moral conscience cultivate the feelings
that are appropriate to particular situations

 for example when
confronted with the benevolent behavior of another they feel gratitude

conduct can be much depended upon” tms 163



the tension between conscience and duty

for smith humans are subject to multiple commands in ethics some
stemming from the dictates of conscience and others from duty

 when
should the principle of duty be the sole principle regulating our
conduct in the world and when should it concur with other motives such
as those provided by moral conscience

 conscience and duty introduce
tension into smith s understanding of moral judgement and action in the
theory of moral sentiments

 understanding that tension between the
demands of conscience and duty lies at the heart of the final chapter of
part vi



some moral judgements are guided primarily by moral conscience others
are guided by general rules and our sense of duty

 given the
characteristics of a particular passion individuals may face a
difficult task of balancing between the demands of conscience and of
duty

 for example regarding benevolent and social sentiments like love
our moral judgements and actions flow naturally from our benevolent

parliament seeking reelection or a tradesman seeking a special job
must be grounded at least in part by the passion of ambition and not
just duty or conscience for successful advancement and social
recognition



a second issue that follows from the distinction between conscience and
duty involves the precision and exactness of the general moral rules
themselves

 some rules are clearer and more important to society than

theory of moral sentiments and remains prone to misinterpretation

 one
might easily argue that what smith means to say is that the conclusions
of conscience are the general laws of morality backed by our religious
sentiment

 from this interpretation conscience can easily be identified
as “vicegerents of god” that reward us for following the law and punish
us for breaking it

 if my reading of the sharp distinction between duty
and conscience is correct this reading is seriously mistaken

 as i
argue above our general rules of morality are generalizations based
upon our observations of our moral judgments in conjunction with those
of others

 they are not conclusions of our moral conscience

 conscience
deals with the problem of praiseworthiness duty centers upon the
problem of praise

 all people have the capacity for moral
generalization

 all people do not have a highly functioning moral sense
of conscience

 the “vicegerents of god” that smith is referring to are
not just the sentiments involved with conscience

 they encompass all our
moral faculties including our sense of propriety and impropriety our
sense of merit and demerit and our sense of duty



the significance of the distinction between conscience and duty in
smith s thought is revealed most clearly at the end of chapter v in part
iii

 smith emphasizes that while he wants to distinguish between duty
and conscience he does not want to say they are necessarily
antithetical to one another

 on the contrary for the most part they
complement one another

 he comments that “the general rules by which


there are natural limits to what we can do to impose the teaching of our
consciences upon the world

 but that does not mean that we must deny our
consciences out of hand

 indignation in the face of perceived unfairness
is a natural response of our conscience to the world at times

 we may
not always be able to construct the world in the way that we wish but
we do not have to like it at the deepest levels of our being
