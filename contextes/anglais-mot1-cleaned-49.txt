By
“intellectual
conscience
,”
Nietzsche
means
the
idea
that
it
is
wrong
to
believe
something
unless
you
have
good
reason
to
think
that
the
belief
is
true
.


Someone
with
an
intellectual
conscience
will
form
and
endorse
beliefs
by
applying
the
best
epistemic
standards
known
to
him
or
her
.



Most
of
us
,
Nietzsche
thinks
,
lack
an
intellectual
conscience
:


[T
]he
great
majority
of
people
lacks
an
intellectual
conscience
.


[…

I
mean
:
the
great
majority
of
people
does
not
consider
it
contemptible
to
believe
this
or
that
and
to
live
accordingly
,
without
first

Science

)

Exercising
the
intellectual
conscience
,
if
one
does
possess
it
,
doesn’t
necessarily
lead
to
certainty
;
on
the
contrary
.


The
more
you
subject
your
beliefs
to
scrutiny
,
the
less
certain
you
will
become
about
them
.

Although
intellectual
conscience
is
a
necessary
condition
,
it
is
not
,
Nietzsche
seems
to
think
,
a
sufficient
one
.


The
“last
idealists
of
knowledge
in
whom
alone
the
intellectual
conscience
dwells
today
,”
namely
the
scientists
,
have
rendered
Christian
belief
untenable
,
but
they
shrink
from
questioning
their
own
values
.

Properly
employed
by
an
authentic
free
spirit
,
intellectual
conscience
works
against
the
tendency
to
assimilate
novel
experiences
or
problems
to
already-familiar
explanations
and
evaluations
.

The
best
article
I
know
of
on
Nietzsche’s
concept
of
intellectual
conscience
is
Jeremy
Page’s
“Nietzsche
on
Honesty”
(2019
)
.

depiction
of

I
can
