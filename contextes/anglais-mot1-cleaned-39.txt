conscience

your individual conscience is the final arbiter of what is right or
wrong



“the church your parents grandma no one has the right to suggest that
your conscience is wrong or that your conscience makes you a bad
catholic

”


theological school

our conscience can be described as our knowledge of ourselves our
awareness of the moral principles we are committed to and our
motivation to act



one of the most fundamental teachings in the catholic tradition is the
primacy of conscience

 this doctrine states that catholics must use
their reason to discern ethically complex situations and that our
individual consciences should be the final arbiter in all moral
decisionmaking



the catechism of the catholic church states that we have the right to
act in conscience and in freedom to make moral decisions and that no one
should be forced to act contrary to their consciences



as catholics we believe that we must use all of the resources available
to us to form our consciences so that we can make the best possible
decisions for ourselves particularly in morally complex circumstances


we believe this is particularly essential when making choices regarding

catholics for choice fights for the rights of all individuals to make
decisions regarding sexual and reproductive health based on their own
consciences

 but we are conscious of the fact that poverty racism and
other forms of powerlessness often limit the possibility of using one s
conscience

 for this reason we also strive to dismantle the structures
of injustice that force people into situations in which they have few
if any choices

questions about conscience

we ve compiled these talking points to help inform catholic
conversations about conscience



what is a conscience



our conscience is our capacity to judge right from wrong and good from
evil

 it is an internal moral compass that seeks truth and wisdom to
guide own behavior and decisions

 one s conscience draws upon moral
codes that come from religion and society as well as one s internal
belief systems and personal values



what factors inform your conscience



many factors form one s conscience

 they include the wisdom of one s
religious tradition of course

 but a wellformed conscience also
incorporates knowledge from other sources such as science medicine
ethical frameworks and our own experience



are there limits on the ways in which we can use our conscience



one s individual conscience should always be the ultimate authority in
all moral decisionmaking

 however sinful structures of gender
inequality systemic racism economic insecurity and immigration status
can limit one s ability to make choices

 the ability to use one s
conscience and make choices is too often a luxury enjoyed by those who
are wealthy white and privileged

 as catholics committed to a rich
tradition of social justice teachings we must dismantle the injustices
that prevent people from being able to exercise their consciences and
make choices for themselves

making choices in your own good conscience begins with being informed
