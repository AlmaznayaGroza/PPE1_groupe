Conscience

Your
individual
conscience
is
the
final
arbiter
of
what
is
right
or
wrong
.



“The
church
,
your
parents
,
grandma
,
no
one
has
the
right
to
suggest
that
your
conscience
is
wrong
or
that
your
conscience
makes
you
a
bad
Catholic
.

”

Theological
School

Our
conscience
can
be
described
as
our
knowledge
of
ourselves
,
our
awareness
of
the
moral
principles
we
are
committed
to
,
and
our
motivation
to
act
.



One
of
the
most
fundamental
teachings
in
the
Catholic
tradition
is
the
primacy
of
conscience
.


This
doctrine
states
that
Catholics
must
use
their
reason
to
discern
ethically
complex
situations
and
that
our
individual
consciences
should
be
the
final
arbiter
in
all
moral
decision-making
.



The
Catechism
of
the
Catholic
Church
states
that
we
have
the
right
to
act
in
conscience
and
in
freedom
to
make
moral
decisions
and
that
no
one
should
be
forced
to
act
contrary
to
their
consciences
.



As
Catholics
,
we
believe
that
we
must
use
all
of
the
resources
available
to
us
to
form
our
consciences
so
that
we
can
make
the
best
possible
decisions
for
ourselves
,
particularly
in
morally
complex
circumstances
.


We
believe
this
is
particularly
essential
when
making
choices
regarding

Choice
fights
for
the
rights
of
all
individuals
to
make
decisions
regarding
sexual
and
reproductive
health
based
on
their
own
consciences
.


But
we
are
conscious
of
the
fact
that
poverty
,
racism
and
other
forms
of
powerlessness
often
limit
the
possibility
of
using
one’s
conscience
.


For
this
reason
,
we
also
strive
to
dismantle
the
structures
of
injustice
that
force
people
into
situations
in
which
they
have
few
,
if
any
,
choices
.

Questions
about
Conscience

We
'
ve
compiled
these
talking
points
to
help
inform
Catholic
conversations
about
conscience
.



What
is
a
conscience
?



Our
conscience
is
our
capacity
to
judge
right
from
wrong
and
good
from
evil
.


It
is
an
internal
moral
compass
that
seeks
truth
and
wisdom
to
guide
own
behavior
and
decisions
.


One’s
conscience
draws
upon
moral
codes
that
come
from
religion
and
society
,
as
well
as
one’s
internal
belief
systems
and
personal
values
.



What
factors
inform
your
conscience
?



Many
factors
form
one’s
conscience
.


They
include
the
wisdom
of
one’s
religious
tradition
,
of
course
.


But
a
well-formed
conscience
also
incorporates
knowledge
from
other
sources
,
such
as
science
,
medicine
,
ethical
frameworks
and
our
own
experience
.



Are
there
limits
on
the
ways
in
which
we
can
use
our
conscience
?



One’s
individual
conscience
should
always
be
the
ultimate
authority
in
all
moral
decision-making
.


However
,
sinful
structures
of
gender
inequality
,
systemic
racism
,
economic
insecurity
and
immigration
status
can
limit
one’s
ability
to
make
choices
.


The
ability
to
use
one’s
conscience
and
make
choices
is
too
often
a
luxury
enjoyed
by
those
who
are
wealthy
,
white
and
privileged
.


As
Catholics
committed
to
a
rich
tradition
of
social
justice
teachings
,
we
must
dismantle
the
injustices
that
prevent
people
from
being
able
to
exercise
their
consciences
and
make
choices
for
themselves
.
