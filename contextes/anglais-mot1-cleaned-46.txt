the modern misunderstanding of conscience

the catholic church teaches that the conscience is a natural facility of
our reason that directs us to do good and avoid evil that makes
judgments about the good and evil of particular acts and that bears
witness after the fact to the good or evil that we have done such as
what we call “having a guilty conscience

”¹

a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of the human conscience lies
at the root of many of the problems in the catholic church today

 very
few catholics even know what that role actually is

 when pressed many
will say something along the lines of “if my conscience tells me that a
particular action is all right i can do it

”

this is just another way of saying “if it feels good do it

” if an
improperlyformed conscience leads a person to accept something as right
and good based simply on his or her uninformed opinions and feelings
that person will fall into grave errors for which there is no good

 they are a law to themselves even though they do not have the law


 they show that what the law requires is written on their hearts while
 their conscience also bears witness and their conflicting thoughts
 accuse or perhaps excuse them on that day when according to my
 gospel god judges the secrets of men by christ jesus

 romans
 21415

many catholics erroneously believe that the conscience is a teacher not
a pupil that it is the source of morality

 this is not the teaching of
the catholic church

 according to the church the conscience is a
witness to the moral law authored by god

 each catholic is required to
obey that moral law in all things

 the conscience if properly formed
calls him to obey that moral law and helps him to understand how to
apply it in particular cases



result a deformed belief system

the belief that the conscience is a moral authority in its own right has
resulted in catholics supporting and promoting many intrinsic evils
including contraception sterilization abortion homosexual activity


many organizations vigorously promote this false understanding of the
human conscience in order to gain more support from catholic laity

 one
of these groups is “catholics” for choice cfc whose mission consists
of attempting to convince people that they can be proabortion and still
be “good catholics

” in its quarterly magazine ironically entitled
conscience cfc attempts to legitimize the obvious paradox that “church
law affirms both the right and the responsibility of a catholic to
follow his or her conscience even when it conflicts with church
teaching”² emphasis added



cfc also alleges

 the catholic church officially teaches that the conscience of an
 individual is supreme

 if you carefully examine your conscience and
 then decide that an abortion is the most moral act you can do at this
 time you are not committing a sin

 therefore you are not

it is easy to demonstrate that cfc does not really believe this
principle itself

 for example would it concede that it was legitimate
for someone to “carefully examine their conscience” and then decide that
torching an abortion clinic in the middle of the night was “the most
moral act they could do at this time

”

gaystraight alliance whose purpose is to disseminate homophile
propaganda in the schools is “the embodiment of a perfectlyformed
catholic conscience

” she dismissed her critics who quoted actual
church teachings on homosexuality as “archaic

”⁴


personal judgement vs

 objective standards

how does conscience relate to morality



in order for a person s conscience to be conditioned to accept evil it
must first decisively turn away from god s teachings and decide that it
can determine for itself what is right and wrong ignoring all external

this means that dissenters must justify their claims by assuming that
there is no fixed morality that is binding on all persons

 the only
source of morality is the conscience of each individual

 one phrase that
is coming into common usage among the selfappointed elite is “this is
my truth

”

would permit



natural law gives moral principles to conscience which then makes
decisionsnatural law gives moral principles to conscience which then
makes decisions


it is one thing for a person to say “i disagree with the church s
teaching on abortion

” it is another thing entirely to say “the church
teaches that abortion is permissible so long as my conscience allows
it

” this statement is false and can only be uttered by one who is
grossly ignorant of church teaching or who deliberately lies about such


a person is culpable for the evil he commits when he “takes little
trouble to find out what is true and good or when conscience is by
degrees almost blinded through the habit of committing sin

”⁵


 

the formation of the conscience

the conscience is a precious gift and it must be cared for by forming it
with prayer and education for the duration of our lives



the catechism states “the education of conscience is indispensable for
human beings who are subjected to negative influences and tempted by sin
to prefer their own judgment and to reject authoritative teachings”
¶1783



a dead giveaway that a person s conscience is improperly formed is when
he or she says something like “i respect the teachings of the church
but i follow my own conscience in matters of sexual morality

” nancy
pelosi gave us a typical example of this deception when she claimed that
she was a “practicing and respectful catholic” but regarding the

position is

”⁶

this means that the person s conscience has become disconnected from the
truth

 this has several root causes catechism ¶1792


 bad example given by others
 enslavement to one s passions
 assertion of a mistaken notion of autonomy of conscience
 rejection of the church s authority and her teaching
 lack of conversion and of charity

”

by contrast a properly‑formed catholic conscience has been rigorously
educated is fully aware of the intrinsically evil nature of abortion
and other evils and is led by this knowledge to vigorously oppose them



failure to act is not a viable option



it is true that catholics must follow their consciences but their
consciences must be formed by the word of god which is authentically
interpreted and taught by the magisterium of the catholic church to
which christ entrusted his authority to teach in his name

 the
conscience must be continuously schooled to recognize not to determine
what is and is not moral activity



as the catechism teaches “objective rules of morality express the
rational order of good and evil attested to by conscience

 it is by
the judgment of conscience that man perceives and recognizes the
prescriptions of the divine law” ¶1751 1778

conscience and vatican ii

some appeal to an ill‑defined “spirit of vatican ii” to support their
concept of the human conscience

 they use vague terms such as “renewal”
“reinvigoration” and “rejuvenation” of the church while consciously
misrepresenting what the documents of the council actually say

 they
often quote the vatican ii document dignitatis humanae “declaration on
religious freedom” in support of their contention that people should be
able to do anything their uneducated consciences do not object to

⁷

however this is obviously not what the fathers of vatican ii taught


they instead laid out very clearly the multiple dangers inherent in this
line of thinking

 in gaudium et spes they wrote “conscience frequently
errs from invincible ignorance without losing its dignity

 the same
cannot be said for a man who cares but little for truth and goodness or
for a conscience which by degrees grows practically sightless as a
result of habitual sin” ¶16‑17

 furthermore the document notes that
“not a few can be found who seem inclined to use the name of freedom as


the document continues by confirming an essential principle that the
conscience must submit itself to the authority of the church

 in forming their consciences the christian faithful must give careful
 attention to the sacred and certain teaching of the church

 for the
 catholic church is by the will of christ the teacher of truth

 her

 itself

 ¶14

conscience does have a very particular and necessary role given by god


as defined in romans 212‑16 and jeremiah 3133 god imprints the
natural law on the heart and soul of man and this leads him to know
whether or not an act is moral or evil

⁹ this means that the “natural
law” is man s instinctual knowledge of what is right and what is wrong ―
his “conscience

” however the conscience must work with the teachings
of the church never against it





the church as demonstrated in a particularly vivid manner by her
martyrs has always held that a person s properlyformed conscience may
never be violated

 countless men women and even children have
courageously stated “you may kill me but you will never force me to
violate my conscience

”

this principle has more recently been recognized by secular authorities



rights and its 1966 international covenant on civil and political
rights states that “everyone has the right to freedom of thought
conscience and religion

”

when society fails to acknowledge conscience as a human right and does
not provide protections for individuals to follow their own consciences
grave conflicts inevitably result

 either people will heroically obey
their consciences whatever the cost or they will lose their moral
integrity with all the devastating effects that flow from this on
society at large




tragically many catholics possess a fatally flawed concept of
conscience denying the need for formation in the truth and treating
mere desire as an absolute

 conscience is indeed a decisionmaker but
it must be freely submitted to the law of god to which it is a witness
not an arbiter



the error lies not in affirming the freedom of conscience to decide but
in misinterpreting the nature of such freedom

 freedom of conscience
must be at the service of moral truth but can never be its determinant

 principal


 the declaration does not base the right to the free exercise of
 religion on “freedom of conscience

” nowhere does this phrase occur


 and the declaration nowhere lends its authority to the theory for
 which the phrase frequently stands namely that i have the right to
 do what my conscience tells me to do simply because my conscience
 tells me to do it

 this is a perilous theory

 its particular peril is
 subjectivism ― the notion that in the end it is my conscience and
 not the objective truth which determines what is right and wrong
 true or false

 it
describes the fate of someone who does not guard or “keep” his
conscience hebrews 914 and 1 peter 316 and who allows his
conscience to become “seared” 1 timothy 42

 the bible also speaks of
a “weak conscience” 1 corinthians 87 a “wounded conscience” 1
corinthians 812 a “good” and “perfect” conscience hebrews 99 and
1318 1 peter 321 and 1 timothy 1519 a “clear” or blameless
conscience acts 2416 and 1 timothy 39 and a conscience that is
“evil” or defiled titus 115
