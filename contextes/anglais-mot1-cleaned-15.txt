being a leader of conscience

leadership

written by jon mertz

what does a leader of conscience mean

 it begins with character to avoid distorted values with a centered focus on virtues of humanity

 a leader of conscience engages in community conversations and identifies what virtues to act upon in the choices being made



sparked by professor richard shell s new book the conscience code i
explored what being conscience means

 it led me to the ethics centre a
nonprofit in sydney australia

 the ethics centre defines conscience
as


2

 how a person decides what is right

while conscience sounds simple it quickly gets complicated as we
encounter situations in which variables challenge us in what we believe
and what we decide is right

 in some cases our conscientious voice gets
it right immediately

 other times confusion reigns



our conscience and character are intimately linked



our character builds specific values and those values become engraved

virtues are attitudes dispositions or character traits that enable us
to be and to act in ways that develop this potential humanity

 the
development of humanity is crucial when considering our conscience and
how we decide what to do in challenging situations




conversation which leads to a focus beyond our selfinterests



connecting conscience to character and virtues is imperative



too often lately values are being distorted to protect a power base
rather than engaging the value in how it helps humanity

 making a switch
to virtues can raise the leadership standard

 a new conscience
accountability checklist

 after our conscience determines an approach ask what virtue
 supports the decision





we all need to engage in conversations about virtues and begin to raise
the standard of being a leader of conscience
