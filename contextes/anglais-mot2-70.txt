Consciousness shared by individuals within a society

Social consciousness or social awareness, is collective consciousness
shared by individuals within a society.^([1])

Social consciousness is linked to the collective self-awareness and
experience of collectively shared social identity.^([2]) From this
viewpoint, social consciousness denotes conscious awareness of being
part of an interrelated community of others. The “we feeling” or the
“sense of us” may be experienced in members of various cultures and
social groups. By the experience of collectively shared social identity,
individuals may experience social unity. Social consciousness may also
stimulate working towards a common goal.

  — the real foundation, on which rises a legal and political
  superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social
  consciousness. The mode of production of material life determines the
  social, political and intellectual life process in general. It is not
  the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the
  contrary, their social being that determines their
  consciousness."^([3])
