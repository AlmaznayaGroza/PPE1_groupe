how does the conscious differ from the conscience

 being conscious is
the state of being awake and alert

 conscience on the other hand
refers to an awareness of whether actions are right or wrong




at a glance

while the two terms are often confused the conscious and the conscience
refer to very different things

 your conscious allows you to be aware of
your place in the world while your conscience allows you to behave in
this world in morally and socially acceptable ways

 as described below
being conscious refers to your awareness of yourself and the world
around you

 your conscience is your ability to distinguish between what
is right and what is wrong



 what does conscience mean

 

your conscience is the part of your personality that helps you determine
right and wrong and keeps you from acting upon your most basic urges and
desires



your conscience is what makes you feel guilty when you do something bad
and good when you do something kind




even altruistic ways



in freudian theory the conscience is part of the superego that contains
information about what is viewed as bad or negative by your parents and
by society—all the values you learned and absorbed during your
upbringing

 the conscience emerges over time as you take in information
about what is considered right and wrong by your caregivers your peers
and the culture in which you live



caregiver s rules

 for example if a parent sets a rule a child could
learn a sense of right and wrong regarding that topic

 studies have also
examined other factors that may affect the way conscience develops
including the nature of the parentchild relationship style of parental
discipline and the child s temperament—but more research is needed



 breaking down the differences 

conscience

 noun


to further explain their differences here are examples of how the terms
conscience and conscious could be used in a sentence



 conscience 

they had a guilty conscience because they cheated on the test



the term conscience here describes this person s sense of what is right
and wrong and the subsequent feeling of guilt they have over cheating on
the test




when thinking about these two concepts just remember that conscious
means to be awake and aware while conscience refers to your inner sense
of right and wrong



 common uses 

 guilty conscience indicates that someone feels guilty about their
 actions
 clear conscience suggests that people 
 conscious of your words suggests that you are aware of the effect
 your words may have and thus choose them with caution



 aware

it s definitely easy to confuse the terms conscious and conscience
particularly when you hear the words spoken out loud

 however with the
help of some context clues and some attention to their spelling
