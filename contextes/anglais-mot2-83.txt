   Critical consciousness, conscientization, or conscientização in
   Portuguese (
   Portuguese pronunciation: [kõsjẽtʃizaˈsɐ̃w]), is a popular education
   and social concept developed by Brazilian pedagogue and educational
   theorist Paulo Freire, grounded in neo-Marxist critical theory.
   Critical consciousness focuses on achieving an in-depth understanding
   of the world, allowing for the perception and exposure of social and
   political contradictions. Critical consciousness also includes taking
   action against the oppressive elements in one's life that are
   illuminated by that understanding.^[1]

   The English term conscientization is a translation of the Portuguese
   term conscientização, which is also translated as "consciousness
   raising" and "critical consciousness". The term was popularized by
   Brazilian educator, activist, and theorist Paulo Freire in his 1970
   work Pedagogy of the Oppressed. Freire was teaching the poor and

   Paulo Freire defines critical consciousness as the ability to intervene
   in reality in order to change it.^[3] Critical consciousness proceeds
   through the identification of "generative themes", which Freire
   identifies as "iconic representations that have a powerful emotional
   impact in the daily lives of learners." In this way, individual
   consciousness helps end the "culture of silence" in which the socially
   dispossessed internalize the negative images of themselves created and
   propagated by the oppressor in situations of extreme poverty.
   Liberating learners from this mimicry of the powerful, and from the
   fratricidal violence that results therefrom is a major goal of critical
   consciousness. Critical consciousness is a fundamental aspect of
   Freire's concept of popular education.

   community cultural development. From the glossary of Goldbard's 2006
   book New Creative Community: "Conscientization is an ongoing process by
   which a learner moves toward critical consciousness. This process is
   the heart of liberatory education. It differs from "consciousness
   raising" in that the latter may involve transmission of preselected
   knowledge. Conscientization means engaging in praxis, in which one both

   The ancient Greeks first identified the essence of critical
   consciousness when philosophers encouraged their students to develop an
   "impulse and willingness to stand back from humanity and nature...
   [and] to make them objects of thought and criticism, and to search for
   their meaning and significance.^[5] In his books Pedagogy of the
   Oppressed^[6] and Education for Critical Consciousness,^[3] Freire
   explains critical consciousness as a sociopolitical educative tool that
   engages learners in questioning the nature of their historical and
   social situation, which Freire addressed as "reading the world". The
   goal of critical consciousness, according to Freire, should be acting
   as subjects in the creation of democratic society. In education, Freire
   implies intergenerational equity between students and teachers in which
--
   schools. The staff are minor actors, the "teacher" is an adviser and
   helps just when asked.^[10]^[11] The Sudbury model maintains that
   values, social justice, critical consciousness, intergenerational
   equity, and political consciousness included, must be learned through
   experience,^[12]^[13]^[14]^[15] as Aristotle said: "For the things we
   have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them."^[16]

   Picking up on Freire's definition of critical consciousness, Joe L.
   Kincheloe has expanded the definition of the concept in his work on
   postformalism. In Kincheloe's formulation postformalism connects
--
   ideological inscription, and a particular focus on the socio-political
   construction of the self. With these concerns in mind Kincheloe's
   postformal critical consciousness engages questions of purpose, issues
   of human dignity, freedom, authority, reconceptualized notions of
   reason, intellectual quality, and social responsibility. Postformal
   critical consciousness stimulates a conversation between critical
   pedagogy and a wide range of social, cultural, political economic,
   psychological, and philosophical concerns. Kincheloe employs this
   "multilogical conversation" to shape new modes of self-awareness, more
   effective forms of social, political, and pedagogical action, and an
   elastic model of an evolving critical consciousness (Kincheloe and
   Steinberg, 1993; Kincheloe, 1999; Thomas and Kincheloe, 2006).

   Freire's development of critical consciousness has been expanded upon
   in several academic disciplines and common applications.^[17] Public
   health community collaborations focused on HIV prevention for
   women,^[18] the role of critical consciousness in adult education,^[19]
   and the effect of peer pressure on cigarette smokers^[20] Freire's
   notion of critical consciousness is, in part, a type of political
   consciousness.

   In educational programs for youth and adolescents, some instructors
   have implemented curricula aimed at encouraging students to develop a
   critical consciousness within subject-specific material.^[21]
   Instructors can teach language arts,^[22] science,^[23] and social
   science^[24] lessons while guiding students to connect academic
--
   discuss these ideas collaboratively in the classroom.

   In application, raising critical consciousness in young students can
   lead to successful outcomes in terms of students' social-emotional
   well-being,^[25] academic performance,^[26] and increased pursuit of
   careers after completing high school.^[27]^[28] While some studies
   provide support for developing critical consciousness in students due
   to the potential benefits, other studies present conflicting results.
   For example, research has also shown that students who demonstrate
   lower critical consciousness levels may experience less depressed
   moods^[29] and higher grades.^[30] Due to limitations associated with
   the predominantly qualitative designs of many studies on critical
   consciousness in education, further research is needed using rigorous,
   controlled quantitative designs to more clearly understand the
   relationship between critical consciousness and young students’
   trajectory.^[21]
