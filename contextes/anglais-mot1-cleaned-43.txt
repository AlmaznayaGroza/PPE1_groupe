how sb 1580 defines right of medical conscience and free speech in
health care
by jeff scott esq

 fma general counsel july 20 2023


it is the intent of the legislature to provide the right of medical
conscience for health care providers and payors to ensure they can care
for patients in a manner consistent with their moral ethical and
religious convictions

 further it is the intent of the legislature that
licensed health care providers and payors be free from threat of
discrimination for providing consciencebased health care



this legislature coupled this “right of medical conscience” with a
provision protecting the “use of free speech by a health care
practitioner” to create a comprehensive legislative package that was a
priority of gov

 ron desantis

 this analysis of sb 1580 will attempt to
explain how these two new provisions affect the practice of medicine


right of medical conscience
sb 1580 creates a new section of the florida statutes¹ that gives health
care providers and health care payors the right to “opt out of
participation in or payment for any health care service on the basis of
a consciencebased objection

”
it is important to note that this right of conscience only applies to a
“health care service

” it does not give a health care provider the right
to refuse to perform job requirements that do not involve the provision

performed or provided by any health care provider



if a health care provider has a consciencebased objection to performing
abortions the provider may not be discriminated against or suffer
adverse action for refusing to perform abortions

 however a provider

patients based on the patient s race color religion sex or national
origin


the right of conscience is solely attached to a specific health care
service

 a provider can refuse to prescribe contraceptives to hisher
patients but cannot refuse to prescribe contraceptives to only medicaid

procedure to hisher patients may not refuse to provide that procedure
to a subset of patients who engage in a certain type of behavior even
if the provider has a consciencebased objection to that behavior


while the bill sponsors made it clear as to what the right of conscience
applies to they left the issue of whether a conscientious objection
exists less certain

 sb 1580 defines a “consciencebased objection” as
an objection based on a sincerely held religious moral or ethical
belief

² as noted in the footnote whether an entity such as an
insurance company has a conscience is determined by existing written
evidence

 if the articles of incorporation for an insurer state that the
company exists to provide health insurance for individuals whose

federal requirement

 if the company cannot produce a governing
document published guideline or set of policies or regulations it
will not be entitled to assert a right of conscience


individual health care providers³ on the other hand do not have to
produce written evidence attesting to a sincerely held religious moral

general as the entity given enforcement authority for this statute to
determine whether a health care provider alleging a violation has a
valid consciencebased objection

 presumably the attorney general will
assess a provider s selfprofessed belief on a casebycase basis in a
manner congruent with the inquiry used for similar laws such as title

accommodation for employee s sincerely held religious beliefs


health care providers and payors who wish to opt out of participation in
or payment for a health care service due to a consciencebased objection
must do the following


 patient s medical file


 notify patients seeking an appointment for a health care service
 that the provider has a consciencebased objection to of that
 objection before scheduling the appointment


 providers who are students must provide written notice of their
 consciencebased objection to the educational institution at the
 time the objection is made or as soon as practicable



providers who comply with these requirements may not be discriminated
against⁴ or suffer adverse action⁵ for exercising their right of medical
conscience


the right of medical conscience section also includes speech and
whistleblower protections which prohibit discriminating or taking
adverse action against health care providers or payors who report
violations of the new right of medical conscience statute

 this
protection is extended to providers who testify assist or participate
in a proceeding brought by the attorney general to determine if a

interestingly this part of the new law also includes a prohibition on
discriminating against a health care provider or payor for reasons not
related to the right of medical conscience

 protection from
discrimination is extended to the disclosure of information the provider
or payor reasonably believes constitutes

under the original house companion to sb 1580 health care providers and
payors were given a civil cause of action for any violation of the right
of conscience section

 sb 1580 however rejected this approach in favor
of allowing the attorney general to investigate complaints and bring a
civil action for damages injunctive or other appropriate relief and
attorney fees


health care providers and payors who decline to participate in or pay
for a health care service because of a consciencebased objection may
not be held civilly liable on that basis alone


finally acknowledging the existence of federal emtala requirements the
legislature specifically stated that the medical conscience section does
not override any state or federal requirement to provide emergency
medical treatment



1184

 despite support from the governor the bills never made it to the
house or senate floor

 the free speech concept in a different form was
combined with the right of conscience issue in sb 1580 passed out of
both chambers and was approved by the governor less than a week after
the end of session



¹ section 381

00321 florida statutes 2023


² health care payors and other entities such as insurance companies and
hospitals can also have consciencebased objections as determined by
reference to the entities governing documents published ethical moral
or religious guidelines or directives mission statements
