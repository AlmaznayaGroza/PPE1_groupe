Article 6 Moral Conscience

MORAL CONSCIENCE

1776 "Deep within his conscience man discovers a law which he has not
laid upon himself but which he must obey. Its voice, ever calling him to
love and to do what is good and to avoid evil, sounds in his heart at
the right moment.... For man has in his heart a law inscribed by God....
His conscience is man's most secret core and his sanctuary. There he is
alone with God whose voice echoes in his depths."⁴⁷
