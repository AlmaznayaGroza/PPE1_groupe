medieval theories of conscience

first published tue jan 19 2021

consideration however has been devoted to what was believed to link
the psychological to the metaethical the mental habit or act of
conscience and its sisterconcept of synderesis though interest in
the subject has recently seen a modest resurgence e

what is the scope and nature of this apparent ability to intuitively
grasp right from wrong

 can conscience err and if so do its dictates
still bind

 the best way to address these and other questions is to
employ a developmental approach

 the term conscience is still generally
used to refer to an innate moral sense but it has slightly different
connotations today than it did in the medieval period which in turn had
different connotations from what preceded it in pagan antiquity and in
scripture

 still medieval theories of conscience drew extensively on
these earlier sources

 since the concepts of conscience and synderesis
evolved over time then it will be necessary to take a linear approach
to the topic and begin with some background

1 the ancient context judicial conscience

to understand the medieval theory of conscience it is essential to
examine its etymology

 unlike most philosophical categories that are
central to medieval thought the concept of conscience did not have its
origins in plato or aristotle potts 1982 687

 rather most scholars
agree it originated in the greek playwrights of the fifth century bce

1961 5



the english word “conscience” is derived from the latin conscientia

 its
greek equivalent is syneidesis

 both terms connote a state or act of
“sharing knowledge with oneself” sorabji 2014 12

 this knowledge is

objects in the outside world but can also “turn back on” reflectere or
become an object to themselves

 as c

 s

 lewis put it in his study of
the concept of concept of conscience in the western tradition

 man might be defined as a reflexive animal

 a person cannot help

 also sorabji 2014 12

lewis refers to this primarily pagan understanding of conscience as an
“inner witness”

 it does not judge our actions as right or wrong but
merely testifies to their existence

 some other way

 lewis 1960 190

others however regard the sort of conscience that lewis describes here
as a type of internal judge and therefore refer to it as “judicial
conscience” d arcy 1961 8

 while this property of the mind does not
necessarily issue binding rules it does pass moral judgements on our
deeds

 it would however eventually take on the role of issuing moral
dictates for future acts as well

 eric d arcy refers to this later form
of syneidesis or conscientia as the “legislative conscience” whose
innovator he argues was the apostle paul ca

 5 ce–ca

most important founder of the christian faith after jesus of nazareth

 paul legislative conscience

the judicial understanding of conscience continued well into the first
century of the common era

 to be sure paul himself continued to employ
it

 at the same time d arcy credited paul with introducing in addition
to the “judicial conscience” a novel conception he termed the
“legislative conscience”

 it is not difficult to see why the earlier
judicial conception would later take on legislative features

 this is
because the ability to judge past actions as either right or wrong—and

 by the law they are a law for themselves even though they do not
 have the law

 they show that the requirements of the law are written
 on their hearts their consciences also bearing witness and their
 thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending
 them

 romans 214–15 niv

latter was later glossed as a reference to the natural law which is
accessible to all people nonjews included and is consistent with the
mosaic law

 notice that according to the foregoing passage conscience
syneidesis is not the ultimate source of right and wrong

 rather the
foundation of right and wrong is the objective moral law which is both
“written on men s hearts” and borne witness to by conscience



one might say then that the objective norm of morality on paul s
account is the moral law or natural law

 conscience however might be
termed morality s subjective norm

 this is made clear in another passage
from st

 paul where he is addressing the question of whether it is

since “food does not bring us near to god—we are no worse if we do not
eat and no better if we do” 1 corinthians 88 niv

 still even
though the consciences of such christians are erroneous they must
follow them since conscience paul suggests is a rule of conduct
romans 1413–23

 eric d arcy sums up these two important contributions
of st

 paul as follows

 st

 paul then introduces an entirely new phase in the history of the
 term “conscience” in moral theory and two new features characterize
 his use of it

 first it is to play a directive role before action
 takes place

 in the pagan writers conscience did not appear on the
 scene until after the action was performed and its role was purely
 judicial but in st

 paul conscience is credited with a legislative
 function and it induces an obligation in the proper sense

 second
 conscience is fallible the directions it issues may be mistaken but
 whether it be mistaken or not it seems that we are bound to follow
 its rulings

 d arcy 1961 11–12

in sum we might follow sorabji s suggestion that this phase in the
development of the concept of conscience—that is from its origins in
fifthcentury bce greek literature to the firstcentury ce—has eight
features sorabji 2014 36

 jerome the invention of synderesis

that conscience was so central a concept in st

 paul s writings
guaranteed it an important place in the moral theology of the greek and
latin fathers especially st

 basil john damascene and st

 ambrose



and the ox s face the appetitive part cf

 plato republic 436b–441b


what did the eagle represent

 according to jerome it represented that
“spark of conscience” scintilla conscientiae which makes us aware of
our sinfulness when reason spirit or desire become disordered

 medieval
manuscripts refer to this psychological property as synderesis or

 now above these three was the eagle so in the soul they say above
 the other three elements and beyond them is a fourth which the greeks
 call synderesis

 this is that spark of conscience which was not
 quenched even in the heart of cain when he was driven out of
 paradise

 this it is that which makes us too feel our sinfulness

 by sham reason

 it is natural to identify synderesis with the eagle
 since it is distinct from the other three elements and corrects them
 when they err however we also see that this conscience
 conscientia is cast down in some people who have neither shame nor
 insight regarding their offences and loses its place 

 commentary

however he does admit the existence of those who are shameless and
lacking in moral insight

 such people are oblivious to their offenses
because according to jerome their conscience conscientia ceases to
be present in them “looses its place”

 if synderesis cannot be lost
but conscience can then it seems to follow that they are separate
properties of the soul

 in any case whatever jerome s intention this
curious passage was indirectly handed down to the middle ages via the

1 peter lombard the scholastic origins of the debate

peter lombard s role in the evolution of the concept of conscience is
both surprising and unsurprising

 it is—at first sight
anyway—surprising because lombard does not discuss conscience or
synderesis in any actual detail

 indeed he does not strictly speaking
mention the terms “synderesis” or “conscience” at all

 what he does is
merely to allude to jerome s commentary on ezekiel in the context of
discussing the will s role in how rational agents can naturally want


lombard s brief mention of jerome s “spark of reason” sic in the
aforementioned passage is the full extent of his treatment of conscience
and synderesis

 still that was sufficient to ensure that it would
receive robust attention by later scholastics who would track down the

turned to jerome s text in order to scrutinize the original passage


there they discovered his apparent distinction between synderesis and
conscience which in turn would come to frame the parameters of the
later medieval debate

 if synderesis and conscience are in fact two
separate parts of the soul for instance what is their relationship to
one another

 what come to that are their respective natures and

stephen langton 1155–1228 regent master of theology at paris and
later archbishop of canterbury is important in the present context less
for any systematic treatment of conscience—indeed stephen scarcely
touches on the issue at all—than for his somewhat scattered views on
synderesis

 the relevant treatment comes in stephen s quaestiones

1948 113

 d arcy sums up langton s position as follows

 remorse of conscience is the work not of synderesis but of reason
 for synderesis remains at the level of general principles whereas
 reason descends to the concrete case but it is precisely over the
 concrete case that remorse of conscience is felt hence it is by
 reason and not by synderesis that we sin

 d arcy 1961 23–24


as we will see influence later thinkers such as aquinas

3 philip the chancellor the first systematic treatment of synderesis and conscience

although stephen langton was the first scholastic to touch on the issue
of synderesis in any depth it was philip the chancellor ca

 1170–1237
who wrote the first treatise devoted to exploring the relationship
between synderesis and conscience lottin 1948 139–157

 as chancellor
of notre dame philip had the right to grant the license to teach in the
theology faculty at paris and it was under his tenure that the

for the former and one for the latter

 although primarily an
administrator philip was also a trained theologian

 his most important
work is the summa de bono which includes the treatise on conscience



in his treatise philip sets out to answer several questions related to

who apparently share the view that synderesis is a faculty of the soul
independent of the others philip the chancellor summa de bono
treatise on conscience potts trans

 1980 95–96



against the claim that synderesis is a power of the soul philip

 is a disposition arising naturally in conjunction with that
 potentiality by which the natural will is directed to what is good
 without qualification

 summa de bono treatise on conscience potts
 trans

 1980 96


 potentiality or a disposition the right answer lies in taking
 something in between a dispositional potentiality

 summa de bono
 treatise on conscience potts trans

 1980 97

it would seem then that synderesis is a potentiality albeit an

philip puts it synderesis is that which “murmurs back against sin and
correctly contemplates and wants what is good without qualification”
summa de bono treatise on conscience potts trans

 1980 100



on the matter of conscience and how it is related to synderesis philip
distinguishes them

 for one thing conscience can be mistaken while
synderesis cannot

 specifically conscience is the result of a
concurrence of synderesis with free decision liberum arbitrium

 put
otherwise it is the specific application of a general moral principle
that is the outcome of deliberation

 when correctly applied conscience
is correct

 when incorrectly applied it errs

 in either case the
judgement of conscience generates a moral obligation to act

 philip uses
the following example of how synderesis which is always right can
nonetheless conjoin with an erring conscience potts 1980 104

1

 unerring universal premise of synderesis “everyone who falsely

2

 erring minor premise of reason “this christ fellow is falsely
 claiming to be the son of god”


3

 erring judgement of conscience “therefore this christ fellow should
 be put to death”

from the foregoing example it is clear that synderesis delivers a
general nondeliberative proposition while conscience yields what
potts calls a particular “deontic proposition”

 the laterscholastic tradition

1 st

 bonaventure conscience as cognitivesynderesis as affective

one of the most prominent representatives of the franciscan intellectual

faculty a position he held until 1257

 his commentary on the sentences
is the fruit of these lectures and it is in this work that he discusses
the topics of conscience and synderesis

 for bonaventure we not only
possess innate moral knowledge but we also have an inextinguishable
inclination towards achieving the good

 our inborn knowledge of the
former that is of the natural law is associated with conscience
which resides in the intellect while our inclination towards desiring
the good is associated with synderesis which inheres in the will



what is the ontological status of conscience

 according to bonaventure
just as theologians have disagreed over the nature of “thought”
defining it variously as the power of thinking a habit or an
apprehended principle of knowledge so too have they differed over how
to define “conscience” conscientia

 most commonly however the term
has been used to refer to a cognitive habit or disposition that relates
to the practical as opposed to the theoretical intellect

 indeed it is


 theoretical knowledge perfects our thought to the extent that the
 latter is theoretical whereas conscience is a disposition perfecting
 our thought to the extent that it is practical or to the extent that
 it directs us towards deeds

 bonaventure commentary on the

is such a disposition innate or acquired

 it is possible according to
bonaventure to find authorities on both sides of the debate

 for the
opinion that conscience is innate bonaventure cites among other
authorities st

 paul s famous reference to a moral law that is “written
on men s hearts” in romans 114–15

 he also appeals to a “natural
instinct to seek blessedness and to honor one s parents” commentary
on the sentences 2

 2 mcgrade trans

 2001 175–176

 for
the opinion that conscience is not innate on the other hand
bonaventure cites aristotle s claim that the soul is a blank slate


bonaventure s solution is to find a middle position between st

 paul on
the one hand and aristotle on the other

 his conclusion conscience is
part innate part acquired




principles of practical reason

 this innate capacity to immediately
grasp such principles as true or not in the realm of practical reason is
called conscience

 it is associated for bonaventure with the
augustinian “natural light”—or “natural tribunal”—that is built into the
structure of the mind and which permits rational agents to intuitively

and mother” and “do not harm thy neighbour”



in what sense though is conscience acquired

 although the ability to
judge the deontic propositions of the natural law as selfevidently true
is innate it does not follow that the contents of such propositions are

 trans

 1980 113

conscience then is partly innate and partly acquired with respect to
the content of the natural law

 but what is the relationship of such
universal premises to the conclusions of practical reason

 how does the

note that conscience does not simply move from the general to the
particular with respect to concrete actions

 it also moves from the
general to the specific with respect to propositions themselves

 as

120

 although the distinction between basic and derived deontic
propositions is potts and although the case cited is an example of an
erroneous conscience bonaventure argues that male circumcision and the
prohibition on eating pork are no longer applicable it accurately sums
up bonaventure s distinction between propositions that are “very clearly


this distinction between basic or very general principles and specific
or derived precepts is germane to the question of whether conscience can
ever be mistaken and if so whether in such cases it continues to bind


bonaventure s response is that we can never be mistaken about basic

sometimes err since

 although conscience is always right so long as it sticks to the
 general and is moved by simple inspection it can become mistaken when
 it descends to particulars and brings things together because the

 the sentences 2

 1980 120

is one obliged to always follow one s conscience

 it depends since
conscience is fallible

 if what it dictates is in accordance with god s
will then one is obliged to follow it on pain of eternal damnation

 if
erroneous—if what it dictates is contrary to the divine will—as is
sometimes the case when applying basic deontological principles then
conscience does not bind

 rather the agent has an obligation to correct
the error in order to bring his conscience into line with the natural
law

 if he does not and follows his erroneous conscience he commits a
mortal sin

what it tells us or binds us to change it” commentary on the sentences

 obviously then the
intellect plays an important role in achieving happiness given its
possession of conscience

 but what of the will

 does it not have an
equally important role to play in the moral life

 yes in its possession
of synderesis

 in line with tradition bonaventure calls synderesis the
“spark of conscience” commentary on the sentences 2

39 a

 2 mcgrade
trans

 2001 186

 he breaks with tradition however in arguing that it
inheres in the will rather than in the intellect

 indeed synderesis for
bonaventure is precisely the counterpart of conscience insofar as the
will like the intellect has an innate inclination towards the moral
as opposed to the useful good

 in the case of the intellect this
disposition takes the form of the “natural light” of conscience that
apprehends the first principles of the natural law in the case of the
will it takes the form of synderesis a “natural bias” towards desiring
the moral good

 there is one sense however in which synderesis is not
exactly analogous to conscience

 while it looks very much like a habit
synderesis is rather according to bonaventure presumably following
philip the chancellor a habitlike power of the soul commentary on

pleasure or is so stubbornly persistent in their depravity that they
cannot reorient themselves towards the good

 still when synderesis
follows the innate judgement of conscience with respect to basic deontic
principles which can never err then it too functions correctly because
that is its natural state

 it has the potential to go wrong and fall

the agent sins

2 st thomas aquinas synderesis and conscience as cognitive

thomas aquinas 122425–1274 is by any measure one of the most
important if not the most important scholastic theologian of the later
middle ages

 although his views on conscience and synderesis have
received less attention in recent years than his theory of natural law
this is unjustified

 for the scholastics a full account of morality

knowledge of right and wrong



aquinas discussed the issues of synderesis and conscience in several of
his major works from his early commentary on the sentences and the de
veritate to his mature summa theologica see d arcy 1961 36–47

 as

“habitlike faculty”

 aquinas as might be expected hews much closer to
his dominican mentor and teacher albert the great ca

 1200–1280 for
whom both synderesis and conscience belong to the intellect see
dougherty 2018 221




object of the practical intellect is the good “under the aspect of
truth” thomas aquinas summa theologica i q

 79 a

 11 ad

synderesis and conscience for aquinas both belong to the practical
intellect




like speculative reasoning practical reasoning generally takes a
deductive form

 just as science is the conclusion of the demonstrative
syllogism so conscience is the conclusion of a practical syllogism

 the
practical syllogism like the demonstrative syllogism contains a major
premise a minor premise and a conclusion

 the major premise is drawn or

and minor premises a conclusion is drawn that generates a moral
obligation to act hoffmann 2012 258

 this inferential judgment is
associated for aquinas with conscience an act—as opposed to a faculty
or a habit—that includes a number of applications such as “to witness
to bind or incite and also to accuse torment or rebuke” thomas
aquinas summa theologica i q

 79 a

 13 corp





conscience acts as a “witness” when it is consciously aware of some
personal wrongdoing whether of commission or omission

 it “binds” or
“incites” when it makes a judgement that some act should be performed


finally it “accuses” “torments” or “rebukes” when it judges that some
past action was either morally acceptable or it was not

 although it is
difficult to see how conscience in the first sense—conscience as
witness—can function as an application of knowledge to conduct this
seems less problematic in the second and third senses of the term which
harken back to the legislative and judicial senses of conscience found
in st

 paul and pagan antiquity respectively d arcy 1961 46

 in any
case an example of the way in which conscience applies the natural
law—whose principles are apprehended by synderesis— is articulated in
aquinas s de veritate

 higher reason presents this minor premise “sexual intercourse with
 this woman is forbidden by the law of god” the application of
 conscience will be made by concluding “this sexual intercourse is to
 be avoided”

 de veritate q

 17 a

 2 corp

 cited in dougherty
 2018 222

now the dictates of conscience can either be right if correctly deduced
from the natural law or wrong if they are incorrectly deduced

 the
dictates of the former are the product of a “correct conscience” and the
judgements of the latter are the result of an “erroneous conscience”


since synderesis is infallible the main source of an erroneous
conscience when it does occur is the agent s adoption of a faulty
minor premise in the practical syllogism de veritate q

 17 a

trans

 1980 132–133



now it is clear that we have an obligation to follow a correct
conscience since to do so contributes to achieving our final end

 but
what of an erroneous conscience

 does this have any authority

 for
aquinas an erring conscience also binds

 it does not however
necessarily excuse

 as hoffmann puts it

 regardless of whether my action is objectively good evil or
 indifferent conscience binds for it is by means of conscience that
 an action is proposed to me as good bad or indifferent

 hoffmann
 2012 260

refrains

 according to aquinas this agent although he does what is
objectively right nonetheless sins

 why

 because in choosing the
opposite of what his conscience dictated he chose to do something he
believed to be evil

 and choosing what is subjectively if not
objectively wrong for aquinas is a sin “f from the very fact that

thereto becomes evil” summa theologica iii q

 19 a

 5 corp





what follows from this is that conscience whether right or erroneous
always binds

 as to the question of whether an erroneous conscience
excuses on the other hand that depends on the type of ignorance that
causes it

 this is because some types of ignorance render an act

 theologica iii q

 19 a

 6 corp



ignorance that contributes to an erroneous conscience that is in any way
voluntary is vincible or able to be corrected and therefore culpable
if followed

 this generally happens where the agent s ignorance of the

unfortunately as we have seen such precepts are of a very general
character such as “do good and avoid evil”

 for such general knowledge
to be applicable by conscience it must be further specified

 this
further specification comprises the secondary precepts of the natural
law which are closely drawn from the former precepts and from natural


a final problem seems to emerge are we not according to aquinas s
account of the erroneous conscience left with the possibility of a
moral dilemma

 for if we have an obligation to always follow our
consciences but we sometimes sin when we do follow them then it seems
that we are sometimes put into a double bind

 we seem that is to
sometimes have conflicting obligations so that regardless of what we do
we sin

 aquinas s solution is that it is only wrong to follow a
conscience that is in a state of vincible ignorance

 since such
ignorance is by definition correctable we can always resolve the
apparent dilemma by choosing to put aside our ignorance

 as far as
acting from invincible ignorance is concerned we are pardoned

3 william of ockham new directions in the understanding of synderesis and conscience

with the fourteenthcentury theologian william of ockham 1285–1347 we
encounter some radically new developments on the topics of synderesis
and conscience

 while ockham s franciscan predecessor john duns scotus
had disagreements with aquinas about the nature of the moral law scotus
fundamentally agreed with the dominican in viewing synderesis and
conscience a habit and an act of the practical reason respectively
whose jobs were to apprehend the basic principles of morality in the
case of synderesis and to apply them in the case of conscience john
duns scotus ordinatio 2 d

 39 wolter trans

 1997 162–163

 like
scotus ockham also agrees with aquinas in several crucial respects



tradition which preceded him however is in his abandonment of the
concept of synderesis and in his unique approach to the invincibly
erroneous conscience



it is difficult to know for certain why ockham abandoned the concept of

moral epistemology was pinckaers assumption that because ockham
discarded the traditional notion of synderesis he must have done the
same for its twin concept of conscience

 pinckaers conceded that moral
principles even if rooted in the divine will still need to be applied
to particular situations on ockham s account

 this role was of course
reserved for conscience in the earlier tradition

 in ockham according
to pinckaers this role now became associated with practical reason and
prudence pinckaers 1993 259



a closer reading of the textual evidence suggests that ockham very much
made use of the traditional concept of conscience

 indeed much of how
he employed the concept was consistent with the tradition especially as
articulated by aquinas

 ockham associates the dictates of practical
reason for example with judgements of conscience

 he is also emphatic
in his belief that rational agents have an absolute obligation to follow
their consciences which can be correct or erroneous quaestiones
variae q

 8 a

 1 oth 8 411

 a conscience is correct when it is in
accord with right reason it is erroneous when it is not

 finally an
erroneous conscience for ockham as with aquinas is either in a state
of vincible—voluntary and therefore culpable—ignorance or in a state of
invincible—or involuntary—ignorance

 where conscience is in a state of
vincible ignorance we must do our best to set it aside

 in all these
cases ockham follows the tradition with one exception that of the
invincibly erroneous conscience eardley 2013 94–98 the state in
which the agent finds himself with the correct universal principles but
nonculpably errs with respect to his grasp of the circumstances in


in what sense does ockham depart from the tradition

 for ockham the act
of following an invincibly erroneous conscience is not merely excusable
as it was for aquinas but “virtuous and meritorious”

 consider the
following example from ockham

 while walking down the street one day you

determine that although it is theoretically possible that he could be
fraud this seems unlikely

 for ockham you are obliged in this instance
to follow your conscience and indeed you do

 it turns out however
that this apparent homeless person is in fact a very wealthy person who
is impersonating a beggar

 for ockham in following your conscience you
are not merely excused or absolved of your error but your ignorant
act is virtuous and indeed regarded by god as meritorious so long

 indeed had he not while in such error willed to help that person
 he would have performed a vicious and demeritorious act because such
 an act would have been knowingly elicited against conscience and
 against nonculpable reason because in the aforementioned case he
 does not know that he is in error but believes that he possesses right


what is motivating ockham s novel suggestion

 even aquinas admitted that
we have an obligation to follow our consciences whether right or
erroneous

 when we do not do so according to aquinas we sin

 of
course when our consciences are in a state of voluntary or vincible
ignorance we also have a duty to put aside our error otherwise we sin


it is obviously not possible however to put error aside in the case of
invincible ignorance since such ignorance is by definition involuntary


accordingly for aquinas we are obliged to follow such a conscience


although we act wrongly in such cases we are for aquinas excused on
the grounds that we could not have known better

 to return to aquinas s

such an act might be considered virtuous much less meritorious

 but for
ockham if it is vicious and therefore punishable not to follow an
invincibly erroneous conscience then merely being excused for following
it when we are under a moral obligation to do so would be an
insufficient reward

 rather it should logically follow that it is
