Few
novelists
have
captured
the
ultimate
ambiguity
of
conscience
better
than
Mark
Twain
did
in
Huckleberry
Finn
.


Jim
,
the
escaped
slave
who
accompanies
Huck
down
the
river
on
a
raft
,
is
on
a
journey
to
reunite
with
his
beloved
family
(whom
white
people
have
separated
from
him
)
.


In
several
scenes
,
Huck
,
beset
with
guilt
for
not
handing
Jim
over
to
the
authorities
as
his
conscience
naggingly
instructs
him
to
,
anguishes
over
his
default
role
as
an
escapee
'
s
accomplice
.



---------------
concerned
father
figure
he
never
had
but
in
many
ways
as
a
paragon
of
virtue
,
despite
the
color
of
his
skin
,
Huck
decides
to
disobey
his
conscience
.


In
doing
so
,
he
demonstrates
the
courage
many
literary
critics
have
cited
as
constituting
the
novel
'
s
moral
climax
:

---------------


It
don
'
t
make
no
difference
whether
you
do
right
or
wrong
,
a
person
'
s

conscience
ain
'
t
got
no
sense
,
and
just
goes
for
him
anyway
.



But
because
Huck
isn
'
t
yet
mature
or
free-thinking
enough
to
triumph
---------------
freedom—which
,
despite
tremendous
personal
risks
,
Jim
so
desperately
seeks
because
of
his
dedication
to
his
wife
and
children—would
be
to
mirror
his
society
'
s
corrupted
conscience
.


Huck
'
s
safeguarding
of
Jim
from
all
the
people
who
'
d
prefer
(primarily
for
ignoble
reasons
)
to
return
him
to
slavery
can
be
comprehended
as
depicting
a
true
versus
an
artificial
,
culturally-derived
conscience
.



Ernest
Hemingway
,
deeply
influenced
by
Twain
'
s
plain-spoken
style
and
---------------
definitions
of
morality
as
simplistic—and
frequently
false
.



Defining
conscience
from
a
religious
perspective

Let
'
s
now
look
at
customary
definitions
of
conscience
to
illustrate
how
they
stop
short
of
accounting
for
the
many
ambiguities
so
often
found
in
reality
,
for
what
'
s
ideal
and
what
'
s
practically
possible
can
at
times
---------------

The
literature
online
relating
particularly
to
the
oxymoronic
concept
of
an
evil
conscience
emanates
mostly
from
theology—and
we
'
ll
deal
with
this
orientation
first
.


The
approach
that
fundamentalist
religion
takes
toward
ethics
is
absolutist
,
placing
a
person
'
s
behavior
into
neat
,
---------------
all
of
its
supporting
evidence
from
Scriptures
,
Greg
Stuckey
defines
any
human
wrongdoing
as—purely
and
simply—evil
.


So
anyone
afflicted
with
such
a
presumed
immoral
conscience
will
experience
as
good
what
the
Bible
delineates
as
evil
,
and
vice
versa
.



---------------
precisely
what
they
should
be
ashamed
of
.


Rather
than
feeling
troubled
by
hurting
others
,
they
perversely
take
joy
in
it
.


Looked
at
from
this
dogmatic
ecclesiastical
stance
,
an
evil
conscience
is
synonymous
with
sinning
against
God—and
it
requires
paying
penance
to
God
if
one
is
to
be
forgiven
.
