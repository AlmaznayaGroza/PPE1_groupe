key points

 the ambiguous nature of conscience is welldramatized in mark
 twain s huckleberry finn


 according to hemingway we should trust our authentic feelings

 apart—as is the gulf between what people aspire to and what they re
 capable of


 from an ecclesiastical perspective an evil conscience is synonymous
 with sinning against god and one must pay penance to be forgiven

few novelists have captured the ultimate ambiguity of conscience better
than mark twain did in huckleberry finn

 jim the escaped slave who
accompanies huck down the river on a raft is on a journey to reunite
with his beloved family whom white people have separated from him

 in
several scenes huck beset with guilt for not handing jim over to the
authorities as his conscience naggingly instructs him to anguishes over
his default role as an escapee s accomplice




concerned father figure he never had but in many ways as a paragon of
virtue despite the color of his skin huck decides to disobey his
conscience

 in doing so he demonstrates the courage many literary
critics have cited as constituting the novel s moral climax



 it don t make no difference whether you do right or wrong a person s
 conscience ain t got no sense and just goes for him anyway



but because huck isn t yet mature or freethinking enough to triumph

freedom—which despite tremendous personal risks jim so desperately
seeks because of his dedication to his wife and children—would be to
mirror his society s corrupted conscience

 huck s safeguarding of jim
from all the people who d prefer primarily for ignoble reasons to
return him to slavery can be comprehended as depicting a true versus an
artificial culturallyderived conscience



ernest hemingway deeply influenced by twain s plainspoken style and

definitions of morality as simplistic—and frequently false



defining conscience from a religious perspective

let s now look at customary definitions of conscience to illustrate how
they stop short of accounting for the many ambiguities so often found in
reality for what s ideal and what s practically possible can at times


the literature online relating particularly to the oxymoronic concept of
an evil conscience emanates mostly from theology—and we ll deal with
this orientation first

 the approach that fundamentalist religion takes
toward ethics is absolutist placing a person s behavior into neat

all of its supporting evidence from scriptures greg stuckey defines any
human wrongdoing as—purely and simply—evil

 so anyone afflicted with
such a presumed immoral conscience will experience as good what the
bible delineates as evil and vice versa




precisely what they should be ashamed of

 rather than feeling troubled
by hurting others they perversely take joy in it

 looked at from this
dogmatic ecclesiastical stance an evil conscience is synonymous with
sinning against god—and it requires paying penance to god if one is to
be forgiven
