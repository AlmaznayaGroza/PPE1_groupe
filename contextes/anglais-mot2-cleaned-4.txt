What
Is
Consciousness
?




Your
consciousness
refers
to
your
conscious
experiences
,
your
individual
awareness
of
your
own
internal
thoughts
,
feelings
,
memories
,
and
sensations
.



Consciousness
is
often
thought
of
as
a
stream
,
constantly
shifting
according
to
the
ebb
and
flow
of
your
thoughts
and
experiences
of
the
world
around
you
.



"Consciousness
is
generally
defined
as
awareness
of
your
thoughts
,
actions
,
feelings
,
sensations
,
perceptions
,
and
other
mental
processes
,"

In
other
words
,
they
say
,
this
suggests
that
consciousness
isn
'
t
just
one
mental
process
but
rather
a
part
of
many
.


"For
example
,
memories
can
be
conscious
,
but
consciousness
is
not
just
memory
.


Perceptions
can
be
conscious
,
but
consciousness
is
not
just
perception
.

"

The
conscious
and
consciousness
can
be
difficult
to
pin
down
.


As
psychologist
and
philosopher
William
James
once
explained
,
"Its
meaning
we
know
so
long
as
no
one
asks
us
to
define
it
.
