[Waking
class
consciousness
today
]

 
---------------
in
10
voters
with
a
family
income
under
$50
,000
voted
for
a
man
who
promised
to
repeal
the
Affordable
Care
Act
.


This
fact
alone
shows
that
the
working
class
is
not
woke
enough
.


Raising
class
consciousness
should
be
a
top
priority
for
left
activists
,
and
we
need
more
ways
to
do
it
.



---------------
less
widely
portrayed
on
TV
.


As
access
to
production
and
distribution
mechanisms
opens
up
,
activists
should
seize
opportunities
to
create
representations
that
further
class
consciousness
.


We
can
also
draw
attention
to
images
that
do
exist
and
help
people
interpret
their
meaning
.


---------------
Granted
,
not
all
revolutionary
battles
happen
in
the
realm
of
ideology
.


Material
struggles
over
economic
structures
and
political
power
are
ultimately
more
important
.


But
raising
class
consciousness
means
finding
allies
so
that
material
struggles
can
be
waged
and
won
.


We
need
to
identify
spaces
within
ideology
where
working-class
identity
is
being
---------------
movement
in
the
1970s
.


At
that
time
,
it
was
common
for
women
not
to
feel
solidarity
with
other
women
,
and
not
to
accept
that
sexism
was
real
.


Feminists
brought
women
together
in
“consciousness
raising”
groups
to
share
their
experiences
.


“I
have
never
been
subjected
to
sexism
,”
a
woman
might
say
.


“I
do
have
varicose
veins
from
wearing
high
heels
,
a
---------------

Strong
working-class
identification
provides
the
unifying
factor
that
makes
other
aspects
of
identity
a
matter
of
diversity

The
same
method
might
work
to
raise
class
consciousness
.


In
a
diverse
group
,
facilitators
could
ask
whether
participants
have
ever
been
injured
at
work
,
whether
they
are
able
to
save
money
,
take
time
off
for
---------------
pro-capitalist
ideological
forces
must
take
place
within
ideology
.


In
addition
to
critique
,
we
need
positive
representations
of
working-class
identity
to
raise
class
consciousness
and
compete
with
the
far
right
.
