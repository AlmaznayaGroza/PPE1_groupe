Consciousness
,
at
its
simplest
,
is
awareness
of
internal
and
external
existence
.

^([1])
However
,
its
nature
has
led
to
millennia
of
analyses

explanations

and

by
philosophers

and
theologians

Opinions

In
some
explanations

it

About

definition
of
consciousness

Scholars
are
divided
as
to
whether
Aristotle
had
a
concept
of
consciousness
.


He
does
not
use
any
single
word
or
terminology
that
is
clearly
similar
to
the
phenomenon
or
concept
defined
by
John

Victor
Caston

that
Aristotle
did
have
a
concept
more
clearly
similar

Philosophers
have
used
the
term
consciousness
for
four
main
topics
:

knowledge
in
general
,
intentionality
,
introspection
(and
the

knowledge
it
specifically
generates)
and

experience

layers
"which

past

^([24]

)
By
1875
,
most
psychologists
believed
that
"consciousness
was
but
a
small
part
of
mental
life"
,^([24]
:

and
this
idea

Prime

were
phrases
like

personal
consciousness
:


The
first
and

will

the
fact
that

is
one
of
the
terms

.


Its
meaning

so
long
as

asks
us

to
give
an

accurate
account

it

Prior
to
the
20th
century
,
philosophers
treated
the
phenomenon
of
consciousness
as
the
"inner
world
[of]
one
'
s
own
mind"
,
and
introspection
was
the
mind
"attending
to"
itself
,^([b])
an
activity
seemingly
distinct
from
that
of
perceiving
the

'
outer
world
'

and
its
---------------

doubted
.


The
outer
world
,
but
never
the
inner
world
,
has
been
denied
.



Everyone
assumes
that
we
have
direct
introspective
acquaintance
with

our
thinking
activity
as
such
,
with
our
consciousness
as
something

inward
and
contrasted
with
the
outer
objects
which
it
knows
.


Yet
I

must
confess
that
for
my
part
I
cannot
feel
sure
of
this
conclusion
.



[

It
seems
as
if
consciousness
as
an
inner
activity
were
rather
a

postulate
than
a
sensibly
given
fact
.


.


.

^([25]
:
467
)

By
the
1960s
,
for
many
philosophers
and
psychologists
who
talked
about
consciousness
,
the
word
no
longer
meant
the

'
inner
world
'

but
an
indefinite
,
large
category
called
awareness
,
as
in
the
following
example
:


It
is
difficult
for
modern
Western
man
to
grasp
that
the
Greeks
really

had
no
concept
of
consciousness
in
that
they
did
not
class
together

phenomena
as
varied
as
problem
solving
,
remembering
,
imagining
,

perceiving
,
feeling
pain
,
dreaming
,
and
acting
on
the
grounds
that
all
---------------
a
skeptical
attitude
more
than
a
definition
:


Consciousness—The
having
of
perceptions
,
thoughts
,
and
feelings
;

awareness
.


The
term
is
impossible
to
define
except
in
terms
that
are

unintelligible
without
a
grasp
of
what
consciousness
means
.


Many
fall

into
the
trap
of
equating
consciousness
with
self-consciousness—to
be

conscious
it
is
only
necessary
to
be
aware
of
the
external
world
.



Consciousness
is
a
fascinating
but
elusive
phenomenon
:
it
is

impossible
to
specify
what
it
is
,
what
it
does
,
or
why
it
has
evolved
.



Nothing
worth
reading
has
been
written
on
it
.

^([29])

Using

'
awareness
'

,
however
,
as
a
definition
or
synonym
of
consciousness
is
not
a
simple
matter
:


If
awareness
of
the
environment
.


.


.


is
the
criterion
of

consciousness
,
then
even
the
protozoans
are
conscious
.


If
awareness
of

awareness
is
required
,
then
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
great
apes
and

human
infants
are
conscious
.

^([26])
---------------
[edit]

Many
philosophers
have
argued
that
consciousness
is
a
unitary
concept
that
is
understood
by
the
majority
of
people
despite
the
difficulty
philosophers
have
had
defining
it
.

^([30])
Max
Velmans
proposed
that
the
"everyday
understanding
of
consciousness"
uncontroversially
"refers
to
experience
itself
rather
than
any
particular
thing
that
we
observe
or
experience"
and
he
added
that
consciousness
"is
[therefore]
exemplified
by
all
the
things
that
we
observe
or
experience"
,^([31]
:
4
)
whether
thoughts
,
feelings
,
or
perceptions
.


Velmans
noted
however
,
as
of
2009
,
that
there
was
a
deep
level
of
"confusion
and
internal
division"^([31])
among
experts
about
the
phenomenon
of
consciousness
,
because
researchers
lacked
"a
sufficiently
well-specified
use
of
the
term
.


.


.

to
agree
that
they
are
investigating
the
same
thing"
.

^([31]
:
3
)
He
argued
additionally
that
"pre-existing
theoretical
commitments"
to
competing
explanations
of
consciousness
might
be
a
source
of
bias
.



Within
the
"modern
consciousness
studies"
community
the
technical
phrase

'
phenomenal
consciousness
'

is
a
common
synonym
for
all
forms
of
awareness
,
or
simply

'
experience
'

,^([31]
:
4
)
without
differentiating
between
inner
and
outer
,
or
between
higher
and
lower
types
.


With
---------------
phenomenology
to
its
associated
information
processing"
in
the
brain
.

^([31]
:
10
)
This
neuroscientific
goal
is
to
find
the
"neural
correlates
of
consciousness"
(NCC)
.


One
criticism
of
this
goal
is
that
it
begins
with
a
theoretical
commitment
to
the
neurological
origin
of
all
"experienced
phenomena"
whether
inner
or
outer
.

^([c])
Also
,
the
fact
that
the
easiest

'
content
of
consciousness
'

to
be
so
analyzed
is
"the
experienced
three-dimensional
world
(the
phenomenal
world)
beyond
the
body
surface"^([31]
:
4
)
invites
another
criticism
,
that
most
consciousness
research
since
the
1990s
,
perhaps
because
of
bias
,
has
focused
on
processes
of
external
perception
.

^([33])

From
a
history
of
psychology
perspective
,
Julian
Jaynes
rejected
popular
but
"superficial
views
of
consciousness"^([2]
:
447
)
especially
those
which
equate
it
with
"that
vaguest
of
terms
,
experience"
.

^([24]
:
8
)
In
1976
he
insisted
that
if
not
for
introspection
,
which
for
decades
had
been
ignored
or
taken
for
granted
rather
than
explained
,
there
could
be
no
"conception
of
what
consciousness
is"^([24]
:
18
)
and
in
1990
,
he
reaffirmed
the
traditional
idea
of
the
phenomenon
called

'
consciousness
'

,
writing
that
"its
denotative
definition
is
,
as
it
was
for
René
Descartes
,
John
Locke
,
and
David
Hume
,
what
is
introspectable"
.

^([2]
:
450
)
Jaynes
saw
consciousness
as
an
important
but
small
part
of
human
mentality
,
and
he
asserted
:
"there
can
be
no
progress
in
the
science
of
consciousness
until 
.


.


.


what
is
introspectable
[is]
sharply
distinguished"^([2]

from
the
unconscious
processes
of
cognition
such
as
perception
,
reactive
---------------
The
cognitive
science
point
of
view—with
an
inter-disciplinary
perspective
involving
fields
such
as
psychology
,
linguistics
and
anthropology^([34])—requires
no
agreed
definition
of
"consciousness"
but
studies
the
interaction
of
many
processes
besides
perception
.


For
some
researchers
,
consciousness
is
linked
to
some
kind
of
"selfhood"
,
for
example
to
certain
pragmatic
issues
such
as
the
feeling
of
agency
and
the
effects
of
regret^([33])
and
action
on
experience
of
one
'
s
own
body
---------------

Some
have
argued
that
we
should
eliminate
the
concept
from
our
understanding
of
the
mind
,
a
position
known
as
consciousness
semanticism
.

^([38])

In
medicine
,
a
"level
of
consciousness"
terminology
is
used
to
describe
a
patient
'
s
arousal
and
responsiveness
,
which
can
be
seen
as
a
continuum
of
states
ranging
from
full
alertness
and
comprehension
,
through
disorientation
,
delirium
,
loss
of
meaningful
communication
,
and
finally
loss
of
movement
in
response
to
painful
stimuli
.

^([39])
Issues
of
practical
concern
include
how
the
level
of
consciousness
can
be
assessed
in
severely
ill
,
comatose
,
or
anesthetized
people
,
and
how
to
treat
conditions
in
which
consciousness
is
impaired
or
disrupted
.

^([40])
The
degree
or
level
of
consciousness
is
measured
by
standardized
behavior
observation
scales
such
as
the
Glasgow
Coma
Scale
.



---------------

While
historically
philosophers
have
defended
various
views
on
consciousness
,
surveys
indicate
that
physicalism
is
now
the
dominant
position
among
contemporary
philosophers
of
mind
.

^([41])
For
an
overview
of
the
field
,
approaches
often
include
both
historical
perspectives
---------------

Philosophers
differ
from
non-philosophers
in
their
intuitions
about
what
consciousness
is
.

^([42])
While
most
people
have
a
strong
intuition
for
the
existence
of
what
they
refer
to
as
consciousness
,^([30])
skeptics
argue
that
this
intuition
is
too
narrow
,
either
because
the
concept
of
consciousness
is
embedded
in
our
intuitions
,
or
because
we
all
are
illusions
.


Gilbert
Ryle
,
for
example
,
argued
that
traditional
understanding
of
consciousness
depends
on
a
Cartesian
dualist
outlook
that
improperly
distinguishes
between
mind
and
body
,
or
between
mind
and
world
.


He
proposed
that
we
speak
not
of
minds
,
bodies
,
and
the
world
,
but
of
entities
,
or
identities
,
acting
in
the
world
.


Thus
,
by
speaking
of
"consciousness"
we
end
up
leading
ourselves
by
thinking
that
there
is
any
sort
of
thing
as
consciousness
separated
from
behavioral
and
linguistic
understandings
.

^([43])

---------------
[edit]

Ned
Block
argued
that
discussions
on
consciousness
often
failed
to
properly
distinguish
phenomenal
(P-consciousness)
from
access
(A-consciousness)
,
though
these
terms
had
been
used
before
Block
.

^([44])
P-consciousness
,
according
to
Block
,
is
raw
experience
:
it
is
moving
,
colored
forms
,
sounds
,
sensations
,
emotions
and
feelings
with
our
bodies
and
responses
at
the
center
.


These
experiences
,
considered
independently
of
any
impact
on
behavior
,
are
called
qualia
.


A-consciousness
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
the
phenomenon
whereby
information
in
our
minds
is
accessible
for
verbal
report
,
reasoning
,
and
the
control
of
behavior
.


---------------
conscious
,
and
so
on
.


Although
some
philosophers
,
such
as
Daniel
Dennett
,
have
disputed
the
validity
of
this
distinction
,^([45])
others
have
broadly
accepted
it
.


David
Chalmers
has
argued
that
A-consciousness
can
in
principle
be
understood
in
mechanistic
terms
,
but
that
understanding
P-consciousness
is
much
more
challenging
:
he
calls
this
the
hard
problem
of
consciousness
.

^([46])

Some
philosophers
believe
that
Block
'
s
two
types
of
consciousness
are
not
the
end
of
the
story
.


William
Lycan
,
for
example
,
argued
in
his
book
Consciousness
and
Experience
that
at
least
eight
clearly
distinct
types
of
consciousness

that
even
this

more
obscure
forms

^([47])

There
is
also
debate
over
whether
or
not
A-consciousness
and
P-consciousness
always
coexist
or
if
they
can
exist
separately
.


Although
P-consciousness
without
A-consciousness
is
more
widely
accepted
,
there
have
been
some
hypothetical
examples
of
A
without
P
.


Block
,
for
instance
,
suggests
the
case
of
a
"zombie"
that
is
computationally
identical
to
a
person
but
without
any
subjectivity
.


However
,
he
remains
somewhat
skeptical
concluding
"I
don
'
t
know
whether
there
are
any
actual
cases
of
A-consciousness
without
P-consciousness
,
but
I
hope
I
have
illustrated
their
conceptual
possibility"
.

Distinguishing
consciousness
from
its
contents

[edit]

Sam
Harris
observes
:
"At
the
level
of
your
experience
,
you
are
not
a
body
of
cells
,
organelles
,
and
atoms
;
you
are
consciousness
and
its
ever-changing
contents"
.

^([49])
Seen
in
this
way
,
consciousness
is
a
subjectively
experienced
,
ever-present
field
in
which
things
(the
contents
of
consciousness)
come
and
go
.



Christopher
Tricker
argues
that
this
field
of
consciousness
is
symbolized
by
the
mythical
bird
that
opens
the
Daoist
classic
the
Zhuangzi
.


This
bird
'
s
name
is
Of
a
Flock
(peng
鵬)
,
yet
its
back
is
countless
thousands
of
miles
across
and
its
wings
are
like
clouds
arcing
across
the
heavens
.


"Like
Of
a
Flock
,
whose
wings
arc
across
the
heavens
,
the
wings
of
your
consciousness
span
to
the
horizon
.


At
the
same
time
,
the
wings
of
every
other
being
'
s
consciousness
span
to
the
horizon
.


You
are
of
a
flock
,
one
bird
among
kin
.

Mental
processes
(such

consciousness)
and
physical
processes
(such
as
brain
events)
seem
to
be
correlated
,
however
the
specific
nature
of
the
connection
is
unknown
.


---------------
The
first
influential
philosopher
to
discuss
this
question
specifically
was
Descartes
,
and
the
answer
he
gave
is
known
as
mind–body
dualism
.


Descartes
proposed
that
consciousness
resides
within
an
immaterial
domain
he
called
res
cogitans
(the
realm
of
thought)
,
in
contrast
to
the
domain
of
material

which

solutions
can
be
divided
broadly
into
two
categories
:
dualist
solutions
that
maintain
Descartes
'
s
rigid
distinction
between
the
realm
of
consciousness
and
the
realm
of
matter
but
give
different
answers
for
how
the
two
realms
relate
to
each
other
;
and
monist
solutions
that
maintain
that
there
is
really
only
one
realm
of
being
,
of
which
consciousness
and
matter
are
both
aspects
.


Each
of
these
categories
itself
contains
numerous
variants
.


The
two
main
types
of
dualism
are
substance
dualism
---------------
Since
the
dawn
of
Newtonian
science
with
its
vision
of
simple
mechanical
principles
governing
the
entire
universe
,
some
philosophers
have
been
tempted
by
the
idea
that
consciousness
could
be
explained
in
purely
physical
terms
.


The
first
influential
writer
to
propose
such
an
idea
explicitly
was
Julien
Offray
de
La
Mettrie
,
in
his
book
Man
a
Machine
(L
'
homme
machine)
.


His
arguments
,
however
,
were
very
abstract
.

^([55])
The
most
influential
modern
physical
theories
of
consciousness
are
based
on
psychology
and
neuroscience
.


Theories
proposed
by
neuroscientists
such
as
Gerald
Edelman^([56])
and
Antonio
Damasio
,^([57])
and
by
philosophers
such
as
Daniel
Dennett
,^([58])
seek
to
explain
consciousness
in
terms
of
neural
events
occurring
within
the
brain
.


Many
other
neuroscientists
,
such
as
Christof
Koch
,^([59])
have
explored
the
neural
basis
of
consciousness
without
attempting
to
frame
all-encompassing
global
theories
.


At
the
same
time
,
computer
scientists
working
in
the
field
of
artificial
intelligence
have
pursued
the
goal
of
creating
digital
computer
programs
that
can
simulate
or
embody
consciousness
.

^([60])

A
few
theoretical
physicists
have
argued
that
classical
physics
is
intrinsically
incapable
of
explaining
the
holistic
aspects
of
consciousness
,
but
that
quantum
theory
may
provide
the
missing
ingredients
.


Several
theorists
have
therefore
proposed
quantum
mind
(QM)
theories
of
consciousness
.

^([61])
Notable
theories
falling
into
this
category
include
the
holonomic
brain
theory
of
Karl
Pribram
and
David
Bohm
,
and
the
Orch-OR
theory
formulated
by
Stuart
Hameroff
and
Roger
Penrose
.


Some
of
these
QM
theories
offer
descriptions
of
phenomenal
consciousness
,
as
well
as
QM
interpretations
of
access
consciousness
.


None
of
the
quantum
mechanical
theories
have
been
confirmed
by
experiment
.


Recent
publications
by
G

Guerreshi
,
J
.


Cia
,

Popescu
,
and
---------------
scientists
and
philosophers
consider
the
arguments
for
an
important
role
of
quantum
phenomena
to
be
unconvincing
.

^([63])
Empirical
evidence
is
against
the
notion
of
quantum
consciousness
,
an
experiment
about
wave
function
collapse
led
by
Catalina
Curceanu
in
2022
suggests
that
quantum
consciousness
,
as
suggested
by
Roger
Penrose
and
Stuart
Hameroff
,
is
highly
implausible
.

^([64])

Apart
from
the
general
question
of
the
"hard
problem"
of
consciousness
(which
is
,
roughly
speaking
,
the
question
of
how
mental
experience
can
arise
from
a
physical
basis^([65]))
,
a
more
specialized
question
is
how
---------------

Many
philosophers
consider
experience
to
be
the
essence
of
consciousness
,
and
believe
that
experience
can
only
fully
be
known
from
the
inside
,
subjectively
.


The
problem
of
other
minds
is
a
philosophical
problem
traditionally
stated
as
the
following
epistemological
question
:
---------------
principle
to
have
an
entity
that
is
physically
indistinguishable
from
a
human
being
and
behaves
like
a
human
being
in
every
way
but
nevertheless
lacks
consciousness
.

^([67])
Related
issues
have
also
been
studied
extensively
by
Greg
Littmann
of
the
University
of
Illinois
,^([68])
and
by
Colin
Allen
(a
professor
at
the
University
of
Pittsburgh)
regarding
---------------
androids
.

^([69])

The
most
commonly
given
answer
is
that
we
attribute
consciousness
to
other
people
because
we
see
that
they
resemble
us
in
appearance
and
behavior
;
we
reason
that
if
they
look
like
us
and
act
like
us
,
they
must
---------------
understand
what
they
are
saying
.

^([71])
More
broadly
,
philosophers
who
do
not
accept
the
possibility
of
zombies
generally
believe
that
consciousness
is
reflected
in
behavior
(including
verbal
behavior)
,
and
that
we
attribute
consciousness
on
the
basis
of
behavior
.


A
more
straightforward
way
of
saying
this
is
that
we
attribute
experiences
to
people
because
of
what
they
can
do
,
including
the
fact
that
they
can
---------------
The
philosopher
and
scientist
Daniel
Dennett
describes
them
as
"the
way
things
seem
to
us"
,
while
philosopher
and
cognitive
scientist
David
Chalmers
expanded
on
qualia
as
the
"hard
problem
of
consciousness"
in
the
1990s
.


When
qualia
is
experienced
,
activity
is
simulated
in
the
brain
,
and
these
processes
are
called
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
(NCCs)
.


Many
scientific
studies
have
been
done
to
attempt
to
link
particular
brain
regions
with
emotions
or
experiences
.

^([73][74][75])
---------------
[edit]

For
many
decades
,
consciousness
as
a
research
topic
was
avoided
by
the
majority
of
mainstream
scientists
,
because
of
a
general
feeling
that
a
phenomenon
defined
in
subjective
terms
could
not
properly
be
studied

The
Science
and
Religion
Forum^([78])
1984
annual
conference
,

'
From
Artificial
Intelligence
to
Human
Consciousness
'

identified
the
nature
of
consciousness
as
a
matter
for
investigation
;
Donald
Michie
was
a
keynote
speaker
.


Starting
in
the
1980s
,
an
expanding
community
of
neuroscientists
and
psychologists
have
associated
themselves
with
a
field
called
Consciousness
Studies
,
giving
rise
to
a
stream
of
experimental
work
published
in
books
,^([79])
journals
such
as
Consciousness
and
Cognition
,
Frontiers
in
Consciousness
Research
,
Psyche
,
and
the
Journal
of
Consciousness
Studies
,
along
with
regular
conferences
organized
by
groups
such
as
the
Association
for
the
Scientific
Study
of
Consciousness^([80])
and
the
Society
for
Consciousness
Studies
.



Modern
medical
and
psychological
investigations
into
consciousness
are
based
on
psychological
experiments
(including
,
for
example
,
the
investigation
of
priming
effects
using
subliminal
stimuli)
,^([81])
and
on
case
studies
of
alterations
in
consciousness
produced
by
trauma
,
illness
,
or
drugs
.


Broadly
viewed
,
scientific
approaches
are
based
on
two
core
concepts
.


The
first
identifies
the
content
of
consciousness
with
the
experiences
that
are
reported
by
human
subjects
;
the
second
makes
use
of
the
concept
of
consciousness
that
has
been
developed
by
neurologists
and
other
medical
professionals
who
deal
with
patients
whose
behavior
is
impaired
.


In
either
case
,
the
ultimate
goals
are
to
develop
techniques
for
assessing
consciousness
objectively
in
humans
as
well
as
other
animals
,
and
to
understand
the
neural
and
psychological
mechanisms
that
underlie
it
.

The
Necker

,
an
ambiguous
image

Experimental
research
on
consciousness
presents
special
difficulties
,
due
to
the
lack
of
a
universally
accepted
operational
definition
.


In
the
majority
of
experiments
that
are
specifically
about
consciousness
,
the
subjects
are
human
,
and
the
criterion
used
is
verbal
report
:
in
other
words
,
subjects
are
asked
to
describe
their
experiences
,
and
their
descriptions
are
treated
as
observations
of
the
contents
of
consciousness
.

^([82])

For
example
,
subjects
who
stare
continuously
at
a
Necker
cube
usually
---------------

Verbal
report
is
widely
considered
to
be
the
most
reliable
indicator
of
consciousness
,
but
it
raises
a
number
of
issues
.

^([85])
For
one
thing
,
if
verbal
reports
are
treated
as
observations
,
akin
to
observations
in
other
branches
of
science
,
then
the
possibility
arises
that
they
may
---------------
Another
issue
with
verbal
report
as
a
criterion
is
that
it
restricts
the
field
of
study
to
humans
who
have
language
:
this
approach
cannot
be
used
to
study
consciousness
in
other
species
,
pre-linguistic
children
,
or
people
with
types
of
brain
damage
that
impair
language
.


As
a
third
issue
,
philosophers
who
dispute
the
validity
of
the
Turing
test
may
feel
that
it
is
possible
,
at
least
in
principle
,
for
verbal
report
to
be
dissociated
from
consciousness
entirely
:
a
philosophical
zombie
may
give
detailed
verbal
reports
of
awareness
in
the
absence
of
any
genuine
awareness
.

^([88])

Although
verbal
report
is
in
practice
the
"gold
standard"
for
ascribing
consciousness
,
it
is
not
the
only
possible
criterion
.

^([85])
In
medicine
,
consciousness
is
assessed
as
a
combination
of
verbal
behavior
,
arousal
,
brain
activity
,
and
purposeful
movement
.


The
last
three
of
these
can
be
used
as
indicators
of
consciousness
when
verbal
behavior
is
absent
.

^([89][90])
The
scientific
literature
regarding
the
neural
bases
of
arousal
and
purposeful
movement
is
very
extensive
.


Their
reliability
as
indicators
of
consciousness
is
disputed
,
however
,
due
to
numerous
studies
showing
that
alert
human
subjects
can
be
induced
to
behave
purposefully
in
a
variety
of
ways
in
spite
of
reporting
a
complete
lack
of
awareness
.

^([84])
Studies
related
to
the
neuroscience
of
free
will
have
also
shown
that
the
influence
consciousness
has
on
decision-making
is
not
always
straightforward
.

Schema
of
the
neural
processes
underlying
consciousness
,
from
Christof
Koch

A
major
part
of
the
scientific
literature
on
consciousness
consists
of
studies
that
examine
the
relationship
between
the
experiences
reported
by
subjects
and
the
activity
that
simultaneously
takes
place
in
their
brains—that
is
,
studies
of
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
.


The
hope
is
to
find
that
activity
in
a
particular
part
of
the
brain
,
or
a
particular
pattern
of
global
brain
activity
,
which
will
be
strongly
---------------

Another
idea
that
has
drawn
attention
for
several
decades
is
that
consciousness
is
associated
with
high-frequency
(gamma
band)
oscillations
in
brain
activity
.


This
idea
arose
from
proposals
in
the
1980s
,
by
Christof
von
der
Malsburg
and
Wolf
Singer
,
that
gamma
---------------
information
represented
in
different
parts
of
the
brain
into
a
unified
experience
.

^([98])
Rodolfo
Llinás
,
for
example
,
proposed
that
consciousness
results
from
recurrent
thalamo-cortical
resonance
where
the
specific
thalamocortical
systems
(content)
and
the
non-specific
(centromedial
thalamus)
thalamocortical
systems
(context)
interact
in
---------------

A
number
of
studies
have
shown
that
activity
in
primary
sensory
areas
of
the
brain
is
not
sufficient
to
produce
consciousness
:
it
is
possible
for
subjects
to
report
a
lack
of
awareness
even
when
areas
such
as
the
primary
visual
cortex
(V1)
show
clear
electrical
responses
to
a
---------------
Modulation
of
neural
responses
may
correlate
with
phenomenal
experiences
.


In
contrast
to
the
raw
electrical
responses
that
do
not
correlate
with
consciousness
,
the
modulation
of
these
responses
by
other
stimuli
correlates
surprisingly
well
with
an
important
aspect
of
consciousness
:
namely
with
the
phenomenal
experience
of
stimulus
intensity
(brightness
,
contrast)
.


In
the
research
group
of
Danko
Nikolić
it
has
been
shown
that
some
of
the
changes
in
the
subjectively
perceived
---------------
sleep
or
in
a
locked-in
state
than
in
those
who
are
in
deep
sleep
or
in
a
vegetative
state
,^([108])
making
it
potentially
useful
as
a
quantitative
assessment
of
consciousness
states
.



Assuming
that
not
only
humans
but
even
some
non-mammalian
species
are
conscious
,
a
number
of
evolutionary
approaches
to
the
problem
of
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
open
up
.


For
example
,
assuming
that
birds
are
conscious—a
common
assumption
among
neuroscientists
and
ethologists
due
to
the
extensive
cognitive
repertoire
of
birds—there
are
comparative
neuroanatomical
ways
to
validate
some
of
the
principal
,
currently
competing
,
mammalian
consciousness–brain
theories
.


The
rationale
for
such
a
comparative
study
is
that
the
avian
brain
deviates
structurally
from
the
mammalian
brain
.


So
how
similar
are
they
?


What
homologs
can
be
---------------
al
.

^([109])
is
that
some
of
the
major
theories
for
the
mammalian
brain^([110][111][112])
also
appear
to
be
valid
for
the
avian
brain
.


The
structures
assumed
to
be
critical
for
consciousness
in
mammalian
brains
have
homologous
counterparts
in
avian
brains
.


Thus
the
main
portions
of
the
theories
of
Crick
and
Koch
,^([110])
Edelman
and
Tononi
,^([111])
and
Cotterill
^([112])
seem
to
be
compatible
with
the
assumption
that
birds
are
conscious
.


Edelman
also
differentiates
between
what
he
calls
primary
consciousness
(which
is
a
trait
shared
by
humans
and
non-human
animals)
and
higher-order
consciousness
as
it
appears
in
humans
alone
along
with
human
language
capacity
.

^([111])
Certain
aspects
of
the
three
theories
,
however
,
seem
less
easy
to
apply
to
the
hypothesis
of
avian
consciousness
.


For
instance
,
the
suggestion
by
Crick
and
Koch
that
layer
5
neurons
of
the
mammalian
brain
have
a
special
role
,
seems
difficult
to
apply
to
the
avian
brain
,
since
the
avian
homologs
have
a
different
morphology
.


Likewise
,
the
theory
of
Eccles^([113][114])
seems
incompatible
,
since
a
structural
homolog/analogue
to
the
dendron
has
not
been
found
in
avian
brains
.


The
assumption
of
an
avian
consciousness
also
brings
the
reptilian
brain
into
focus
.


The
reason
is
the
structural
continuity
between
avian
and
reptilian
brains
,
meaning
that
the
phylogenetic
origin
of
consciousness
may
be
earlier
than
suggested
by
many
leading
neuroscientists
.

Global

theory
(GWT)
is
a
cognitive
architecture
and
theory
of
consciousness
proposed
by
the
cognitive
psychologist
Bernard
Baars
in
1988
.


Baars
explains
the
theory
with
the
metaphor
of
a

with

processes
represented
by
an

.


This

---------------

Integrated
information
theory
(IIT)
,
pioneered
by
neuroscientist
Giulio
Tononi
in
2004
,
postulates
that
consciousness
resides
in
the
information
being
processed
and
arises
once
the
information
reaches
a
certain
level
of
complexity
.


Additionally
,
IIT
is
one
of
the
only
leading
theories
of
consciousness
that
attempts
to
create
a
1
:1
mapping
between
conscious
states
and
precise
,
formal
mathematical
descriptions
of
those
mental
states
.


Proponents
of
this
model
suggest
that
it
may
provide
a
physical
grounding
for
consciousness
in
neurons
,
as
they
provide
the
mechanism
by
which
information
is
integrated
.


This
also
relates
to
the
"hard
problem
of
consciousness"
proposed
by
David
Chalmers
.


The
theory
remains
controversial
,
because
of
its
lack
of
credibility

Projective

model

[edit]

In

,
work
by
David
Rudrauf
and
colleagues
,
including
Karl
Friston
,
applied
the
active
inference
paradigm
to

,
leading
to
the
projective
consciousness
model
(PCM)
,
a
model
of
how
sensory
data
is
integrated
with
priors
in
a
process
of
projective
transformation
.


The
authors
argue
that
,
while
their
model
identifies
a
key
relationship
between
computation
and
phenomenology
,
it
does
not
completely
solve

Claustrum
being
the
conductor
for
consciousness

[edit]

The
proposal
is
backed
by
a
study
done
in
2014
,
where
a
team
at
the
George
Washington
University
induced
unconsciousness
in
a
54-year-old
woman
suffering
from
intractable
epilepsy
by
stimulating
her
claustrum
.


The
woman
underwent
depth
electrode
implantation
and
electrical
stimulation
mapping
.


The
electrode
between
the
left
claustrum
and
anterior-dorsal
insula
was
the
one
which
induced
unconsciousness
.


Correlation
for
interactions
affecting
medial
parietal
and
posterior
frontal
channels
during
stimulation
increased
significantly
as
well
.


Their
findings
suggested
that
the
left
claustrum
or
anterior
insula
is
an
important
part
of
a
network
that
subserves
consciousness
,
and
that
disruption
of
consciousness
is
related
to
increased
EEG
signal
synchrony
within
frontal-parietal
networks
.


However
,
this
remains
an
isolated

hence
inconclusive
study

The
emergence
of
consciousness
during

remains
a
topic
of
ongoing
scientific
inquiry
.


The
survival
value
of
consciousness
is
still
a
matter
of
exploration
and
understanding
.


While
consciousness
appears
to
play
a
crucial
role
in

cognition

and

,
its
adaptive
significance
across

Some
people
question
whether

has
any
survival

Some
argue
that
consciousness
is
a
by-product
of

Thomas
Henry
Huxley
for
example
defends
in
an
essay
titled
"On
the
Hypothesis
that
Animals

Automata
,
and

History"
an
epiphenomenalist
theory
of
consciousness
,
according
to
which
consciousness
is
a
causally
inert
effect
of
neural
activity—"as
the
steam-whistle

by
stating
an

argument
for
mind-brain
interaction
implying
that
if
the
preservation
and
development
of
consciousness
in
the
biological
evolution
is
a
result
of
natural
selection
,
it
is
plausible
that
consciousness
has
not
only
been
influenced
by
neural
processes
,
but
has
had
a
survival
value
itself
;
and
it

also
stresses
the
importance
of
the
evolutionary
emergence
of
higher-order
consciousness
in
humans
from
the
historically
older
trait
of
primary
consciousness
which
humans
share
with
non-human
animals
(see
Neural

section
above)
.


These
theories
of
integrative
function
present
solutions
to
two
classic
problems
associated
with
consciousness
:
differentiation
and
unity
.


They
show
how
our
conscious
experience
can
discriminate
between
a
virtually
unlimited
number
of
different
possible
scenes
and
details
(differentiation)
because
it
integrates
those
details
from
our
sensory
systems
,
while
the
integrative
nature
of
consciousness
in
this
view
easily
explains
how
our
experience
can
seem
unified
as
one
whole
despite
all
of
these
individual
parts
.


However
,
it
remains
unspecified
which
kinds
of
information
are
integrated
in
a
conscious
manner
and
which
kinds
can
be
integrated
without

.


Nor
is
it
explained
what
specific
causal
role
conscious
integration
plays
,
nor
why
the
same
functionality
cannot
be
achieved
without
consciousness

Not
all
kinds
of
information
are

and

be

and
combined
with
other
kinds
without

,
as
in
intersensory
interactions
such
as
the
ventriloquism
effect
.

^([142])
Hence
it
remains
unclear
why
any
of
it
is
conscious
.


For
a
review
of
the
---------------
article
of
Ezequiel
Morsella
.

^([142])

As
noted
earlier
,
even
among
writers
who
consider
consciousness
to
be
well-defined
,
there
is
widespread
dispute
about
which
animals
other
than
humans
can
be
said
to
possess
it
.

^([143])
Edelman
has
described
this
distinction
as
that
of
humans
possessing
higher-order
consciousness
while
sharing
the
trait
of
primary
consciousness
with
non-human
animals
(see
previous
paragraph)
.


Thus
,
any
examination
of
the
evolution
of
consciousness
is
faced
with
great
difficulties
.


Nevertheless
,
some
writers
have
argued
that
consciousness
can
be
viewed
from
the
standpoint
of
evolutionary
biology
as
an
adaptation
in
the
sense
of
a
trait
that
increases
fitness
.

^([144])
In
his
article
"Evolution
of
consciousness"
,
John
Eccles
argued
that
special
anatomical
and
physical

gave
rise
to
consciousness

^([145])
Bernard
Baars
proposed
that
once

this
"recursive"
circuitry
may
have
provided
a
basis
for
the
subsequent
development
of
many
of
the
functions
that
consciousness
facilitates
in
higher
organisms
.

^([146])
Peter
Carruthers
has
put
forth
one
such
potential
adaptive
advantage
gained
by
conscious
creatures
by
suggesting
that
consciousness
allows
an
individual
to
make
distinctions
between
appearance
and
reality
.

^([147])
This
ability
would
enable
a
creature
to
recognize
the
likelihood
that

cooperative
and
devious
ends

Other
philosophers
,
however
,
have
suggested
that
consciousness
would
not
be
necessary
for
any
functional
advantage
in
evolutionary
processes
.

^([148][149])

one
has
given

explanation

to
the
difference

and

,
it
is
unclear
what
adaptive
advantage
consciousness
could
provide
.

^([150])
As
a
result
,
an
exaptive
explanation
of
consciousness
has
gained
favor
with
some
theorists
that
posit
consciousness
did
not
evolve
as
an
adaptation
but
was
an
exaptation
arising
as
a
consequence
of
other
developments
such
as
increases
in

size
or

rearrangement

Consciousness
in

compared

The
medical
approach
to
consciousness
is
scientifically
oriented
.


It
derives
from
a
need
to
treat
people
whose
brain
function
has
been
impaired
as
a
result
of
disease
,
brain
damage
,
toxins
,
or
drugs

In
medicine
,
conceptual
distinctions
are
considered
useful
to
the
degree
that
they
can
help
to
guide
treatments
.


The
medical
approach
focuses
mostly
on
the
amount
of
consciousness
a
person
has
:
in
medicine
,
consciousness
is
assessed
as
a
"level"
ranging
from
coma
and
brain
death
at
the
low
end
,
to
full
alertness
and
purposeful
responsiveness
at
the
high
end
.

^([163])

Consciousness
is
of
concern
to
patients
and
physicians
,
especially
neurologists
and
anesthesiologists
.


Patients
may
have
disorders
of
consciousness
or
may
need
to
be
anesthetized
for

surgical
procedure
.


Physicians
may
perform
consciousness-related
interventions
such
as
instructing
the
patient
to
sleep
,
administering
general
anesthesia
,
or
inducing
medical
coma
.

Also
,
bioethicists
may
be
concerned
with
the
ethical
implications
of
consciousness
in
medical
cases
of
patients
such
as
the
Karen
Ann
Quinlan
case
,^([164])
while

may
study
patients
with
impaired
consciousness
in
hopes
of
gaining
information
about
how
the

works

[edit]

In
medicine
,
consciousness
is
examined
using
a
set
of
procedures
known
as
neuropsychological
assessment
.

^([89])
There
are
two
commonly
used
methods
for
assessing
the
level
of
consciousness
of
a
patient
:
a

minimal
training

complex
procedure

The

the
timing

Citing

Nelson

point
to
the
acquisition
of
"theory

calling
theory

"necessary
for

defining
it
as

On

eminent

different
branches

gathered
at

to
celebrate

deals

After

the

summarizes

findings

"We

The

is
commonly

in

of

as
a
proposed
criterion
for
machine
consciousness
;
it
has
provoked
a
great
deal
of
philosophical
debate

group
of
scholars
have
argued
that
with
technological
growth
once
machines
begin
to
display
any
substantial
signs
of
human-like
behavior
then
the
dichotomy
(of
human
consciousness
compared
to
human-like
consciousness)
becomes
passé
and
issues
of
machine
autonomy
begin
to
prevail
even
as
observed
in
its
nascent
form
within
contemporary
industry
and
technology
.

^([68][69])
Jürgen
Schmidhuber
argues
that
consciousness
is
the
result
of
compression
.

^([193])
As
an
agent
sees
representation
of
itself
recurring
in
the
environment
,
the
compression
of
this
representation
can
be
called
consciousness
.

though
he
does
agree
with
advocates
of
"weak
AI"
that
computer
programs
can
be
formatted
to
"simulate"
conscious
states
.


His
own
view
is
that
consciousness
has
subjective
,
first-person
causal
powers
by
being
essentially
intentional
due
to
the
way
human
brains
function
biologically
;
conscious
persons
can
perform
computations

but
consciousness
is
not
inherently
computational

way
computer
programs
are

---------------

In
2014
,
Victor
Argonov
has
suggested
a
non-Turing
test
for
machine
consciousness
based
on
a
machine
'
s
ability
to
produce
philosophical
judgments
.

^([199])
He
argues
that
a
deterministic
machine
must
be
regarded
as
conscious
if
it
is
able
to
produce
judgments
on
all
problematic
properties
of
consciousness
(such
as
qualia
or
binding)
having
no
innate
(preloaded)
philosophical
knowledge
on
these
issues
,
no
philosophical
discussions
while
learning
,
and
no
informational
models
of
other
creatures
in
its
memory
(such
models
may
implicitly
or
explicitly
contain
knowledge
about
these
creatures
'

consciousness)
.


However
,
this
test
can
be
used
only
to
detect
,
but
not
refute
the
existence
of
consciousness
.


A
positive
result
proves
that
a
machine
is
conscious
but
a
negative
result
proves
nothing
.


For
example
,
absence
of
philosophical
judgments
may
be
caused
by
lack
of
the
machine
'
s
intellect
,
not
by
absence
of
consciousness
.
