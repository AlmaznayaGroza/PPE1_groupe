how can i have a good conscience





labors on this podcast

 my question is one that i have struggled with
for over two decades now

 it s this how can i live with a good
conscience

 the apostle paul often talks about the conscience and how
specifically a good conscience is something he always lived with
apparently even before he became a christian acts 231 2416

 we also
see that a good conscience is a qualification for christian leaders 1
timothy 39

 and having a good conscience is an important goal of the
christian life for all believers 1 timothy 15 19



“when i read the way paul uses the word conscience in these contexts it
seems like he s saying it means to be presently walking in obedience to
everything god has revealed to him

 he does not seem to mean that he s

for forgiveness according to 1 john 18–10 and matthew 612



“all this means that i literally never have a good conscience — i am
always aware of important ways in which i presently need to repent and
become more holy

 so if a good conscience is a basic christian issue
and paul always had one yet i will always know of sin areas in my life
— and if i have to pray daily for forgiveness — how could i or any
christian for that matter ever attain to a good conscience

”

well arnaldo has done his homework

 he laid out texts in that question


i feel the force of the question

 experientially walking in a good
conscience is not easy for me since i share arnaldo s deep awareness of
my ongoing indwelling sin

 that s paul s term in romans 717 20 23


we all have remaining corruption and indwelling sin

 the more keenly you
are aware of that the more you will feel embattled at the level of
needing a good conscience



 “the whole new testament does assume that in this life nobody attains

to the publican who said “god be merciful to me a sinner

” over
against the pharisee who was thanking god that he had such a clear
conscience — and he said that the one who cried out for mercy about his
sin went down to his house justified luke 1810–14

 it was good for
him to own his sinfulness not to say “oh it doesn t exist

 i ve got a
clear conscience

 i don t have any sin to repent of

” we feel the force



now i think 1 john 1 is not only especially illuminating but gives us a
category alongside good conscience that may provide the solution



walking in the light

cleansing and forgiveness



 “a good conscience is virtually the same as walking in the light

”

here s what i would draw from this if i use the category of conscience
to explain this passage a good conscience is virtually the same as
walking in the light

 christians should be able to say “i m walking in
the light” and mean it and mean by that “i m walking in a good
conscience

” which means i don t think we should equate having a bad
conscience with having indwelling sin

 now that may be the most
important thing i say tony

 let me say it again

 i m inferring from
what i ve said from 1 john 1 that having a bad conscience is not the
same as having indwelling sin

 they re not the same



our clear conscience

that s my basic answer to arnaldo s question

 he feels that as long as
he is aware of the reality of indwelling sin as in romans 7 he cannot
have a good conscience

 now if that were true i don t think paul could
ever have a good conscience but he clearly says he does have a good
conscience



“i thank god whom i serve as did my ancestors with a clear conscience”
2 timothy 13

 he expects the elders of the church to do the same
“they must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience” 1
timothy 39

 that s the goal for all christians

 according to 1 timothy
15 “the aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a
good conscience and a sincere faith

” i don t think we should equate a
good conscience with sinless perfection in this life nor equate a bad
conscience with the presence of indwelling sin or remaining corruption


rather a clear or a good conscience is like walking in the light



 if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship


i think both paul and john inherited this concept of ongoing indwelling
sin that nevertheless coexists with a good conscience from the psalms in
the old testament




not the only place in the psalms there are a lot of psalms that
distinguish the righteous and the wicked

 the righteous are really
righteous they re walking in the light they have a good conscience

 in
david s mind there is an integrity and an uprightness that is aware of
indwelling corruption that breaks out at times in sins

 it does

 and

and used language that way

 john used the language of walking in the
light though we are imperfect

 paul used the language of walking in a
good conscience though we are imperfect

 i think for all of them david
paul john the key that enabled them to think this way is that they
all knew god had made a way for all their sins to be passed over —


i do think arnaldo is right to say that justification by faith is not
the same as walking in a good conscience or walking in the light or
having integrity

 those are real character traits not imputed
righteousness

 nevertheless it s the covering of all their sins by the
blood of jesus that enables them to look upon their conscience and
walking and integrity with thankfulness and confidence that it really
will be accepted by god as good though imperfect



no no no

 that is not the time to say that with your kids listening
and your wife listening and the whole church wondering

 what you need
to say at that moment is this “my conscience is clear

 i am a man of
integrity

 i have walked in the light

 i have never touched that woman
or any woman sexually besides my wife

 this accusation is not true

”

i think that is one of the implications of what paul is saying when he
says to the elders and to the rest of us that we should walk in a good
conscience — or as john would say walk in the light
