How
Can
I
Have
a
Good
Conscience
?




[
]
---------------
labors
on
this
podcast
!


My
question
is
one
that
I
have
struggled
with
for
over
two
decades
now
.


It’s
this
:
How
can
I
live
with
a
good
conscience
?


The
apostle
Paul
often
talks
about
the
conscience
,
and
how
specifically
a
‘good
conscience’
is
something
he
always
lived
with
,
apparently
even
before
he
became
a
Christian
(Acts
23
:1
;
24
:16
)
.


We
also
see
that
a
‘good
conscience’
is
a
qualification
for
Christian
leaders
(1
Timothy
3
:9
)
.


And
having
a
‘good
conscience’
is
an
important
goal
of
the
Christian
life
for
all
believers
(1
Timothy
1
:5
,
19
)
.



“When
I
read
the
way
Paul
uses
the
word
conscience
in
these
contexts
,
it
seems
like
he’s
saying
it
means
to
be
‘presently
walking
in
obedience
to
everything
God
has
revealed
to
him
.

’
He
does
not
seem
to
mean
that
he’s
---------------
for
forgiveness
(according
to
1
John
1
:8–10
and
Matthew
6
:12
)
.



“All
this
means
that
I
literally
never
have
a
good
conscience
—
I
am
always
aware
of
important
ways
in
which
I
presently
need
to
repent
and
become
more
holy
.


So
if
a
good
conscience
is
a
basic
Christian
issue
,
and
Paul
always
had
one
,
yet
I
will
always
know
of
sin
areas
in
my
life
—
and
if
I
have
to
pray
daily
for
forgiveness
—
how
could
I
,
or
any
Christian
for
that
matter
,
ever
attain
to
a
good
conscience
?

”

Well
,
Arnaldo
has
done
his
homework
.


He
laid
out
texts
in
that
question
,
---------------

I
feel
the
force
of
the
question
.


Experientially
,
walking
in
a
good
conscience
is
not
easy
for
me
since
I
share
Arnaldo’s
deep
awareness
of
my
ongoing
,
indwelling
sin
.


That’s
Paul’s
term
in
Romans
7
:17
,
20
,
23
.


We
all
have
remaining
corruption
and
indwelling
sin
.


The
more
keenly
you
are
aware
of
that
,
the
more
you
will
feel
embattled
at
the
level
of
needing
a
good
conscience
.




“The
whole
New
Testament
does
assume
that
in
this
life
,
nobody
attains
---------------
to
the
publican
who
said
,
“God
,
be
merciful
to
me
,
a
sinner
!

”
over
against
the
Pharisee
who
was
thanking
God
that
he
had
such
a
clear
conscience
—
and
he
said
that
the
one
who
cried
out
for
mercy
about
his
sin
went
down
to
his
house
justified
(Luke
18
:10–14
)
.


It
was
good
for
him
to
own
his
sinfulness
,
not
to
say
,
“Oh
,
it
doesn’t
exist
.


I’ve
got
a
clear
conscience
.


I
don’t
have
any
sin
to
repent
of
.

”
We
feel
the
force
.



Now
,
I
think
1
John
1
is
not
only
especially
illuminating
but
gives
us
a
category
alongside
good
conscience
that
may
provide
the
solution
.



Walking
in
the
Light
---------------
cleansing
and
forgiveness
.




“A
good
conscience
is
virtually
the
same
as
walking
in
the
light
.

”

Here’s
what
I
would
draw
from
this
if
I
use
the
category
of
conscience
to
explain
this
passage
:
a
good
conscience
is
virtually
the
same
as
walking
in
the
light
.


Christians
should
be
able
to
say
,
“I’m
walking
in
the
light
,”
and
mean
it
,
and
mean
by
that
,
“I’m
walking
in
a
good
conscience
.

”
Which
means
I
don’t
think
we
should
equate
having
a
bad
conscience
with
having
indwelling
sin
.


Now
,
that
may
be
the
most
important
thing
I
say
,
Tony
.


Let
me
say
it
again
.


I’m
inferring
,
from
what
I’ve
said
from
1
John
1
,
that
having
a
bad
conscience
is
not
the
same
as
having
indwelling
sin
.


They’re
not
the
same
.



Our
Clear
Conscience

That’s
my
basic
answer
to
Arnaldo’s
question
.


He
feels
that
as
long
as
he
is
aware
of
the
reality
of
indwelling
sin
,
as
in
Romans
7
,
he
cannot
have
a
good
conscience
.


Now
,
if
that
were
true
,
I
don’t
think
Paul
could
ever
have
a
good
conscience
,
but
he
clearly
says
he
does
have
a
good
conscience
.



“I
thank
God
whom
I
serve
,
as
did
my
ancestors
,
with
a
clear
conscience”

(2
Timothy
1
:3
)
.


He
expects
the
elders
of
the
church
to
do
the
same
:
“They
must
hold
the
mystery
of
the
faith
with
a
clear
conscience”
(1
Timothy
3
:9
)
.


That’s
the
goal
for
all
Christians
.


According
to
1
Timothy
1
:5
,
“The
aim
of
our
charge
is
love
that
issues
from
a
pure
heart
and
a
good
conscience
and
a
sincere
faith
.

”
I
don’t
think
we
should
equate
a
good
conscience
with
sinless
perfection
in
this
life
,
nor
equate
a
bad
conscience
with
the
presence
of
indwelling
sin
or
remaining
corruption
.


Rather
,
a
clear
or
a
good
conscience
is
like
walking
in
the
light
.




If
we
walk
in
the
light
,
as
he
is
in
the
light
,
we
have
fellowship
---------------

I
think
both
Paul
and
John
inherited
this
concept
of
ongoing
,
indwelling
sin
that
nevertheless
coexists
with
a
good
conscience
from
the
Psalms
in
the
Old
Testament
.



---------------
not
the
only
place
in
the
Psalms
;
there
are
a
lot
of
psalms
that
distinguish
the
righteous
and
the
wicked
.


The
righteous
are
really
righteous
:
they’re
walking
in
the
light
;
they
have
a
good
conscience
.


In
David’s
mind
,
there
is
an
integrity
and
an
uprightness
that
is
aware
of
indwelling
corruption
that
breaks
out
at
times
in
sins
.


It
does
.


And
---------------
and
used
language
that
way
.


John
used
the
language
of
walking
in
the
light
though
we
are
imperfect
.


Paul
used
the
language
of
walking
in
a
good
conscience
though
we
are
imperfect
.


I
think
for
all
of
them
(David
,
Paul
,
John
)
,
the
key
that
enabled
them
to
think
this
way
is
that
they
all
knew
God
had
made
a
way
for
all
their
sins
to
be
passed
over
—
---------------

I
do
think
Arnaldo
is
right
to
say
that
justification
by
faith
is
not
the
same
as
walking
in
a
good
conscience
,
or
walking
in
the
light
,
or
having
integrity
.


Those
are
real
character
traits
,
not
imputed
righteousness
.


Nevertheless
,
it’s
the
covering
of
all
their
sins
by
the
blood
of
Jesus
that
enables
them
to
look
upon
their
conscience
and
walking
and
integrity
with
thankfulness
and
confidence
that
it
really
will
be
accepted
by
God
as
good
,
though
imperfect
.


---------------
No
,
no
,
no
.


That
is
not
the
time
to
say
that
with
your
kids
listening
,
and
your
wife
listening
,
and
the
whole
church
wondering
.


What
you
need
to
say
at
that
moment
is
this
:
“My
conscience
is
clear
.


I
am
a
man
of
integrity
.


I
have
walked
in
the
light
.


I
have
never
touched
that
woman
or
any
woman
sexually
besides
my
wife
.


This
accusation
is
not
true
.

”
---------------
I
think
that
is
one
of
the
implications
of
what
Paul
is
saying
when
he
says
to
the
elders
and
to
the
rest
of
us
that
we
should
walk
in
a
good
conscience
—
or
as
John
would
say
,
walk
in
the
light
.
