Consciousness
is
the
individual
awareness
of
your
unique
thoughts
,
memories
,
feelings
,
sensations
,
and
environments
.


Essentially
,
your
consciousness
is
your
awareness
of
yourself
and
the
world
around
you
.



This
awareness
is
subjective
and
unique
to
you
.


If
you
can
describe
something
you
are
experiencing
in
words
,
then
it
is
part
of
your
consciousness
.



Your
conscious
experiences
are
constantly
shifting
and
changing
.


For
example
,
in
one
moment
,
you
may
be
focused
on
reading
this
article
.


Your
consciousness
may
then
shift
to
the
memory
of
a
conversation
you
had
earlier
with
a
co-worker
.


Next
,
you
might
notice
how
uncomfortable
your
chair
is
,
or
maybe
you
are
mentally
planning
dinner
.

States
of
Consciousness


The
various
states
of
consciousness
include
:

-
Dreams
---------------
-
States
induced
by
psychoactive
drugs

The
two
normal
states
of
awareness
are
consciousness
and
unconsciousness
.


Higher
states
of
consciousness
are
often
associated
with
spiritual
or
mystical
experiences
.


It
involves
an
elevated
state
of
awareness
where
people
are
able
to
gain
a
greater
sense
of
themselves
,
---------------
states
.

 

Altered
levels
of
consciousness
also
can
occur
,
which
may
be
caused
by
medical
or
mental
conditions
that
impair
or
change
awareness
.

 
Altered
types
of
consciousness
include
:

-
Coma
---------------

Doctors
and
healthcare
professionals
use
various
assessments
to
measure
and
assess
levels
of
consciousness
.


They
use
scores
on
these
assessments
to
guide
diagnosis
and
treatment
decisions
.



What
Are
the
5
Levels
of
Consciousness
?



Conscious
:
Everything
you
are
aware
of
---------------
awareness
and
sensation

Subconscious
:
Information
that
is
out
of
consciousness
and
not
immediately
available
to
consciousness

What
Is
the
Unconscious
Mind
?




Functions
of
Consciousness


Consciousness
has
several
biological
and
social
purposes
.


For
example
,
it
allows
us
to
process
information
,
choose
our
actions
,
set
priorities
,
learn
and
adapt
to
new
information
,
make
decisions
,
and
more
.



Consciousness
is
an
essential
state
in
philosophy
,
spirituality
,
and
religion
.


All
of
these
require
self-awareness
,
which
is
impossible
without
consciousness
.




Changes
in
Consciousness


Understanding
different
levels
of
consciousness
can
help
healthcare
professionals
spot
signs
that
someone
might
be
experiencing
a
problem
.


Some
of
these
changes
occur
naturally
;
others
are
the
result
of
factors
such
as
drugs
or
brain
damage
.


Changes
to
consciousness
also
can
cause
changes
to
perception
,
thinking
,
understanding
,
and
interpretations
of
the
world
.



Changes
in
consciousness
can
sometimes
be
a
sign
of
medical
conditions
or
they
may
even
be
a
sign
of
an
immediate
medical
emergency
.



For
example
,
sudden
changes
in
consciousness
might
be
a
sign
of
:

-
Aneurysm
---------------
When
to
Seek
Help

If
you
thinking
you
are
experiencing
changes
in
consciousness
,
talk
to
your
doctor
.


Sudden
changes
may
be
a
sign
of
a
medical
emergency
that
requires
immediate
attention
,
such
as
a
stroke
or
hemorrhage
.

 
---------------
treatment
before
problems
get
worse
.




History
of
Consciousness


For
thousands
of
years
,
the
study
of
human
consciousness
was
largely
the
work
of
philosophers
.


The
French
philosopher
Rene
Descartes
introduced
the
concept
of
mind-body
dualism
or
the
idea
that
while
the
mind
and
---------------
observers
would
carefully
inspect
the
contents
of
their
own
minds
.


Obviously
,
this
was
a
very
subjective
process
,
but
it
helped
inspire
further
research
on
the
scientific
study
of
consciousness
.



The
American
psychologist
William
James
compared
consciousness
to
a
stream—unbroken
and
continuous
despite
constant
shifts
and
changes
.


Psychoanalyst
Sigmund
Freud
focused
on
understanding
the
importance
of
---------------
While
the
focus
of
much
of
the
research
in
psychology
shifted
to
purely
observable
behaviors
during
the
first
half
of
the
20th
century
,
research
on
human
consciousness
has
grown
tremendously
since
the
1950s
.




Theories
of
Consciousness


One
of
the
problems
with
the
study
of
consciousness
is
the
lack
of
a
universally
accepted
operational
definition
.


Descartes
proposed
the
idea
of
cogito
ergo
sum
("I
think
,
therefore
I
am")
,
which
suggested
that
the
very
act
of
thinking
demonstrates
the
reality
of
one’s
existence
and
consciousness
.



Today
,
consciousness
is
generally
defined
as
an
awareness
of
yourself
and
the
world
.


However
,
there
are
still
debates
about
the
different
aspects
of
this
awareness
.



Research
on
consciousness
has
focused
on
understanding
the
neuroscience
behind
our
conscious
experiences
.


Scientists
have
even
utilized
brain-scanning
technology
to
seek
out
specific
neurons
that
might
be
linked
to
different
conscious
events
.


Modern
researchers
have
proposed
two
major
theories
of
consciousness
:
integrated
information
theory
and
global
workspace
theory
.




Integrated
Information
Theory


This
approach
looks
at
consciousness
by
learning
more
about
the
physical
processes
that
underlie
our
conscious
experiences
.


The
theory
attempts
to
create
a
measure
of
the
integrated
information
that
forms
consciousness
.


The
quality
of
an
organism’s
consciousness
is
represented
by
the
level
of
integration
.



---------------
integrated
information
theory
focuses
more
on
identifying
whether
an
organism
is
conscious
,
the
global
workspace
theory
offers
a
much
broader
approach
to
understanding
how
consciousness
works
.

Different

of
Consciousness


Summary


While
consciousness
has
intrigued
philosophers
and
scientists
for
thousands
of
years
,
experts
clearly
have
a
long
way
to
go
in
our
understanding
of
the
concept
.


Researchers
continue
to
explore
the
different
bases
of
consciousness
including
the
physical
,
social
,
cultural
,
and
psychological
influences
that
contribute
to
our
conscious
awareness
.
