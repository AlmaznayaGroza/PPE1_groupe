This
inward
looking
and
subjective
character
of
conscience
is
also
reflected
in
the
etymological
relation
between
the
notion
of
“conscience”
and
that
of
consciousness
.


Only
after
the
17^(th)
Century
did
“consciousness”
start
to
be
used
with
a
distinct
meaning
referring
to
the
psychological
and
phenomenal
dimension
of
the
mind
,
rather
than
to
its
moral
dimension
(for
an
account
of
the
terminological
---------------
and


consciousness
of
an
internal
court
in
man
.


(Kant
1797
[1991
:
189])

This
understanding
of
conscience
as
an
inner

Conscience
so
understood
“establishes
a
general
sense
of
moral
obligation
in
the
individual’s
consciousness”
(Fuss
1964
:

The
subjective
character
of
conscience
implies
that
the
motivational
force
must
come
entirely
from
within
the
individual
,
as

approaching
and
relating
to
such
moral
beliefs

a
“commitment
to

deepest
and
self-identifying
moral
beliefs”
(Sulmasy

and
“a
mode
of
consciousness
in
which
prospective
actions
are
viewed
in
relation
to
one’s
self
and
character”
