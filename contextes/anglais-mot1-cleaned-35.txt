Conscience

I
.


Definition

Conscience
is
a
faculty
of
the
mind
that
motivates
us
to
act
morally—or
at
least
according
to
our
most
deeply
held
values
.

 
Most
say
it
is
a
form
of
intuition
and
uses
emotion
,
although
others
have
argued
that
it
should
be
shaped
by
reason
.

 
It
is
a
private
experience
,
and
a
form
of
self-knowledge
;
from
one’s
conscience
one
can
learn
one’s
own
values
and
morals
.

 
This
is
the
root
of
the
word
,
from
the
latin
con-scientia
,
perhaps
translatable
as
“together-with-knowing”
–
to
be
together
with
one’s
knowledge
(of
morality)
.



Yet
,
conscience
has
been
thought
by
many
to
be
informed
by
an
objective
morality
,
with
divine
,
transcendental
,
or
natural
sources
.

 
Even
in
our
society
,
where
we
ostensibly
recognize
the
cultural
and
personal
relativity
of
morality
,
conscience
is
granted
a
special
status
,
with
laws
protecting
the
rights
of
doctors
and
others
not
to
violate
their
consciences
.

 
So
,
conscience
is
private
,
subjective
,
and
culturally
relative
,
but
carries
legal
and
political
weight
.



There
are
many
different
ideas
about
conscience—religious
,
philosophical
,
scientific
,
legal
,
and
popular
:

-
Religious
:
in
most
religions
,
the
morality
that
informs
conscience

does
or
should
come
from
either
God
,
or
an
enlightened
mind
.



Religions
differ
as
to
whether
conscience
is
thought
of
mainly
as
a

punisher
(e
.

g
.


Catholic)
or
as
a
virtue
to
be
cultivated
(e
.

g
.



Protestant
,
Buddhist)
.


-
Philosophical
:
many
philosophers
have
written
that
a
truly
moral

conscience
requires
the
exercise
of
reason
;
others
have
claimed
that

it
is
an
intuition
of
objective
moral
truth
.


Pre-modern
philosophers

tended
to
believe
in
a
natural
and
objective
morality
informing

conscience—something
like
a
truly
moral
instinct
.

 
Modern

philosophers
tend
to
recognize
the
cultural
and
individual

relativity
of
morality
,
and
many
present
arguments
based
on
---------------
-
Scientific
:
such
as
theories
in
evolutionary
psychology
,
cognitive

science
,
and
sociology
.


-
Legal
:
Our
society
seems
to
recognize
“freedom
of
conscience”
–
that

we
should
be
free
to
obey
our
consciences
–
within
limits
.



Considering
that
we
don’t
have
a
clear
or
unified
philosophy
of

conscience
,
this
raises
legal
,
political
,
and
social
issues
.


-
Popular
:
Our
everyday
notions
of
conscience
are
philosophically

interesting
.


Consider
that
conscience
is
a
part
of
us
opposing

actions
that
we
ourselves
apparently
already
consider
immoral
,
but

are
in
danger
of
doing
anyway
.

 
It
seems
a
little
paradoxical
.

 
Why

do
we
need
a
conscience
?


Evolutionary
theory
most
likely
has
the

answer
(see
“History”
section)

Thought
about
conscience
is
so
diverse
and
complex
that
a
comprehensive
treatment
is
not
possible
.


This
seems
another
paradox
about
conscience
;
we
know
it
most
intimately
in
ourselves
,
but
there
is
no
consensus
about
where
it
comes
from
,
or
how
much
it
should
be
respected
.

Controversies
about
Conscience

Freedom
of
conscience
is
part
of
the
United
Nations’
Declaration
of
Human
Rights
,
and
the
laws
of
many
nations
.

 
Yet
we
have
reason
to
question
the
idea
.

 
Former
Nazi
generals
have
told
interviewers
that
they
acted
with
a
clear
conscience
,
because
their
actions
were
sanctioned
by
their
leadership
and
society
.

 
This
would
be
consistent
with
ideas
about
conscience
as
a
social
instinct
,
but
not
necessarily
an
altruistic
one
as
Darwin
thought—perhaps
conscience
merely
urges
us
to
conform
with
the
mores
of
our
society
or
belief-systems
.



Freedom
of
conscience
is
problematic
because
it’s
perfectly
possible
for
people’s
consciences
to
insist
on
actions
that
most
of
consider
harmful
to
other
human
beings—such
as
refusing
to
vaccinate
their
children
.



There
are
several
traditional
arguments
in
favor
of
freedom
of
conscience
:

-
The
argument
from
hypocrisy
or
ineffectiveness
:
Most
people
agree

that
it
is
impossible
to
change
a
person’s
conscience
from
the

outside
;
therefore
,
not
granting
freedom
of
conscience
means

requiring
people
to
act
contrary
to
their
beliefs
,
which
seems

wrong
.


This
was
a
reason
to
consider
persecuting
heretics
---------------

However
,
the
argument
from
hypocrisy
can
be
turned
around
;
if
you
can’t
change
a
person’s
conscience
,
then
they
still
have
freedom
of
conscience
,
even
if
you
force
them
to
behave
in
a
certain
way
.



-
The
argument
from
ignorance
:
This
is
based
on
the
recognition
of

relativism
and
subjectivism
.


If
our
consciences
don’t
give
us

objective
moral
guidance
,
then
you
can’t
assume
that
yours
is
right

and
another’s
wrong
,
therefore
you
don’t
have
a
right
to
deny
them

freedom
of
conscience
.


-
The
argument
from
legitimization
:
John
Stuart
Mill
argued
that
it
is

best
for
society
if
all
people
express
their
convictions
freely
,
for
---------------

However
,
none
of
these
arguments
completely
addresses
the
conflicts
between
freedom
of
conscience
and
public
well-being
.

 
Some
might
say
that
a
doctor
who
refuses
to
perform
a
life-saving
operation
out
of
conscience
should
be
charged
with
negligence
or
even
manslaughter
.

 
While
others
might
feel
that
performing
the
operation
is
murder
.


The
precise
limits
of
freedom
of
conscience
are
still
an
open
debate
with
profound
consequences
.

“There
comes
a
time
when
one
must
take
a
position
that
is
neither

safe
,
nor
politic
,
nor
popular
,
but
he
must
take
it
because

tells
him
it

,
A
Testament
of
Hope
:
The
Essential
Writings
---------------

This
quote
seems
to
represent
the
way
most
of
us
naturally
think
of
conscience—assuming
that
conscience
is
always
right
,
as
if
it’s
a
direct
line
to
God
or
some
other
source
of
objective
moral
knowledge
.

 
This
also
implies
that
it
is
right
to
obey
conscience
even
if
opposes
one’s
social
and
legal
environment
.

 
One
the
one
hand
,
these
could
be
incorrect
and
dangerous
assumptions
;
on
the
other
,
we
could
never
change
injustice
in
our
society

like

without
sometimes
trusting
conscience
over
social

Types
of
Conscience

There
are
no
‘types
of
conscience’
recognized
by
philosophers
except
‘critical
conscience’
which
means
the
application
of
critical
reasoning
to
ethical
decisions
.

 
Many
religious
web-pages
list
their
own
types
of
conscience
,
in
light
of
their
beliefs
.



Conscience
versus
Sociopathy

Sociopaths
are
,
arguably
,
individuals
with
no
conscience
.

 
They
are
also
defined
as
incapable
of
feeling
empathy
,
guilt
,
fear
,
or
shame
at
hurting
others
or
violating
any
notion
of
morality
.

 
Interestingly

concrete
differences
between
normal

Ironically
,
then
sociopaths
seem
to
be
evidence
that
a
capacity
for
conscience
is
innate
in
normal
humans

History
of
Conscience

Before
cultural
relativity
and
subjectivism
came
into
vogue
during
the
20^(th)
century
,
conscience
was
considered
a
source
of
objective
moral
knowledge
by
almost
everyone
,
however
in
different
senses
in
different
cultures
.

 
In
ancient
Hinduism
,
Buddhism
,
and
Taoism
,
knowledge
of
good
---------------
more
likely
a
source
of
sin
than
morality
.

 
Instead
,
obedience
to
God’s
law
is
thought
the
only
true
morality
.

 
This
would
mean
that
true
conscience
is
knowledge
of
God’s
law
,
whether
that
comes
directly
from
God
,
or
through
obedience
to
scripture
or
clergy
;
all
these
possibilities—direct
revelation
,
scripture
,
and
obedience
to
authorities–have
been
claimed
as
the
source
of
moral
knowledge
in
these
religions
.

 
However
,
in
practice
,
these
religions
also
teach
purification
of
the
mind
to
attain
true
conscience
;
where
Eastern
religions
teach
that
a
pure
mind
allows
the
truth
to
emerge
from
within
one’s
own
consciousness
,
most
versions
of
the
Abrahamic
religions
see
a
---------------

Despite
the
emphasis
on
blind
obedience
in
Christianity
,
medieval
Christian
philosophers
developed
a
theory
of
conscience
with
a
strong
role
for
both
intuition
and
reasoning
.

 
St
.


Bonaventure
and
St
.


Aquinas
wrote
of
synderesis
–
a
divine
spark
of
moral
knowledge
–
which
could
---------------
perspective
of
eternity
,
with
a
peaceful
mind
,
you
will
perceive
moral
truth
.

  
Kant
also
regarded
critical
reasoning
as
an
important
element
of
conscience
,
believing
that
moral
truth
could
be
evaluated
objectively
in
light
of
his
‘categorical
imperative
.

’ 
Other
18^(th)
century
philosophers
believed
that
conscience
was
purely
intuitive
,
excluding
reason
,
but
like
Kant
,
many
of
them
also
believed
in
the
objectivity
of
the
moral
truth
informing
conscience
.



From
the
18^(th)
century
on
,
increasing
numbers
of
philosophers
spoke
for
pragmatic
and
relativistic
ideas
about
conscience
.

 
John
Locke
wrote
about
how
a
moral
conscience
might
oppose
the
laws
of
the
state
,
and
Thomas
Hobbes
insisted
that
opinions
based
on
conscience
could
easily
be
wrong
or
in
contradiction
to
other
people’s
consciences
.

 
So
,
these
and
other
philosophers
also
advocated
for
a
‘critical
conscience’–and
some
skepticism
about
the
dictates
of
conscience
in
general
.



In
the
19^(th)
century
,
Darwin
hypothesized
that
conscience
evolved
to
resolve
conflicts
between
instincts
,
such
as
between
instincts
for
self-preservation
and
instincts
to
protect
and
cooperate
with
other
human
beings
.



In
the
20^(th)
century
,
Freud
analyzed
conscience
as
an
effect
of
the
super-ego
;
as
we
grow
up
,
natural
instincts
such
as
aggression
and
sexual
desire
must
be
frequently
frustrated
,
and
even
punished
,
by
---------------
them
.



Where
Darwin
said
that
conscience
evolved
to
resolve
inner
conflicts
,
other
more
recent
evolutionary
psychologists
suggest
that
it
evolved
to
motivate
altruistic
behavior
,
which
is
now
thought
to
be
evolutionarily
adaptive
for
social
creatures
.



Few
today
would
claim
that
conscience
is
a
source
of
objective
morality
,
divine
,
transcendental
or
otherwise
,
since
it
is
obvious
that
two
people’s
consciences
or
religions
can
dictate
opposing
moralities—such
as
pro-choice
and
pro-life
.

  
Therefore
,
philosophers
today
are
more
concerned
with
exploring
the
consequences
of
this
relativity
of
conscience
,
especially
since
people
still
seem
to
think
of
conscience
as
objectively
true
,
sacred
,
and
inviolable
.


Which
leads
naturally
to
our
controversy
–
“freedom
of
conscience
.

Conscience
in
Pop
Culture

Example
#1
:
Pinocchio
---------------

In
this
clip
from
the
old
Disney
Pinocchio
film
,
Jiminy
Cricket
gives
the
boy
who
would
be
human
a
lecture
and
song
about
conscience
with
the
message
“always
let
your
conscience
be
your
guide
.

” 
Although
that
message
implies
relying
on
intuitive
conscience
,
it’s
interesting
that
the
Cricket
first
tries
to
explain
something
like
‘critical
conscience’
to
Pinocchio
before
giving
up
in
confusion
and
falling
back
on
a
traditional
Christian
notion
of
conscience—resistance
to
temptation
.
