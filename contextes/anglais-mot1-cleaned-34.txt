secondary precept that euthanasia is wrong



aquinas view of the conscience

natural law is aquinas theory on how god is the grounding and source of
morality

 conscience is about the human psychology involved in
understanding and applying natural moral law

 conscience is ratio
reason used to understand and apply god s natural law



aquinas claims that the classic features of conscience follow from the
application of our knowledge of the natural moral law to our moral
actions in three ways

1

 witness – by knowing whether we have done or not done something


2

 bind incite – “through the conscience we judge that something
 should be done or not done”
3

 accuse torment rebuke – “by conscience we judge that something
 done is well done or ill done”

this is how the conscience causes guilt

 conscience is our ability to
know whether we have done something whether we should have done it and
whether it was done well

 if we have done something wrong our
conscience will accuse torment and rebuke us – causing feelings of
guilt



because human reason is fallible the conscience thereby becomes
fallible

 we could be mistaken for example when we don t know how a
general rule applies to a certain situation mistake in conscientia



called apparent goods because they only appear good to someone engaged
in faulty reasoning

 they are not real goods

 despite this potential for
our conscience judging something bad to be good aquinas still insists
we must follow it

“every judgment of conscience be it right or wrong is obligatory he
who acts against his conscience always sins”

this is because if you choose to act against your conscience then you
are choosing to do something you believe to be evil

 conscience is thus
always binding 



vincible vs invincible ignorance

whether errors in conscience that lead to sinful acts will be forgiven
or pardoned depends on the type of ignorance that caused the error




very statement that man is estranged from his created nature presupposes
an experience of the abyss between what he essentially is and what is
existentially is

 even a weak or misled conscience is still a
conscience namely the silent voice of man s own essential nature
judging his actual being” – tillich



to deny that our conscience can discover the natural law is to claim
that there is a gap between what we currently are and what we could be


yet to have an awareness of that gap is to have a conscience that is
aware of its fallen state

 so it is contradictory to deny the natural
law

 even it now involves a weakened conscience that still tells us at
least something of the direction we have fallen in and the direction
back towards righteousness



however whatever a weak and misled conscience discovers is surely not
god s morality

 humanity believing it has the ability to know anything
of god is the same arrogance that caused adam and eve to disobey god



inability to be humble enough to simply have faith



psychological views on the conscience

sigmund freud

freud thought the conscience was just the result of psychological forces
that science could understand

 freud believed the mind was divided into
the id our unconscious animalistic desires ego our conscious

thought responsible for many mental problems



the ethical implications is that conscience is not the voice of god in
us it is just what our society wants from us

 our society might be good
or bad therefore our conscience is not the best guide if freud is
right

 furthermore there might not even be a good or bad if morality
is merely the conditioning of societies on its members



mature genital stage lasts until death

 controlled sexual desires
result in a desire for love and marriage

 a person now has a fully
developed conscience where the ego controls the id with reference to the
superego




thus be seen to defend freud to some degree from the accusation of being
unscientific

 he studied the development of children and argued that
there occurs a fundamental shift in the nature of conscience 

 before
the age of 11 children have what he called heteronomous morality

 this
means they merely associate actions as bad because of the influence of

abstract cognitive moral beliefs about how one ought to act and why



freud s critique of religion s approach to developing the conscience

maintaining social order depends on people repressing their antisocial

after millennia of religious rule too many people are still unhappy
being controlled by social rules

 freud claims this is because the
religious approach to conscience is external imposition by authority
similar to how children are treated the result being comparable to a
 childhood neurosis 

 although rules are in place to reduce suffering


perhaps freud s critique only really works against approaches to the
conscience like augustine s where it simply involves an external
imposition of god s law



possible exam questions for conscience

easy
critically compare aquinas and freud s view of the conscience
are the workings of god present in the conscience



medium
 freud makes more sense of the concept of guilt than aquinas – discuss


does a theological approach to conscience work better than a
psychological approach


critically compare aquinas and freud s views on the process of moral


hard
does conscience exist at all or is it an umbrella term for culture
environment genetics and education


is conscience merely an umbrella term for the psychological factors
involved in moral decision making


critically assess freud s psychosexual approach
