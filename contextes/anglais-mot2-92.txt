   FALSE consciousness is a term used to describe the way in which
   exploited, oppressed or disadvantaged groups in society accept,
   assimilate and indeed actively defend or promote ideas which ultimately
--
   (see Q&A 51).

   “False consciousness” often manifests itself as so-called “common
   sense”. Examples include the notion that capitalism, “private
   enterprise”, profit, “the market” is simply how things are. That those
--
   can’t be changed.

   False consciousness is related to the ever changing economic and social
   base of capitalism. Marx and Engels declared:
   “The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas,
--
   ideas of its dominance.”

   Marx and Engels argued that false consciousness applies particularly in
   regard to abstract ideas, such as property rights, “ie ideas which
   increasingly take on the form of universality. For each new class which
--
   represent them as the only rational, universally valid ones”.

   The term “false consciousness” was first used by Engels who emphasised
   that it was not simply a passive absorption of ruling-class ideas and
   values, but involves an active acquiescence in adopting and developing
   those ideas: “a process accomplished by the so-called thinker
   consciously, indeed, but with a false consciousness”.  False
   consciousness was an aspect of ideology but, Engels declared, had been
   neglected by Marxists because of “the fatuous notion of the ideologists
   that because we deny an independent historical development to the

   Gramsci in the 1930s further developed the notion of false
   consciousness as part of the political superstructure, as a vehicle for
   delivering capitalist hegemony – the dominant but changing set of
   cultural and ideological norms which determine the boundaries of what
--
   adapt and survive.

   False consciousness is in part a consequence of the hegemony of
   propaganda, of the institutions of the capitalist state including
   education and the media, which encourages, and for some individuals

   therefore be changed.

   False consciousness reveals itself above all in conformity – how the
   need to keep a job to pay the rent or mortgage, feed the kids, heat the
   home, enjoy the occasional luxury becomes seen as normal, the natural
--
   simply enjoying the rights of ownership.

   Ultimately, false consciousness legitimates the power of the ruling
   class.

   Engels for example declared that art is far richer and more
   “opaque” than political and economic theory because it is less
   explicit, less purely ideological. So challenging false consciousness
   is not (just) a matter of political education and social argument. As
   the excellent culture pages in this paper show, the battle is also

   us insights into the realities”.

   False consciousness is the antithesis of class consciousness, of the
   development of a “class for itself”. Class consciousness involves
   forging a counter-culture which sees beyond the limitations of
   capitalism.

   But socialism survived – and survives – not least in Cuba, in perhaps
   the least propitious of circumstances, due to the consciousness and
   engagement of workers and communities in protecting the gains of their
   revolution. And socialist ideas continue to inspire struggles for

   Central to Marx’s concept of historical materialism is the
   understanding that it is not consciousness that determines people’s
   existence, but their social existence that determines their
   consciousness.

   However the form that consciousness takes can vary. As Gawain Little
   pointed out in an article in this paper, the hegemony exercised by
   capital is in a constant process of being remade and reconfigured.
