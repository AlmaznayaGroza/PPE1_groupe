strategy
.


Every
company
has
a
purpose
,
explicit
or
not
;
however
,
few
–
although
this
is
changing
–
have
a
conscience
.


To
be
clear
,
the
Mafia
has
a
purpose
,
but
consciousness
is
just
another
story
.



Let’s
start
with
this
Litmus
test
:
“Who
said
this
statement
?

”
---------------
it
.



Consciousness
needs
sincerity
rather
than
authenticity

For
a
company
,
being
true
to
itself
means
being
concerned
,
admitting
---------------
In
addition
,
when
the
purpose
includes
the
impact
on
society
and
the
environment
,
the
brand
as
a
business
platform
helps
prove
the
consciousness
of
the
company
,
not
to
mention
internal
issues
of
governance
and
responsible
investments
.
