The
Evil
Conscience


“Let
us
draw
near
with
a
sincere
heart
in
full
assurance
of
faith
,

having
our
hearts
sprinkled
clean
from
an
evil
conscience
and
our

bodies
washed
with
pure
water
.

”


Hebrews
10
:22

How
could
this
be
?


A
conscience
that
is
evil
?


The
traditionalists
are
going
to
faint
when
they
hear
about
this
!


Could
it
be
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
conscience
that
directs
man
to
do
what
is
evil
instead
of
what
is
good
?


Absolutely
.


Just
as
it
is
possible
to
have
a
broken
compass
that
points
east
instead
of
north
.


---------------
continually
(Genesis
6
:5
)
.


These
men
were
later
annihilated
by
the
flood
.


Think
about
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
:
do
you
think
those
guys
were
interested
in
doing
what
was
right
based
on
their
conscience
?


They
were
only
interested
in
sex
with
any
man
or
woman
they
could
find
.


Don’t
be
surprised
,
this
is
what
the
heart
,
mind
and
conscience
of
man
can
degenerate
into
.

 

The
conscience
of
man
can
be
such
that
instead
of
leading
you
to
do
what
is
right
,
it
leads
you
to
do
what
is
evil
.


Again
,
like
the
Seared
Conscience
,
you
can
either
develop
an
evil
conscience
or
be
born
with
it
.


The
difference
between
the
seared
and
evil
conscience
is
that
a
seared
conscience
is
devoid
of
guilt
or
without
regret
from
doing
what
is
wrong
,
or
the
conscience
itself
is
silent
;
an
evil
conscience
,
however
,
directs
the
heart
of
man
towards
evil
instead
of
good
,
doing
the
opposite
of
what
a
normal
,
functioning
conscience
would
do
.

 

In
theory
:
A
good
conscience
keeps
us
from
doing
wrong
because
it
is
a
voice
within
that
directs
us
towards
the
right
action
.



An
evil
conscience
desires
for
us
to
do
what
is
wrong
constantly
,
and
because
of
this
desire
,
there
is
no
guilt
associated
with
committing
whatever
evil
deed
your
heart
desires
.

 

You
would
be
surprised
to
hear
that
such
a
conscience
is
actually
quite
prevalent
in
the
Church
.


Because
it
is
easy
to
do
evil
and
still
walk
into
the
assembly
like
there
is
nothing
wrong
.


This
is
popular
at
highly
---------------
assembly
.

 

An
evil
conscience
will
keep
you
sinning
and
give
you
no
reason
to
change
.


All
the
popular 
tools
of
change
endorsed
by
the
Church

(Guilt/Shame/Conscience/Fear
)
have
been
taken
out
of
your
toolbelt
.


According
to
them
,
you
will
not
be
able
to
progress
.


Without
an
overwhelming
sense
of
guilt
,
how
will
you
change
?

 
---------------
all
emotion
,
men
must
press
on
and
do
what
is
right
.


They
must
work
,
improve
,
train
and
move
towards
being
the
fully
formed
and
functional
men
they
need
to
be
.


Reject
the
weak
man’s
idea
of
conscience
,
embrace
the
rigid
strength
of
discipline
unaltered
by
feeling
.



Mantra

Reject
conscience
,
embrace
action
.

Application

If
you
have
an
evil
conscience
,
you
must
do
the
opposite
of
what
your
conscience
tells
you
to
do
.


It
is
as
simple
as
that
.


If
your
conscience
is
evil
,
it
is
pulling
you
towards
evil
action
,
so
you
must
resist
your
conscience
and
oppose
it
in
order
to
do
what
is
right
.


Again
,
it
does
not
matter
if
you
feel
like
doing
what
is
right
,
or
if
you
want
to
,
or
what
your
motivation
is
,
it
only
matters
if
you
do
what
is
right
or
not
.


What
are
your
actions
?


They
can
be
good
or
evil
regardless
of
what
kind
of
conscience
you
have
.

 

Again
,
and
at
risk
of
being
overly
redundant
,
reject
the
idea
of
the
necessity
of
conscience
.

 

Conscience
is
a
tool
to
be
used
for
change
,
but
change
is
possible
without
this
tool
.


This
is
a
principle
fact
of
life
.


You
must
do
what
is
right
regardless
of
emotional
states
,
including
the
emotional
state
of
a
conscience
.


You
must
focus
and
take
action
.


Do
what
is
right
.


Be
a
Man
.



Conduct
Yourselves
Like
Men
.
