   An altered level of consciousness is any measure of arousal other than
   normal. Level of consciousness (LOC) is a measurement of a person's
   arousability and responsiveness to stimuli from the environment.^[1] A
   mildly depressed level of consciousness or alertness may be classed as
   lethargy; someone in this state can be aroused with little
   difficulty.^[1] People who are obtunded have a more depressed level of
   consciousness and cannot be fully aroused.^[1]^[2] Those who are not
   able to be aroused from a sleep-like state are said to be
   stuporous.^[1]^[2] Coma is the inability to make any purposeful
   response.^[1]^[2] Scales such as the Glasgow coma scale have been
   designed to measure the level of consciousness.

   An altered level of consciousness can result from a variety of factors,
   including alterations in the chemical environment of the brain (e.g.
   exposure to poisons or intoxicants), insufficient oxygen or blood flow
   in the brain, and excessive pressure within the skull. Prolonged
   unconsciousness is understood to be a sign of a medical emergency.^[3]
   A deficit in the level of consciousness suggests that both of the
   cerebral hemispheres or the reticular activating system have been
   injured.^[4] A decreased level of consciousness correlates to increased
   morbidity (sickness) and mortality (death).^[5] Thus it is a valuable
   measure of a patient's medical and neurological status. In fact, some
   sources consider level of consciousness to be one of the vital
   signs.^[3]^[6]

   Scales and terms to classify the levels of consciousness differ, but in
   general, reduction in response to stimuli indicates an altered level of
   consciousness:

   Level Summary (Kruse)^[2] Description
   Metaconscious Preternatural People who possess the ability to monitor
   and control their own cognitive processes in addition to meeting all
   the criteria indicative of a normal level of consciousness. In the
   field of cognitive neuroscience, metacognitive monitoring and control
   have been viewed as functions of the prefrontal cortex, which receives
--
   and time, or "oriented X3".^[8] A normal sleep stage from which a
   person is easily awakened is also considered a normal level of
   consciousness.^[9] "Clouding of consciousness" is a term for a mild
   alteration of consciousness with alterations in attention and
   wakefulness.^[9]
   Confused Disoriented; impaired thinking and responses People who do not

   slowed responses, and sleepiness.^[9]
   Stuporous Sleep-like state (not unconscious); little/no spontaneous
   activity People with an even lower level of consciousness, stupor, only
   respond by grimacing or drawing away from painful stimuli.^[8]
   Comatose Cannot be aroused; no response to stimuli Comatose people do

   and they may have no pupillary response to light.^[8]

   Altered level of consciousness is sometimes described as altered
   sensorium.

   Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). It has come into almost universal use for
   assessing people with brain injury,^[2] or an altered level of
   consciousness. Verbal, motor, and eye-opening responses to stimuli are
   measured, scored, and added into a final score on a scale of 3â€“15, with
   a lower score being a more decreased level of consciousness.^[citation

   reticular formation.^[9] Since this system is thought to modulate
   wakefulness and sleep, interference with it, such as injury, illness,
   or metabolic disturbances, could alter the level of consciousness.^[9]

   Normally, stupor and coma are produced by interference with the brain
--
   coma due to their effects on the reticular formation.^[11] Mass lesions
   that occur above the tentorium cerebelli normally do not significantly
   alter the level of consciousness unless they are very large or affect
   both cerebral hemispheres.^[9]

--
   reactions to stimuli such as touch and pain are noted.^[12] Reflexes,
   such as the cough and gag reflexes, are also means of judging LOC.^[12]
   Once the level of consciousness is determined, clinicians seek clues
   for the cause of any alteration.^[9] Usually the first tests in the ER
   are pulse oximetry to determine if there is hypoxia, serum glucose

   A lowered level of consciousness indicate a deficit in brain
   function.^[4] Level of consciousness can be lowered when the brain
   receives insufficient oxygen (as occurs in hypoxia); insufficient blood
   (as occurs in shock, in children for example due to intussusception);
   or has an alteration in the brain's chemistry.^[3] Conditions of the
   heart and conditions of the lungs can alter consciousness. Metabolic
   disorders such as diabetes mellitus and uremia can alter
   consciousness.^[12] Hypo- or hypernatremia (decreased and elevated
   levels of sodium, respectively) as well as dehydration can also produce
   an altered LOC.^[13] A pH outside of the range the brain can tolerate

   result from traumatic brain injury such as concussion.^[12] Ischemic
   stroke and brain bleeding are other causes of altered
   consciousness.^[12] Infections of the central nervous system may also
   be associated with decreased LOC; for example, an altered LOC is the
   most common symptom of encephalitis.^[14] Neoplasms within the
   intracranial cavity can also affect consciousness,^[12] as can epilepsy
   and post-seizure states.^[9] A decreased LOC can also result from a
   combination of factors.^[12] A concussion, which is a mild traumatic

   Treatment depends on the degree of decrease in consciousness and its
   underlying cause. Initial treatment often involves the administration
   of dextrose if the blood sugar is low as well as the administration of
