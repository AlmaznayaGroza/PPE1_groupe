The universal mind, or universal consciousness, is a metaphysical
concept suggesting an underlying essence of all beings and becoming in
the universe. It includes the being and becoming that occurred in the
universe prior to the emergence of the concept of mind, a term that more
appropriately refers to the organic, human aspect of universal
consciousness. It addresses inorganic being and becoming and the
interactions that occur in that process without specific reference to
the physical and chemical laws that try to describe those interactions.
Those interactions have occurred, do occur, and continue to occur.
Universal consciousness is the source that underlies those interactions
and the awareness and knowledge they imply.
