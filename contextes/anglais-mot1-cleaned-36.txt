 introduction

each of us has at one time or another talked about our conscience

 we
might have been “pricked by our conscience” or our conscience might have
“butted in” when it was not wanted

 we might be going on quite happily
telling a lie to a friend or might have accidentally walked out of a
shop without paying for something and it is our conscience that makes us
confess or stops us in our tracks spins us on our heels and takes us
back into the shop



people from different walks of life talk of the “conscience” from the
religious believer the politician the celebrity to every day folk we
might hear someone berate their conscience for nagging them to do
something they do not want to

 people might be labelled “conscientious
objectors” because they feel their conscience is telling them to object
to certain political actions e

g

 war

 a protester might lament the
erosion of their “freedom of conscience”

 and we can find concepts very
similar to “conscience” in many nonchristian religious traditions both
eastern and western throughout history and from around the globe

1

however the nature of conscience is obscure and consequently the
philosophical discussion of conscience is complex and has a long
history

 it draws on issues in philosophical psychology philosophy of
religion epistemology philosophy of mind applied ethics normative


in this chapter we ll give a general overview of two theories of
conscience

 one draws on aquinas s account the other sigmund freud s
1856–1939

 although freud is not typically seen as a philosopher he s
a psychologist his account will provide us with some insights which
allows us to think philosophically about this thing we call “the
conscience”



2

 the history of conscience

in the twentyfirst century conscience is not thought of as solely a
religious idea

 however talk of “conscience” was popularised at least
in “the west” due to its adoption by both protestant and catholic
traditions

 in this section we ll look how “conscience” is and has
been used in order to draw out some general features



“conscience” played a role in one of the most famous speeches in the
protestant reformation

 martin luther 1483–1546 being charged with
heresy and being forced to recant by charles v stands his grounds and
says “here i stand i can do no other” and “i cannot nor will i retract
anything since it is never safe nor virtuous to go against conscience”


luther believed that his godgiven conscience was not allowing him to
recant not even under the considerable pressure by the powerful people
before him

 or consider a more recent example



his views said

but conscience asks the question is it right

 and there comes a time
when we must take a position that is neither safe nor politic nor
popular but one must take it because it is right

2

conscience is then powerful

 it seems that it can move a person to put
themselves in mortal danger to “stand up and be counted” to act
contrary to selfinterest



but it is not just saints and heroes that talk of conscience conscience
has been cited by the most repugnant and morally abhorrent people who
have ever lived racists murderers tyrants dictators

 for example as
bettina stangneth s states in eichmann before jerusalem the unexamined
life of a mass murderer3 a discussion of the inner life of one of the
nazi s most notorious officers “conscience was simply the morality of
the fatherland that dwells within a person which eichmann also termed
 the voice of the blood ”



conscience can be male or female or both or neither it can be one voice
or many it can echo religious ideas social ideas racist ideas lofty
ideas or ideas found in the filth of human corruption

 conscience can
develop at any particular age and dissipates at any age

 it does not
“speak” and it does “speak” and does not have a language of choice




there seem to be at least three related functions that we think the
conscience plays

 first it tells us what we ought to do as a guide for
our lives

 second it is a source of moral knowledge

 that is we might
say “i know that stealing a pen is wrong because my conscience told me”


third it might be thought of as a motivation

 that is it might be the
thing that actually gets us up out of our seat to act in certain ways


just to clarify we can see the difference in the first two of these
functions if we think of a tyrant who says for example “my conscience
tells me i have to kill all mentally ill people to help the country”


clearly this is a case where her conscience is telling her how she ought
to behave

 but given that we think that killing the mentally ill is
morally wrong we do not want to say that in this case her conscience
gives her knowledge of what is right and wrong

 so it might be true that
the conscience gives us guidance but not knowledge



equally the opposite seems true that we might know what is right and
wrong yet fail to be guided to do it

 this predicament is what
shakespeare captured in this famous quotation “conscience doth make
cowards of us all” hamlet 3

1

78–82



consider another point

 conscience is subjective in that it is about one
reflecting inwards on oneself on how one might “feel” about certain
things

 it is not about looking out into the world at a set of rules or
laws

 we experience the conscience differently than we would if a
friend priest politician or imam was telling us what to do

 of course
although conscience is “inward looking” that is not the same as saying
that we just make up what the conscience allegedly tells us

 for
instance we might think that what is right and wrong is dependent on
god but also think that we come to know what is right and wrong through
our conscience



finally it is worth noting that the term “conscience” was only
formalized in its modern moral meaning in the mid eighteenth century
e

g

 neither plato nor aristotle talk of conscience

 however note
that just because a term is modern or just because there is
disagreement with how a term is used that does not mean that the ideas

scientific community

 this in itself does not lead us to the conclusion
that there are no molecules and no atoms

 so the lack of term
“conscience” and disagreement about what “conscience” means does not
mean that conscience is merely an “invention”

 with all these points in
mind let s consider one of the key thinkers in relation to conscience
aquinas



3

 aquinas on conscience

if you recall from aquinas developed a natural law theology

 the basic


they show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts
their consciences also bearing witness and their thoughts sometimes
accusing them and at other times even defending them

4

notice then that for paul — and aquinas — the “conscience” bears witness
sometimes accusing the person sometimes defending them

 for aquinas
conscience is morally neutral it simply “bears witness” it is a
“signpost” and after all signposts do not opinions on things see
aquinas summa part 1 question 79 article 13



to be clear then aquinas did not take conscience to be a source of moral
knowledge but as a guide

 this means that aquinas unlike luther and
postreformation thinkers took conscience to be fallible

 for aquinas
we may be wrong in following our conscience as it can move us in the
wrong directionmislead us

for aquinas the conscience is the act of applying the universal
principles the eternaldivine law to actual real life situations



aquinas explicitly defines “conscience” as the “application of knowledge
to activity” summa theologica i–ii i

 so if conscience for aquinas
is about the application of knowledge to activity this raises the
question how we get this knowledge

 this is where another key technical
term is introduced

 the synderesis

 synderesis is not the same as
conscience but is the innate ability of the mind — what he calls a habit
of the mind — to apprehend the eternaldivine laws

 the role of
conscience is to apply the primary precepts discovered as the content of
synderesis




reflection they will see that it is the straight line

 this “coming to
recognize through reflection” is what aquinas has in mind when he talks
about synderesis

 for aquinas unlike conscience synderesis is never
mistaken

 humans do wrong thinks aquinas when conscience and not
synderesis makes a mistake

 this means that a failure of conscience
needs to be clearly thought through on aquinas s account



for aquinas conscience errs because of ignorance about how to apply the
eternaldivine laws of which there are two types

 ignorance that can be
overcome by using one s reason vincible ignorance and ignorance that

invincible ignorance is doing something wrong when one could not have
known better vincible ignorance is doing wrong when one ought to have
known better

 but how might this relate to conscience



imagine two people going into a gun shop

 the first person has no

and they have no record of mental illness

 he is for all intents and
purposes a model citizen

 this person buys a gun and goes on a killing
rampage

 the owner of the shop by following her conscience has not
done something morally wrong because her ignorance is invincible there
was no indication that this would have been a likely outcome



this contrasts to the person who is sold a gun even though he has a
violent criminal record which would have shown up on a basic background
check

 in this case the owner of the gun shop following her conscience
has done something morally wrong because in this case her ignorance is
vincible



and wrong through synderesis

 however even though we are infallible
about this we can and do make mistakes in applying this knowledge

 it
is our conscience conscientia which tells us how to apply this
knowledge and moves us to act

 it can go wrong through ignorance


ignorance which could have been avoided vincible means our action is


in the next section we will consider what freud has to say about
conscience and explain how he reconceptualises it as a psychological
and not theological concept and in doing so argues we should not accept
it as an inherently good notion



4

 freud and the conscience

freud is best known as a psychologist and the architect of

talk in the form of a “freudian slip”

 among freud s many ideas his
conceptualization of the structure of the mind is key to his views on
conscience

 he thinks the mind can be thought of as containing three
parts the id the ego and the superego

 freud s account of conscience
is understood as the relation between these




from the superego



where does the conscience come in

 for freud the conscience is the form
that the superego takes in addressing the ego

 when the internalized
authority derived from parental socialreligious rules and regulations
controls the ego is it is understood as “the conscience”

 in our last
example it is our “conscience” that tells us to remove our elbows from
the table



notice then that our conscience often requires certain things from us
which we fail to achieve and this gives rise to guilt

 for freud the
conscience can be thought of as synonymous with the “guilty conscience”


our ego is punished through guilt by the form of the superego we call
conscience

 furthermore freud says that when the superego fails to
deal properly with the id — when the pleasure principle is repressed —
this forms what he calls neurosis



you can also hopefully see the differences between aquinas and freud


first the obvious point is that for freud the conscience is not the
voice of god

 second unlike aquinas freud thinks that the conscience
could be bad destructive and unhelpful

 the conscience is the way the
ego experiences the authority of the superego

 but the superego is
arrived at through the experiences we have

 and of course we might
have had really bad experiences growing up where parents are stifling
overly authoritarian distant cold hard violent abusive etc

 in
these sorts of cases the conscience would be stifling overly
authoritarian distant etc

 this means that although freud does not
think we can or should get rid of the conscience he does think we
should treat it with a healthy dose of scepticism and hence not be
kowtowed by the “guilt” that is our ego s punishment for falling short
of the superego conscience is the product of our often nonideal
upbringing rather than a divinelyinspired force for good




generally a pursuit of pleasure and happiness

 people become sexually
active fall in love and get married

 this is the stage where we acquire
a fully developed conscience



summary

the notion of “conscience” has appeared for thousands of years in
different cultures even though it has not always been called
“conscience”

 modern christian orthodoxy popularised it and
characterised it in relation to god s voice and guidance

 aquinas
thought that conscience is the way we understand how to apply what we
know

 in aquinas s view our conscience is fallible and might guide us
wrongly

 when our conscience “gets it wrong” we can be either culpable —
through vincible ignorance — or not culpable — through invincible
ignorance



freud is less convinced that conscience is a force for good and he is
certain that it has not got anything to do with god

 for freud
conscience can be either a good or bad

 we can think of our mind as
having three parts the id ego and superego

 the conscience for freud
is the form the superego takes when it is trying to keep the ego in
line

 it is internalized as the voice of authority

 the superego is
about following rules but those rules do not come from “on high” they
derive from the upbringing we have had

 so if we have had a repressive
upbringing then the superego — the voice of conscience — will be
repressive

 how we develop these three features of the mind is through
what freud calls psychosexual development if we do not develop

common student mistakes

 writing conscious when meaning conscience


 confuse synderesis and conscience


 confusing conscience as guidance with conscience as the source of
 knowledge


 believe freud thinks the conscience is always bad


 thinking that for aquinas conscience is way of knowing what is right
 and wrong


 thinking that because the term conscience is new conscience itself
 is a modern invention



issues to consider

1

 do you think you have a conscience

 what does it tell you


2

 what is the difference between synderesis and conscience


3

 do you think that everyone ultimately knows — if they reason
 correctly — what is right and wrong



 of the supposedly invincible knowledge really vincible

 we just
 need to try harder


5

 what are the possible different roles for the conscience


6

 could the conscience be a morally bad thing


7

 why does freud think we need to be cautious about listening to our
 conscience


8

 how does freud s account of conscience relate to his psychosexual
 development theory


9

 what do you think about freud s psychosexual development theory



 of freud s psychosexual development theory


11

 could it ever make sense to talk about animalsrobots having a
 conscience

 if not why not


12

 do you think conscience will still shape our lives in one thousand
 years
