   Following the work of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Karl Marx outlined
   the workings of a political consciousness.

The politics of consciousness

   [edit]

   Consciousness typically refers to the idea of a being who is
   self-aware. It is a distinction often reserved for human beings. This
   remains the original and most common usage of the term. ^[1] For Marx,
   consciousness describes a person's political sense of self. That is,
   consciousness describes a person's awareness of politics. For Marx, an
   authentic consciousness was linked to understanding one's true position
   in History. While Hegel placed God behind the workings of consciousness
   in people, Marx saw the political economy as the engine of mind.^[2]

   In the 20th century, many social movements and intellectuals have
   developed this use of consciousness.

False consciousness

   [edit]
   Main article: False consciousness

   In Marx's view, consciousness was always political, for it was always
   the outcome of politic-economic circumstances. What one thinks of life,
   power, and self, for Marx, is always a product of ideological forces.
--
   the rule of the owners, consumers the rule of corporations. This belief
   in one's own subordination, which comes about through ideology, is, for
   Marx, false consciousness.

   That is, conditions of inequality create ideologies which confuse
--
   the thoughts given to them by the ruling class.^[4]

Consciousness and the political-economy

   [edit]

   For Marx, consciousness is a reflection of the political economy. A
   person's thoughts tend to be shaped by his or her political and
   economic circumstances. He famously wrote, "It is not the consciousness
   of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social
   being that determines their consciousness."

     Perhaps Marx's greatest contribution to modern thought... is his
     comprehensive investigation into the role of Ideology, or how social
     being determines consciousness, which results in certain (for the
     most part unconscious) belief and value systems depending on the
     particular economic infrastructure pertaining at the time. From a
     Marxian point of view all cultural artifacts--religious systems,
     philosophical positions, ethical values--are, naturally enough,
     products of consciousness and as such are subject to these
     ideological pressures.^[5]
