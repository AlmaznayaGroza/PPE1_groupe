When
documenting
your
patient’s
level
of
consciousness
,
you’ll
notice
you
have
a
LOT
of
options
to
choose
from
.


Your
patient
can
be
alert
,
confused
,
in
a
coma
and
anything
in
between
.


Knowing
the
difference
between
each
level
of
consciousness
will
help
you
chart
accurately
and
communicate
your
patient’s
condition
with
precision
.


The
different
levels
of
consciousness
are
:

-
Alert
:
awake
and
responsive
---------------
unresponsive
,
requiring
immediate
intervention
in
order
to
keep
the
patient
safe
.


Had
I
not
known
how
to
describe
this
patient’s
level
of
consciousness
using
standardized
language
,
there
could
have
been
a
huge
miscommunication
between
me
and
the
MD
.


So
,
let’s
go
through
a
quick
example
using
an
entirely
fictitious
patient
.


Ready
?


---------------
all
morning
,
and
you
have
both
ensured
that
the
appropriate
interventions
have
been
instituted
.


In
a
case
with
patient
with
renal
disease
,
you
will
often
see
them
have
decreasing
levels
of
consciousness
as
their
pH
drops
secondary
to
their
metabolic
acidosis
.


With
a
patient
like
this
,
you
might
anticipate
the
MD
ordering
an
ABG
at
some
---------------
telemetry
unit
.



This
whole
topic
of
consciousness
is
so
incredibly
interesting
,
especially
as
it
relates
to
anesthesia
.


If
you’re
interested
in
getting
your
CRNA
someday
,
you
might
find
this
article
fascinating…I
know
