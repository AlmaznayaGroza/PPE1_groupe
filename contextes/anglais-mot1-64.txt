   Collective consciousness (sometimes collective conscience or conscious)
   is a fundamental sociological concept that refers to the set of shared
   beliefs, ideas, attitudes, and knowledge that are common to a social
--
   solidarity with each other. This is why we can form collectives and
   work together to achieve community and functional societies. The
   collective consciousness, or conscience collective as he wrote it in
   French, is the source of this solidarity.
