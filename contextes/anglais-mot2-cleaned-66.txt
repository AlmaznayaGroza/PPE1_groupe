Historical
use
of
collective
consciousness


[edit
]
---------------
The
term
was
introduced
by
the
French
sociologist
Émile
Durkheim
in
his
The
Division
of
Labour
in
Society
in
1893
.


The
French
word
conscience
generally
means
"conscience"
,
"consciousness"
,
"awareness"
,
^
(
[6

)
or
"perception"
.

(

Given
the
multiplicity
of
definitions
,
translators
of
Durkheim

on
which

appropriate

in

he
describes
emergent
characteristics

crowds

He
doesn’t
call
this
collective
consciousness
,
but
‘âme
de
la
foule’
(soul
of
the
crowd
)
.


^
(

This
term
returns
in
Sigmund
Freud’s
book
about
mass
psychology
and
essentially
overlaps
with
Durkheims
concept
of

an

In
societies

the
contents

an
individual

are
largely
shared

with
all

mechanical

The

the

of
a
society

a

—
Émile
Durkheim
^
(
[11

)
---------------
In
Suicide
,
Durkheim
developed
the
concept
of
anomie
to
refer
to
the
social
rather
than
individual
causes
of
suicide
.


This
relates
to
the
concept
of
collective
consciousness
,
as
if
there
is
a
lack
of
integration
or
solidarity
in
society
then
suicide
rates
will
be
higher
.

Antonio
Gramsci
states
,
“A
collective
consciousness
,
which
is
to
say
a
living
organism
,
is
formed
only
after
the
unification
of
the
multiplicity
through
friction
on
the
part
of
the
individuals
;
nor
can
one
say
that
‘silence’
is
not
a
multiplicity
.

”
^
(

A
form
of
collective
consciousness
can
be
formed
from
Gramsci
'
s
conception
that
the
presence
of
a
hegemony
can
mobilize
the
collective
consciousness
of
those
oppressed
by
the
ruling
ideas
of
society
,
or
the
ruling
hegemony
.


Collective
consciousness
can
refer
to
a
multitude
of
different
individual
forms
of
consciousness
coalescing
into
a
greater
whole
.


In
Gramsci
'
s
view
,
a
unified
whole
is
composed
of
solidarity
among
its
different
constituent
parts
,
and
therefore
,
this
whole
cannot
be
uniformly
the
same
.


The
unified
whole
can
embrace
different
forms
of
consciousness
(or
individual
experiences
of
social
reality
)
,
which
coexist
to
reflect
the
different
experiences
of
the
marginalized
peoples
in
a
given
society
.


This
agrees
with
Gramsci
'
s
theory
of
Marxism
and
class
struggle
applied
to
cultural
contexts
.


Cultural
Marxism
(as
distinguished
from
the
right-wing
use
of
the
term
)
embodies
the
concept
of
collective
consciousness
.


It
incorporates
social
movements
that
are
based
on
some
sort
of
collective
identity
;
these
identities
can
include
,
for
instance
,
gender
,
sexual
orientation
,
race
,
and
ability
,
and
can
be

relationship
between
State
and
society
that
in
Gramsci

s
view
emerged
during
the
age
of
mass
politics
.

(

Collective
organisms
can
express
collective
consciousness
.


Whether
this
form
of
expression
finds
itself
in
the
realm
of
the
state
or
the
realm
of
society
is
up
to
the
direction
that
the
subjects
take
in
expressing
their
collective
consciousness
.


In
Gramsci
'
s
Prison
Notebooks
,
the
ongoing
conflict
between
civil
society
,
the
bureaucracy
,
and
the
state
necessitates
the
emergence
of
a
collective
consciousness
that
can
often
act
as
an
intermediary
between
these
different
realms
.


The
public
organizations
of
protest
,
such
as
labor
unions
and
anti-war
organizations
,
are
vehicles
that
can
unite
multiple
types
of
collective
consciousness
.


Although
identity-based
movements
are
necessary
for
the
progress
of
democracy
and
can
generate
collective
consciousness
,
they
cannot
completely
do
so
without
a
unifying
framework
.


This
is
why
anti-war
and
labor
movements
provide
an
avenue
that
has
united
various
social
movements
under
the
banner
of
a
multiple
collective
consciousness
.


This
is
also
why
future
social
movements
need
to
have
an
ethos
of
collective
consciousness
if
they
are
to
succeed
in
the
long-term
.

Knowledge
in
a
sociological
sense
is
derived
from
social
conditions
and
social
realities
.


Collective
consciousness
also
reflects
social
realities
,
and
sociological
knowledge
can
be
gained
through
the
adoption
of
a
collective
consciousness
.


Many
different
disciplines
such
as
philosophy
and
literature
examine
collective
consciousness
from
different
lenses
.


These
different
disciplines
reach
a
similar
understanding
of
a
collective
consciousness
despite
their
different
approaches
to
the
subject
.


The
inherent
humanness
in
the
idea
of
collective
consciousness
refers
to
a
shared
way
of
thinking
among
human
beings
in
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
.



Collective
consciousness
can
provide
an
understanding
of
the
relationship
between
self
and
society
.


As
Zukerfeld
states
,
“Even
though
it
impels
us
,
as
a
first
customary
gesture
,
to
analyse
the
subjective

(such
as
individual
consciousness
)
or
intersubjective
bearers
(such
as
the
values
of
a
given
society
)
,
in
other
words
those
which
Marxism
and
sociology
examine
,
now
we
can
approach
them
in

Zukerfeld
as

and
Marxism

Cognitive
materialism
is
based
on
a
kind
of
collective
consciousness
of
the
mind
.


This
consciousness
can
be
used
,
with
cognitive
materialism
as
a
guiding
force
,
by
human
beings
in
order
to
critically
analyze
society
and
social
conditions
.

It
is
suggested
that
these
different
national
behaviors
vary
according
to
the
different
collective
consciousness
between
nations
.


This
illustrates
that
differences
in
collective
consciousness
can
have
practical
significance
.



According
to
a
theory
,
the
character
of
collective
consciousness
depends
on
the
type
of
mnemonic
encoding
used
within
a
group
(Tsoukalas
,
2007
)
.


The
specific
type
of
encoding
used
has
a
predictable
influence
on
the
---------------

In
a
case
study
of
a
Serbian
folk
story
,
Wolfgang
Ernst
examines
collective
consciousness
in
terms
of
forms
of
media
,
specifically
collective
oral
and
literary
traditions
.


"Current
discourse
analysis
drifts
away
from
the

'
culturalist
turn
'

of
the
last
two
or
three
decades
and
its
concern
with
individual
and
collective
memory
as
an
extended
target
of
historical
research"
.


^
(
[19

)
There
is
still
a
collective
consciousness
present
in
terms
of
the
shared
appreciation
of
folk
stories
and
oral
traditions
.


Folk
stories
enable
the
subject
and
the
audiences
to
come
together
around
a
common
experience
and
a
