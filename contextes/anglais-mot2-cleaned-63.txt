Is
Consciousness
Part
of
the
Fabric
of
the
Universe
?



A
theory
called
panpsychism
proposes
that
consciousness
is
a
fundamental
aspect
of
reality

---------------
Galileo
recognized
that
not
everything
was
amenable
to
a
quantitative
approach
.


Such
things
as
colors
,
tastes
and
smells
“are
no
more
than
mere
names
,”
Galileo
declared
,
for
“they
reside
only
in
consciousness
.

”
These
qualities
aren’t
really
out
there
in
the
world
,
he
asserted
,
but
exist
only
in
the
minds
of
creatures
that
perceive
them
.


“Hence
if
the
---------------
Since
Galileo’s
time
the
physical
sciences
have
leaped
forward
,
explaining
the
workings
of
the
tiniest
quarks
to
the
largest
galaxy
clusters
.


But
explaining
things
that
reside
“only
in
consciousness”—the
red
of
a
sunset
,
say
,
or
the
bitter
taste
of
a
lemon—has
proven
far
more
difficult
.


Neuroscientists
have
identified
a
number
of
neural
correlates
of
consciousness—brain
states
associated
with
specific
mental
states—but
have
not
explained
how
matter
forms
minds
in
the
first
place
.


As
philosopher
Colin
McGinn
put
it
in
a
1989
paper
,
“Somehow
,
we
feel
,
the
water
of
the
physical
brain
is
turned
into
the
wine
of
consciousness
.

”
Philosopher
David
Chalmers
famously
dubbed
this
quandary the
“hard
problem”
of
consciousness
.

*

Scholars
recently
gathered
to
debate
the
problem
at
Marist
College
in
Poughkeepsie
,
N
.

Y
.


,
during
a
two-day
workshop
focused
on
an
idea
known
as panpsychism
.


The
concept
proposes
that
consciousness
is
a
fundamental
aspect
of
reality
,
like
mass
or
electrical
charge
.


The
idea
goes
back
to
antiquity—Plato
took
it
seriously—and
has
had
some
prominent
supporters
---------------
hall
with
floor-to-ceiling
windows
overlooking
the
Hudson
River
,
roughly
two
dozen
scholars
probed
the
possibility
that
perhaps
it’s
consciousness
all
the
way
down
.



Part
of
the
appeal
of
panpsychism
is
that
it
appears
to
provide
a
---------------
particles
might
be
somehow
aware
.


He
said
in
a
TED
Talk
that
a
photon
“might
have
some
element
of
raw
,
subjective
feeling
,
some
primitive
precursor
to
consciousness
.

”
Also
on
board
with
the
idea
is
neuroscientist
Christof
Koch
,
who
noted
in
his
2012
book
Consciousness
that
if
one
accepts
consciousness
as
a
real
phenomenon
that’s
not
dependent
on
any
particular
material—that
it’s
“substrate-independent
,”
as
philosophers
put
it—then
“it
is
a
simple
step
to
conclude
that
the
---------------

Yet
panpsychism
runs
counter
to
the
majority
view
in
both
the
physical
sciences
and
in
philosophy
that
treats
consciousness
as
an
emergent
phenomenon
,
something
that
arises
in
certain
complex
systems
,
such
as
human
brains
.


In
this
view
,
individual
neurons
are
not
conscious
,
but
---------------
theories
,
“most
physicists
think
about
experiments
,”
he
said
.


“I
think
they
should
be
thinking
,
‘Is
my
theory
compatible
with
consciousness
?

’—because
we
know
that’s
real
.

”

Many
philosophers
at
the
meeting
appeared
to
share
Goff’s
concern
that
physicalism
falters
when
it
comes
to
consciousness
.


“If
you
know
every
last
detail
about
my
brain
processes
,
you
still
wouldn’t
know
what
it’s
like
to
be
me
,”
says
Hedda
Hassel
Mørch
,
a
philosopher
at
Inland
Norway
---------------

But
panpsychism
attracts
many
critics
as
well
.


Some
point
out
that
it
doesn’t
explain
how
small
bits
of
consciousness
come
together
to
form
more
substantive
conscious
entities
.


Detractors
say
that
this
puzzle
,
known
as
the
“combination
problem
,”
amounts
to
panpsychism’s
own
version
---------------
divergence
of
their
worldviews
quickly
became
apparent
.


Goff
said
that
physicalism
has
led
“precisely
nowhere
,”
and
suggested
that
the
very
idea
of
trying
to
explain
consciousness
in
physical
terms
was
incoherent
.


Carroll
argued
that
physicalism
is
actually
doing
quite
well
and
that
although
consciousness
is
one
of
many
phenomena
that
can’t
be
inferred
from
the
goings-on
at
the
microscopic
level
,
it
is
nonetheless
a
real
,
emergent
feature
of
the
macroscopic
world
.


He
offered
the
---------------
in
the
black
and
white
room”)
,
as
well
as
the
“zombie”
argument
.


Both boil
down
to
the
same
key
question
:
Is
there
something
about
consciousness
that
cannot
be
accounted
for
by
physical
facts
alone
?


Much
of
the
rhetorical
ping-pong
between
Goff
and
Carroll
amounted
to
Goff
answering
yes
to
that
question
and
Carroll
answering
no
.


---------------
Paul
Draper
,
a
philosopher
at
Purdue
University
who
participated
via
Zoom
,
talked
about
a
subtly
different
idea
known
as
“psychological
ether
theory”—essentially
that
brains
don’t
produce
consciousness
but
rather
make
use
of
consciousness
.


In
this
view
,
consciousness
was
already
there
before
brains
existed
,
like
an
all-pervasive
ether
.


If
the
idea
is
correct
,
he
writes
,
“then
(in
all
likelihood)
God
exists
.

”
---------------
increasingly
popular
idea
in
physics
lately
that
space
and
time
may
not
be
fundamental
but
may
instead
be
emergent
phenomena
themselves
.

)
The
deeper
entity
related
to
consciousness
,
Hoffman
suggests
,
may
consist
of
“subjects
and
experiences”
that
he
says
“are
entities
beyond
spacetime
,
not
within
spacetime
.

”
He
developed
this
idea
in
a
2023
paper
entitled
“Fusions
of
Consciousness
.

Smolin

Institute

problem
.


“Critiquing
physicalism
on
the
basis
that
it
has
‘failed’
is
willful
mischaracterization
,”
he
says
.


“It’s
doing
just
fine
,
as
progress
in
consciousness
science
readily
attests
.

”
In
a
recently
published
article
in
the
Journal
of
Consciousness
Studies
,
Seth
adds
:
“Asserting
that
consciousness
is
fundamental
and
ubiquitous
does
nothing
to
shed
light
on
the
way
an
experience
of
blueness
is
the
way
it
is
,
and
not
some
other
way
.


Nor
does
it
explain
anything
about
the
possible
functions
of
consciousness
,
nor
why
consciousness
is
lost
in
states
such
as
dreamless
sleep
,
general
anaesthesia
,
and
coma
.

”

Even
those
who
lean
toward
panpsychism
sometimes
seem
hesitant
to
dive
into
the
deep
end
.


As
Garcia
put
it
,
in
spite
of
the
allure
of
a
universe
imbued
with
consciousness
,
“I
would
love
to
be
talked
out
of
it
.
