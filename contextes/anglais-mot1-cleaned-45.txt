freedom of conscience is one of the fundamental freedoms protected by
section 2 of the canadian charter of rights and freedoms

1

what is the legal impact of this freedom



ultimately the freedom of conscience constitutionally recognizes “the
centrality of individual conscience and the inappropriateness of
governmental intervention to constrain its manifestation

”2 in fact
the supreme court has ruled that “an emphasis on individual conscience
and individual judgment lies at the heart of our democratic political
tradition

 the ability of each citizen to make free and informed

what is legally protected from government interference



the only supreme court case considering the freedom of conscience
directly is r v morgentaler

4 this 1988 case dealt with the
constitutionality of abortion laws

 justice wilson stated “the
decision whether or not to terminate a pregnancy is essentially a moral
decision and the conscience of the individual must be
paramount

”5 she also held that the freedoms guaranteed by section
2a “should be broadly construed to extend to conscientiouslyheld


without guidance from the supreme court lower courts have had to figure
out on their own what the freedom of conscience protects

 from the
limited jurisprudence that exists we know “the guarantee of freedom
of conscience is directed at an individual s overarching normative
value system

”7 if a person s actions are not motivated by a
“comprehensive value system” in a secular context  then they are not
protected by section 2a

8 this can be quite limiting when people
have argued that their freedom of conscience was violated by mandatory
seatbelt laws for example their arguments failed because their
objections were not supported by a comprehensive value system



 insubstantial infringements upon a person s conscience are also
outside of the scope of the guarantee

9 this is a limitation that all
the fundamental freedoms share the freedom of religion for instance


one of the few lower court decisions solely considering the freedom of
conscience rather than conscience and religion together was maurice v
canada attorney general

11 mr

 maurice wanted to receive vegetarian
meals in prison

 originally he was provided with these meals in

successfully claimed that since he remained vegetarian for
conscientious reasons this was a violation of his freedom of
conscience

12 the federal court agreed declaring that the “charter 
entitles the applicant to a vegetarian diet

”13

the freedom of conscience garnered some attention in 2015 when the
supreme court decided carter v canada attorney general

 in that case
a number of interveners claimed that providing access to
physicianassisted dying would infringe the freedom of conscience of
medical professionals

14 this argument went beyond the scope of what
needed to be decided in that case

 however the court noted that
physicianassisted dying was indeed a “matter of conscience” and that at
some point “the charter rights of patients and physicians will need to
be reconciled

”15

what are the limitations on the freedom of conscience



while the freedom of conscience is a fundamental freedom it is not
absolute

 as with all other rights and freedoms in the charter if a
breach of this freedom is found by a court the government can argue
