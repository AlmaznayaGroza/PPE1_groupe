What
is
Freedom
of
Conscience
?




Whether
they’re
happening
inside
the
Church
or
out
in
the
public
square
,
debates
about
how
far
freedom
of
conscience
extends
can
be
confusing
.


Should
Christians
be
compelled
to
take
a
vaccine
that’s
been
tested
on
the
fetal
remains
of
an
aborted
child
?


Should
Christian
business
owners
have
a
right
to
refuse
a
service
that
would
violate
their
conscience
,
like
baking
a
wedding
cake
for
a
same-sex
ceremony
?


How
do
Christians
respond
to
government
mandates
or
policies
that
they
cannot
follow
in
good
conscience
?


And
how
do
we
deal
with
conscientious
disagreement
within
the
Church
?



The
specifics
of
freedom
of
conscience
can
be
complex
and
nuanced
and
are
often
misunderstood
.


Abraham
Kuyper
called
the
conscience
:

“the
shield
of
the
human
person
,
the
root
of
civil
liberties
,
the
source
---------------

Why
is
it
so
important
?


To
answer
that
question
,
let’s
begin
by
looking
at
what
the
conscience
is
and
is
not
.



What
is
“conscience”
?



Definitions
of
conscience
vary
,
but
they
center
around
the
idea
of
what
someone
believes
to
be
right
and
wrong
.


The
conscience
is
a
moral
compass
that
helps
direct
people’s
actions
.


In
that
sense
,
conscience
is
personal
and
subjective
because
it
condemns
or
excuses
one’s
own
conduct
,
not
that
of
another
person
–
after
all
,
you
don’t
get
a
guilty
conscience
because
of
someone
else’s
behavior
.



However
,
conscience
is
also
based
on
an
objective
and
general
standard
.


The
Bible
explains
that
the
conscience
is
given
by
God
to
both
Christians
and
non-Christians
and
it
helps
people
apply
their
knowledge
of
right
and
wrong
to
their
behavior
,
both
past
actions
and
decisions
about
future
actions
.


The
New
Testament
also
speaks
of
the
importance
of
having
a
good
conscience
by
following
its
direction
and
doing
what
is
right
(see
Rom
.


2
:15
,
1
Tim
.


1
:5)
.



[]Christian
political
scientist
David
Koyzis
,
in
his
book
We
Answer
to
Another
,
tells
a
story
about
the
Milgram
Experiment
which
relates
well
to
conscience
.


The
experiment
was
a
study
designed
to
look
at
how
people
respond
to
authority
.


The
experimenter
would
select
two
participants
and
assign
one
the
role
of
teacher
,
while
another
volunteer
would
be
given
---------------
and
answerable
to
a
higher
authority
.



Ultimately
,
the
foundation
for
freedom
of
conscience
is
found
in
the
sovereignty
of
God
.


Every
human
being
has
various
authorities
in
their
lives
,
such
as
parents
,
employers
,
church
leadership
,
or
civil
government
.


Each
of
these
has
legitimate
authority
over
us
,
but
that
authority
is
also
limited
.


The
only
One
who
is
sovereign
over
the
conscience
is
God
,
and
if
another
authority
commands
us
to
do
what
we
believe
is
sin
–
what
we
believe
violates
how
God
wants
us
to
act
–
then
we
can
appeal
to
freedom
of
conscience
.


The
conscience
is
a
shield
that
protects
against
the
abuse
of
authority
and
points
instead
to
the
one
Higher
Authority
.



Conscience
and
the
public
square

Debates
around
conscience
are
becoming
increasingly
relevant
in
our
society
and
are
most
noticeable
within
certain
vocations
.


Can
medical
professionals
refuse
to
help
a
patient
access
abortion
,
assisted
---------------

Today
it’s
often
Christians
who
are
being
pressured
to
violate
their
conscience
.


However
,
there
are
others
who
seek
the
same
protections
for
their
conscience
.


It’s
this
freedom
that
an
atheist
doctor
appeals
to
when
he
determines
he
cannot
participate
in
euthanasia
,
based
on
his
oath
to
do
no
harm
.


And
what
of
the
fashion
designers
,
back
in
2016
,
who
---------------

For
Christians
,
the
answer
to
the
questions
above
might
be
easy
.


But
we
have
our
own
disputes
about
conscience
within
the
Church
as
well
,
such
as
what
kind
of
entertainment
is
permissible
or
what
it
looks
like
to
honor
the
Sabbath
Day
outside
of
corporate
worship
.



When
conscience
pricks

Of
note
,
the
strongest
commands
of
conscience
are
often
negative
,
in
terms
of
what
you
are
not
permitted
to
do
,
rather
than
what
you
may
or
must
do
.


For
example
,
if
you
use
foul
language
,
your
conscience
will
likely
bother
you
more
than
if
you
fail
to
correct
someone
else
using
such
language
.


Or
,
if
a
publisher
prints
pro-abortion
pamphlets
that
he
objects
to
,
his
conscience
will
make
him
feel
guilty
more
than
if
he
fails
to
promote
life
as
he
believes
he
ought
.



When
the
conscience
commands
a
person
not
to
do
something
,
the
command
is
about
a
very
specific
action
.


Alternatively
,
if
the
command
is
instead
to
act
on
something
good
,
there
are
often
various
ways
of
pursuing
that
good
.



Conscience
and
the
Church

Because
of
sin
,
no
person’s
conscience
is
perfectly
aligned
with
what
God
commands
in
His
Word
.


The
chart
below
is
based
on
one
from
a
helpful
book
titled
Conscience
:
What
It
Is
,
How
To
Train
It
,
and
Loving
Those
Who
Differ
,
by
Andrew
Naselli
and
J
.

D
.


Crowley
.


The
authors
used
it
to
explain
the
difference
between
two
people’s
consciences
,
and
how
they
compare
to
God’s
will
.


The
letters
within
the
chart
refer
to
different
rules
or
principles
of
right
and
wrong
.



Both
Arnold
and
Zoey
have
added
rules
to
their
conscience
that
are
not
commanded
in
Scripture
.


For
example
,
perhaps
Arnold
has
a
history
of
alcohol
abuse
in
his
family
,
so
he
adds
letter
‘C’
which
commands
him
---------------
Arnold’s
belief
that
he
must
not
play
cards
or
any
games
involving
dice
.


Arnold
and
Zoey
have
also
both
failed
to
include
letter
‘B’
in
their
conscience
.


Perhaps
this
is
a
failure
to
consistently
honor
the
Sabbath
Day
,
and
their
consciences
no
longer
accuse
them
for
it
.


However
,
Arnold
and
Zoey’s
consciences
are
both
aligned
with
God’s
will
in
letters
‘J’
through
‘M
,’
where
they
have
rightly
applied
biblical
principles
and
commands
to
their
lives
and
consciences
.


The
natural
tendency
is
to
think
that
if
another
person
has
more
rules
than
us
,
they
are
legalistic
.


Alternatively
,
if
they
have
fewer
rules
,
they
are
failing
to
live
as
Christians
.


However
,
Scripture
remains
the
standard
to
which
we
must
seek
to
align
our
conscience
.



[]

The
conscience
can
easily
become
oversensitive
by
including
rules
that
are
not
matters
of
right
and
wrong
.


We
see
examples
of
the
Pharisees
in
the
New
Testament
who
created
additional
rules
for
the
Sabbath
and
---------------
we
do
not
abide
by
similar
rules
on
the
Sabbath
.



Alternatively
,
conscience
can
become
desensitized
.


Perhaps
you
use
or
tolerate
foul
language
that
would
have
shocked
you
a
decade
ago
,
or
you
consume
entertainment
that
you
would
have
been
ashamed
of
years
earlier
.


Our
conscience
does
not
always
accurately
tell
us
what
is
sin
and
what
is
not
.


While
it
might
not
always
make
sense
to
follow
conscience
in
relation
to
other
authorities
,
we
have
a
duty
to
obey
it
because
we
cannot
commit
what
we
believe
is
sin
.



At
the
same
time
,
we
should
be
careful
when
dealing
with
the
consciences
of
other
people
.


In
1
Corinthians
8
,
the
Apostle
Paul
talks
about
whether
believers
can
eat
meat
offered
to
idols
and
refers
to
consideration
for
brothers
and
sisters
with
a
weaker
conscience
.


So
,
if
we
believe
a
brother
or
sister
has
a
weaker
conscience
,
we
must
not
be
a
stumbling
block
to
them
and
cause
them
to
disobey
their
conscience
.


On
disputable
issues
,
we
may
realize
that
someone
has
a
weaker
conscience
,
and
we
can
discuss
the
biblical
principles
that
apply
.


Or
perhaps
they
have
a
stronger
conscience
,
and
they
can
help
us
understand
where
our
conscience
is
not
aligned
to
Scripture
.



Again
,
conscience
is
not
meant
to
be
some
wishy-washy
idea
where
everyone
can
believe
what
they
want
,
like
in
the
time
of
the
judges
of
Israel
,
when
“everyone
did
what
was
right
in
his
own
eyes
.

”
There
are
---------------
authorities
versus
our
callings
to
obey
what
God
demands
of
us
?


What
about
masking
,
vaccines
,
etc
.


,
both
within
the
public
square
and
the
Church
?


Christian
conscience
differs
on
these
issues
,
and
believers
can
have
biblical
arguments
for
why
they
think
God
commands
or
prohibits
different
actions
.



What
isn’t
conscience
?



Some
of
us
might
react
to
the
idea
that
conscience
is
a
kind
of
subjective
belief
that
is
not
accountable
to
other
people
.


We
can’t
simply
say
,
“well
,
what’s
right
for
you
isn’t
necessarily
right
for
me
.

”
Conscience
is
not
merely
a
personal
preference
like
your
favorite
food
or
music
.


It
is
also
not
license
to
do
whatever
you
please
and
ignore
other
authorities
.


Rather
,
freedom
of
conscience
refers
to
moral
beliefs
that
respect
a
limited
sphere
of
individual
authority
while
still
recognizing
other
legitimate
authorities
that
can
impose
obligations
on
us
.



As
such
,
the
conscience
is
not
unlimited
.


Some
people
might
abuse
the
ability
to
claim
conscientious
objection
out
of
self-interest
or
to
simply
justify
their
actions
.


Authorities
such
as
the
civil
government
,
---------------

However
,
if
the
civil
government
(or
other
authorities)
limits
conscience
,
they
must
provide
good
justification
for
doing
so
and
seek
to
accommodate
conscientious
objectors
as
much
as
they
are
able
,
such
as
through
exemptions
for
freedom
of
conscience
.


Abraham
Kuyper
again
shows
the
importance
of
conscience
,
stating
that
:

“Ten
times
better
is
a
state
in
which
a
few
eccentrics
can
make
themselves
a
laughingstock
for
a
time
by
abusing
freedom
of
conscience
,
than
a
state
in
which
these
eccentricities
are
prevented
by
violating
conscience
itself
.

”

Conclusion

Ultimately
,
conscience
belongs
to
an
individual
and
is
accountable
to
God
.


However
,
it
should
also
be
rooted
in
Biblical
commands
and
principles
.


Increasingly
,
we
encounter
disagreements
in
the
Church
about
various
issues
,
while
in
the
public
square
some
Christians’
jobs
are
threatened
because
the
State
fails
to
recognize
conscience
.


On
many
matters
,
Christians
will
refuse
to
do
something
they
believe
is
evil
even
if
others
do
not
believe
the
action
is
wrong
.


The
Church
has
an
---------------
according
to
moral
standards
based
on
the
will
and
Sovereignty
of
God
.


Wherever
we
find
ourselves
,
let’s
seek
to
say
,
“I
myself
always
strive
to
have
a
conscience
without
offense
toward
God
and
men”
(Acts
24
:16)
.

Human
Rights

Should
Christians
be
free
to
obey
our
conscience
?



In
recent
years
there’s
been
a
worrying
downward
trend
for
religious
---------------
through
human
rights
commissions
,
or
through
lawsuits
–
to
participate
in
same-sex
weddings
in
violation
of
these
various
business
peoples
'

consciences
.


Each
of
these
Christian
business
people
said
they
would
bake
,
cater
,
arrange
flowers
,
print
invitations
,
take
photos
,
print
T-shirts
,
etc
.


for
a
gay
person
'
s
birthday
or
retirement
party
or
any
---------------
marriage
or
a
specific
act
that
fundamentally
violates
God
'
s
design
for
marriage
.


Stand
up
for
others
I
know
of
Christians
who
can
,
with
a
clean
conscience
,
bake
,
photograph
,
etc
.


a
gay
wedding
.


And
I
know
some
who
can
'
t
(see
1
Cor
.


8)
.


This
is
a
legitimate
discussion
to
have
between
Christians
.


The
much
bigger
question
is
:
should
the
State
force
the
---------------
in
any
way
,
in
a
gay
marriage
,
I
believe
you
'
ve
ripped
the
rug
from
under
yourself
–
if
it
is
fine
for
the
State
to
violate
other
Christians’
consciences
this
time
,
what
'
s
to
prevent
them
from
violating
yours
next
?


If
a
Christian
photographer
has
to
shoot
a
gay
wedding
,
does
a
church
have
to
rent
their
hall
for
a
gay
wedding
?
