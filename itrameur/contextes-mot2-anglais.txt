this
inward
looking
and
subjective
character
of
conscience
is
also
reflected
in
the
etymological
relation
between
the
notion
of
“conscience”
and
that
of
consciousness
.


only
after
the
17
^
(th
)
century
did
“consciousness”
start
to
be
used
with
a
distinct
meaning
referring
to
the
psychological
and
phenomenal
dimension
of
the
mind
,
rather
than
to
its
moral
dimension
(for
an
account
of
the
terminological

(kant

(fuss

.


the
subjective
character
of
conscience
implies
that
the
motivational
force
must
come
entirely
from
within
the
individual
,

history
and
class

(1923
)

class
consciousness
,
as
described
by
georg
lukács
'
s
famous
history
and
class
consciousness
(1923
)
,
is
opposed
to
any
psychological
conception
of
consciousness
,
which
forms
the
basis
of
individual
or
mass
psychology

(see
freud
or
,
before
him
,
gustave
le
bon
)
.


according
to
lukács
,
each
social
class
has
a
determined
class
consciousness
which
it
can
achieve
.


in
effect
,
as
opposed
to
the
liberal
conception
of
consciousness
as
the
basis
of
individual
freedom
and
of
the
social
contract
,
marxist
class
consciousness
is
not
an
origin
,
but
an
achievement
(i
.

e
.


it
must
be
"earned"
or
won
)
.


hence
,
it
is
never
assured
:
the
proletariat
'
s
class
consciousness
is
the
result
of
a
permanent
struggle
to
understand
the
"concrete
totality"
of
the
historical
process
.



according
to
lukács
,
the
proletariat
was
the
first
class
in
history
that
may
achieve
true
class
consciousness
,
because
of
its
specific
position
highlighted
in
the
communist
manifesto
as
the
"living
negation"
of
capitalism
.


all
others
classes
,
including
the
bourgeoisie
,
are
limited
to
a
"false
consciousness"
which
impedes
them
from
understanding
the
totality
of
history
:
instead
of
understanding
each
specific
moment
as
a
portion
of
a
supposedly
deterministic
historical
process
,
they
---------------
thought
as
a
specific
phase
of
history
,
but
is
naturalized
and
thought
of
as
an
eternal
solidified
part
of
history
.


says
lukács
,
this
"false
consciousness"
,
which
forms
ideology
itself
,
is
not
a
simple
error
as
in
classical
philosophy
,
but
an
illusion
which
cannot
be
dispelled
.



---------------
even
if
the
bourgeois
loses
his
individual
point
of
view
in
an
attempt
to
grasp
the
reality
of
the
totality
of
society
and
of
the
historical
process
,
he
is
condemned
to
a
form
of
false
consciousness
.


as
an
individual
,
he
will
always
see
the
collective
result
of
individual
actions
as
a
form
of
"objective
law"
to
which
he
must
submit
himself
---------------
by
contrast
,
the
proletariat
would
be
,
according
to
lukács
,
the
first
class
in
history
with
the
possibility
to
achieve
a
true
form
of
class
consciousness
,
granting
it
knowledge
of
the
totality
of
the
historical
process
.



---------------
thus
,
knowledge
of
itself
is
also
,
necessarily
,
knowledge
of
the
reality
and
of
the
totality
of
the
historical
process
.


the
proletariat
'
s
class
consciousness
is
not
immediate
;
class
consciousness
must
not
be
mistaken
either
with
the
consciousness
of
one
'
s
future
and
collective
interests
,
opposed
to
personal
immediate
interests
.



the
possibility
of
class
consciousness
is
given
by
the
objective
process
of
history
,
which
transforms
the
proletariat
into
a
commodity
,
hence
objectifying
it
.


class
consciousness
is
thus
not
a
simple
subjective
act
:
"as
consciousness
here
is
not
the
consciousness
of
an
object
opposed
to
itself
,
but
the
object
'
s
consciousness
,
the
act
of
being
conscious
of
oneself
disrupts
the
objectivity
form
of
its
object"
(in
"reification
and
the
proletariat
'
s
consciousness"
§3
,
iii
"the
proletariat
'
s
point
of
view"
)
.


in
other
words
,
instead
of
the
bourgeois
subject
and
its
corresponding
ideological
concept
of
individual
free
will
,
the
proletariat
has
been
transformed
into
an
object
(a
commodity
)
which
,
when
it
takes
consciousness
of
itself
,
transforms
the
very
structure
of
objectivity
,
that
is
of
reality
.



this
specific
role
of
the
proletariat
is
a
consequence
of
its
specific
position
;
thus
,
for
the
first
time
,
consciousness
of
itself
(class
consciousness
)
is
also
consciousness
of
the
totality
(knowledge
of
the
entire
social
and
historical
process
)
.


through
dialectical
materialism
,
the
proletariat
understands
that
what
the
individual
bourgeois
conceived
---------------
so-called
"laws"
governing
capitalism
into
universal
principles
,
valid
in
all
times
and
places
,
are
criticized
by
lukács
as
a
form
of
false
consciousness
.



as
the
"expression
of
the
revolutionary
process
itself"
,
dialectical
materialism
,
which
is
the
only
theory
with
an
understanding
of
the
totality
of
the
historical
process
,
is
the
theory
which
may
help
the
proletariat
in
its
"struggle
for
class
consciousness"
.


although
lukács
does
not
contest
the
marxist
primacy
of
the
economic
base
on
the
ideological
superstructure
(not
to
be
mistaken
with
vulgar
economic
determinism
)
,
he
considers
that
there
is
a
place
for
autonomous
struggle
for
class
consciousness
.



in
order
to
achieve
a
unity
of
theory
and
praxis
,
theory
must
not
only
---------------
"expression
of
the
revolutionary
process
itself"
.


in
turn
,
a
theory
which
has
as
its
goal
helping
the
proletariat
achieve
class
consciousness
must
first
be
an
"objective
theory
of
class
consciousness"
.


however
,
theory
in
itself
is
insufficient
,
and
ultimately
relies
on
the
struggle
of
humankind
and
of
the
proletariat
for
consciousness
:
the
"objective
theory
of
class
consciousness
is
only
the
theory
of
its
objective
possibility"
.

von
mises

notions

mises
allowed
that
class

challenges
to
fostering
class
consciousness
[original
blog

fostering
class
consciousness
,
a
cornerstone
of
marxian
economics
,
is
a
complex
and
multifaceted
task
.


the
notion
of
class
consciousness
revolves
around
the
idea
of
workers
recognizing
their
shared
class
interests
and
the
potential
for
collective
action
to
challenge
and
transform
the
existing
socio-economic
system
.


however
,
this
process
is
not
without
its
challenges
.


in
this
section
,
we
delve
into
the
hurdles
and
obstacles
that
often
hinder
the
development
of
class
consciousness
,
exploring
different
perspectives
and
offering
insights
into
the
intricacies
of
this
vital
concept
.

economic
precarity
and
alienation
:
one
of
the
fundamental
challenges
to
fostering
class
consciousness
lies
in
the
economic
precarity
experienced
by
many
workers
.


in
a
society
where
job
insecurity
,
low
wages
,
and
underemployment
are
prevalent

individuals
may
be
too
---------------

individualism
and
consumerism
:
the
prevailing
culture
of
individualism
and
consumerism
in
many
societies
can
undermine
efforts
to
build
class
consciousness
.


people
are
encouraged
to
view
success
in
terms
of
personal
achievements
and
material
possessions
rather
than
collective
well-being
.


the
pursuit
of
personal
aspirations
often
---------------
backgrounds
,
and
identities
.


this
diversity
can
sometimes
lead
to
divisions
within
the
working
class
,
making
it
challenging
to
foster
a
unified
sense
of
class
consciousness
.


issues
such
as
race
,
gender
,
and
ethnicity
can
intersect
with

creating

dynamics

historical
and
cultural
factors
:
the
historical
and
cultural
context
of
a
region
plays
a
significant
role
in
shaping
class
consciousness
.


in
some
places
,
a
strong
tradition
of
workers

movements
and

has
fostered
class
solidarity
,
while

principles
and

the
absence
of
accessible
education
and

programs
can
hinder
the
development
of
class
consciousness
.


effective
education
that
elucidates
the
structures
of
capitalism
and
class
struggle
is
crucial
for
empowering
the
proletariat
.


---------------

.


globalization
and
mobility
:
in
today
'
s
globalized
world
,
the
mobility
of
labor
and
the
integration
of
economies
across
borders
can
complicate
efforts
to
foster
class
consciousness
.


workers
may
identify
more
with
their
profession
or
trade
than
with
a
broader
class
identity
,
as
they
often
compete
with
peers
from
various
countries
.

generational
shifts
:
the
perception
of
class
consciousness
can
also
vary
across
generations

workers
may
have
experienced

conditions

collective
interests

it
is
essential
to
address
these
hurdles
with
nuance
and
creativity
,
recognizing
that
the
path
to
class
consciousness
is
not

requires
tailored
strategies
that

contemporary
relevance

class
consciousness
,
a
concept
deeply
rooted
in
marxist
theory
,
has
long
been
a
subject
of
scholarly
debate
and
practical
application
.


its
contemporary
relevance
cannot
be
overstated
,
as
it
continues
to
shape
discussions
around
labor
rights
,
social
justice
,
and
economic
inequality
.


at
its
core
,
class
consciousness
represents
the
awareness
and
unity
of
the
working
class
,
or
the
proletariat
,
in
recognizing
their
shared
interests
and
struggles
against
the
capitalist
system
.


while
some
may
argue
that
class
consciousness
has
diminished
in
the
face
of
globalization
and
changing
labor
markets
,
others
maintain
that
it
remains
a
potent
force
in
modern
society
.

.


globalization
and
fragmentation
:
in
an
era
marked
by
the
globalization
of
markets
and
the
rise
of
the
gig
economy
,
some
critics
argue
that
traditional
class
consciousness
is
eroding
.


with
workers
increasingly
scattered
across
different
industries
and
geographies
,
they
may
not
identify
as
readily
with
a
unified
working
class
.


however
,
proponents
of
class
consciousness
counter
this
by
pointing
out
that
globalization
has
also
brought
workers
together
through
digital
platforms
and
global
supply
chains
.

this
includes
the
realm
of
class
consciousness

like
the
fight
for

in
the

or
the
"gilets

protests
in

demonstrate
how
digital
platforms
can
amplify
class
consciousness
and
lead
to
collective
action
.

income
inequality
:
the
growing
chasm
between
the
ultra-rich
and
the
working
class
has
brought
class
consciousness
back
into
the
spotlight
.


high-profile
cases
of
income
inequality
,
such
as
the
1%
versus
the
99%
,
have
drawn
attention
to
the
disparities
in
wealth
and
power
.


this
disparity
fuels
class
consciousness
by
highlighting
the
shared
economic
challenges
faced
by
the
majority
of
the
population
.

labor
unions
and
collective
bargaining
:
labor
unions
,
historically
instrumental
in
advancing
the
cause
of
the
working
class
,
continue
to
play
a
vital
role
in
promoting
class
consciousness
.


collective
bargaining
and
strikes
remain
powerful
tools
for
workers
to
assert
their
rights
and
negotiate
better
working
conditions

cultural
and
political
movements
:
cultural
and
political
movements
have
also
contributed

the
revitalization
of
class
consciousness
.


for
example
,
the
resurgence
of
socialist
and
leftist
political
movements
in
different
parts
of
the
world
reflects
a
renewed
interest
in
addressing
class-based
issues
.


these
movements
often
frame
their
agendas
around
economic
justice
and
the
redistribution
of
wealth
,
resonating
with
the
core
tenets
of
class
consciousness
.

the

these
---------------

in
a
world
characterized
by
economic

,
class
consciousness
remains
a
relevant
and
dynamic
concept

while
its
forms

expressions
may
adapt

changing
circumstances

the
fundamental
idea
of
workers
recognizing
their
shared
interests
and

power
continues
to
shape
the
discourse
on
social
and

class
consciousness
is
a
fundamental
concept
in
marxian
theory
,
serving
as
a
cornerstone
in
the
broader
framework
of
marxist
economics
and
social
philosophy
.


at
its
core
,
class
consciousness
refers
to
the
awareness

to
truly
comprehend
the
depth

,
one
must
consider
it
from

the
evolution
of
class
consciousness

class
alienation
:
the
concept
of
alienation
is
closely
linked

when
workers
become
aware
of
their
alienation
from
the
fruits
of
their
labor
and
the
capitalist
system
that
perpetuates
it
,
they

what
is
consciousness
?




your
consciousness
refers
to
your
conscious
experiences
,
your
individual
awareness
of
your
own
internal
thoughts
,
feelings
,
memories
,
and
sensations
.



consciousness
is
often
thought
of
as
a
stream
,
constantly
shifting
according
to
the
ebb
and
flow
of
your
thoughts
and
experiences
of
the
world
around
you
.



"consciousness
is
generally
defined
as
awareness
of
your
thoughts
,
actions
,
feelings
,
sensations
,
perceptions
,

other
mental
processes

that
consciousness
isn

t
just
one
mental
process
but
rather
a
part
of
many

"for

memories
can

why

why
did
the
experience
of
consciousness
evolve
from
our
underlying
brain
physiology
?


despite
being
a
vibrant
area
of
neuroscience
,
current
research
on
consciousness
is
characterised
by
disagreement
and
controversy
–
with
several
rival
theories
in
contention
.



a
recent
scoping
review
of
over
1
,000
articles
identified
over
20
different
theoretical
accounts
.


philosophers
like
david
chalmers
argue
that
no
single
scientific
theory
can
truly
explain
consciousness
.



we
define
consciousness
as
embodied
subjective
awareness
,
including
self
awareness
.


in
a
recent
article
published
in
interalia
(which
is
not
peer
reviewed
)
,
we
argue
that
one
reason
for
this
predicament
is
the
powerful
---------------

we
are
not
alone
.


social
scientist
jacy
reese
anthis
writes
“much
of
the
debate
on
the
fundamental
nature
of
consciousness
takes
the
form
of
intuition
jousting
,
in
which
the
different
parties
each
report
their
own
strong
intuitions
and
joust
them
against
each
other”
.


---------------
because
they
are
powerfully
endorsed
by
social
and
cultural
concepts
such
as
free
will
,
human
rights
,
democracy
,
justice
and
moral
responsibility
.


all
these
concepts
assume
that
consciousness
plays
a
central
controlling
influence
.



---------------
beliefs
can
be
wrong
.


they
can
also
interfere
with
scientific
literacy
.



intuitive
accounts
of
consciousness
ultimately
put
us
in
the
driver’s
seat
as
“captain
of
our
own
ship”
.


we
think
we
know
what
consciousness
is
and
what
it
does
from
simply
experiencing
it
.


mental
thoughts
,
intentions
and
desires
are
seen
as
determining
and
controlling
our
---------------

the
widespread
acceptance
of
these
tacit
intuitive
accounts
helps
explain
,
in
part
,
why
the
formal
study
of
consciousness
was
relegated
to
the
margins
of
mainstream
neuroscience
until
late
20th
century
.



the
problem
for
scientific
models
of
consciousness
remains
accommodating
these
intuitive
accounts
within
a
materialist
framework
consistent
with
the
findings
of
neuroscience
.


while
there
is
no
current
scientific
---------------
social
purpose

if
that’s
the
case
,
why
did
consciousness
,
defined
as
subjective
awareness
,
evolve
?



consciousness
presumably
evolved
as
part
of
the
evolution
of
the
nervous
system
.


according
to
several
theories
the
key
adaptive
function

(providing
an
organism
with
survival
and
reproductive
benefits
)
of
consciousness
is
to
make
volitional
movement
possible
.


and
volition
is
something
we
ultimately
associate
with
will
,
agency
and
individuality
.


it
is
therefore
easy
to
think
that
consciousness
evolved
to
benefit
us
as
individuals
.



humans
are
a
highly
social
species
.


esteban
de
armas/shuttestock

but
we
have
argued
that
consciousness
may
have
evolved
to
facilitate
key
social
adaptive
functions
.


rather
than
helping
individuals
survive
,
it
evolved
to
help
us
broadcast
our
experienced
ideas
and
feelings
into
the
 

the
key
to
this
type
of
leadership
is
precisely
the
consciousness
of
the
act
of
leading
.


it
means
that
being
aware
is
not
just
about
realizing
it
but
also
about
being
capable
of
reflecting
on
our
actions
,
roles
,
and
---------------

a
conscious
leader
is
a
figure
that
is
increasingly
gaining
prominence
in
companies
.


consciousness
applied
to
decision-making
within
an
organization
is
crucial
for
leading
positive
changes
.


why
?


because
it
allows
for
the
consideration
of
different
variables
involved

of
perceptions
,
thoughts
,
and
feelings
;

awareness
.


the
term
is
impossible
to
define
except
in
terms
that
are

unintelligible
without
a
grasp
of
what
consciousness
means
.


many
fall

into
the
trap
of
equating
consciousness
with
self-consciousness—to
be

conscious
it
is
only
necessary
to
be
aware
of
the
external
world
.



consciousness
is
a
fascinating
but
elusive
phenomenon
:
it
is

impossible
to
specify
what
it
is
,
what
it
does
,
or
why
it
has
evolved

nothing
worth

has
been

using

'
awareness
'

,
however
,
as
a
definition
or
synonym
of
consciousness
is
not
a
simple
matter
:


if
awareness
of
the
environment
.


.


.


is
the
criterion
of

consciousness
,
then
even
the
protozoans
are
conscious
.


if
awareness
of

awareness
is
required
,
then
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
great
apes
and

human
infants
are
conscious

[edit

many
philosophers
have
argued
that
consciousness
is
a
unitary
concept
that
is
understood
by
the
majority
of
people
despite
the
difficulty
philosophers
have
had
defining
it
.


^
(
[30

)
max
velmans
proposed
that
the
"everyday
understanding
of
consciousness"
uncontroversially
"refers
to
experience
itself
rather
than
any
particular
thing
that
we
observe
or
experience"
and
he
added
that
consciousness
"is
[therefore
]
exemplified
by
all
the
things
that
we
observe
or
experience"
,

thoughts
,
feelings
,
or
perceptions

velmans
noted
however
,
as
of
2009
,
that
there
was
a
deep
level
of
"confusion
and
internal
division"
^
(
[31
]
)
among
experts
about
the
phenomenon
of
consciousness
,
because
researchers
lacked
"a
sufficiently
well-specified
use
of
the
term

.


.

to
agree
that
they
are
investigating
the
same
thing"
.


^
(
[31

:

)
he
argued
additionally
that
"pre-existing
theoretical
commitments"
to
competing
explanations
of
consciousness
might
be
a
source
of
bias
.



within
the
"modern
consciousness
studies"
community
the
technical
phrase

'
phenomenal
consciousness
'

is
a
common
synonym
for
all
forms
of
awareness
,
or
simply

'
experience
'

,

one
criticism

that
it
begins
with

in
medicine
,
a
"level

terminology
is
used
to
describe
a

'
s
arousal

responsiveness

which
can
be
seen
as
a
continuum
of
states
ranging
from
full
alertness

comprehension
,
through
disorientation
,
delirium
,
loss
of
meaningful
communication
,
and

loss
of
movement

response

painful
stimuli

^
(
[39

issues
of
practical
concern
include
how
the
level
of
consciousness
can
be
assessed
in
severely
ill
,
comatose
,
or
anesthetized
people
,
and
how
to
treat
conditions
in
which
consciousness
is
impaired
or
disrupted
.


^
(
[40

the
degree
or
level
of
consciousness
is
measured
by
standardized
behavior

scales
such
as
the
glasgow
coma

.



---------------

while
historically
philosophers
have
defended
various
views
on
consciousness
,
surveys
indicate
that
physicalism
is
now
the
dominant
position
among
contemporary
philosophers
of
mind
.


^
(
[41

)
for
an
overview
of
the
field
,
approaches
often
include
both
historical
perspectives
---------------

philosophers
differ
from
non-philosophers
in
their
intuitions
about
what
consciousness
is
.


^
(
[42
]
)
while
most
people
have
a
strong
intuition
for
the
existence
of
what
they
refer
to
as
consciousness
,
^
(
[30
]
)
skeptics
argue
that
this
intuition
is
too
narrow
,
either
because
the
concept
of
consciousness
is
embedded
in
our
intuitions
,
or
because
we
all
are
illusions
.


gilbert
ryle
,
for
example
,
argued
that
traditional
understanding
of
consciousness
depends
on
a
cartesian
dualist
outlook
that
improperly
distinguishes
between
mind
and
body
,
or
between
mind
and
world
.


he
proposed
that
we
speak
not
of
minds
,
bodies
,
and
the
world
,
but
of
entities
,
or
identities
,
acting
in
the
world
.


thus
,
by
speaking
of
"consciousness"
we
end
up
leading
ourselves
by
thinking
that
there
is
any
sort
of
thing
as
consciousness
separated
from
behavioral
and
linguistic
understandings
.


^
(

)

---------------

[edit

ned
block
argued
that
discussions
on
consciousness
often
failed
to
properly
distinguish
phenomenal
(p-consciousness
)
from
access

(a-consciousness
)
,
though
these
terms
had
been
used
before
block
.


^
(
[44
]
)
p-consciousness
,
according
to
block
,
is
raw
experience
:
it
is
moving
,
colored
forms
,
sounds
,
sensations
,
emotions
and
feelings
with
our
bodies
and
responses
at
the
center
.


these
experiences
,
considered
independently
of
any
impact
on
behavior
,
are
called
qualia
.


a-consciousness
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
the
phenomenon
whereby
information
in
our
minds
is
accessible
for
verbal
report
,
reasoning
,
and
the
control
of
behavior
.


---------------
conscious
,
and
so
on
.


although
some
philosophers
,
such
as
daniel
dennett
,
have
disputed
the
validity
of
this
distinction
,
^
(
[45
]
)
others
have
broadly
accepted
it
.


david
chalmers
has
argued
that
a-consciousness
can
in
principle
be
understood
in
mechanistic
terms
,
but
that
understanding
p-consciousness
is
much
more
challenging
:
he
calls
this
the
hard
problem
of
consciousness
.


^
(
[46
]
)

some
philosophers
believe
that
block
'
s
two
types
of
consciousness
are
not
the
end
of
the
story
.


william
lycan
,
for
example
,
argued
in
his
book
consciousness
and
experience
that
at
least
eight
clearly
distinct
types
of
consciousness
can
be
identified
(organism
consciousness
;
control
consciousness
;
consciousness
of
;
state/event
consciousness
;
reportability
;
introspective
consciousness
;
subjective
consciousness
;
self-consciousness
)—and
that
even
this
list
omits
several
more
obscure
forms
.


^
(
[47
]
)

there
is
also
debate
over
whether
or
not
a-consciousness
and
p-consciousness
always
coexist
or
if
they
can
exist
separately
.


although
p-consciousness
without
a-consciousness
is
more
widely
accepted
,
there
have
been
some
hypothetical
examples
of
a
without
p
.


block
,
for
instance
,
suggests
the
case
of
a
"zombie"
that
is
computationally
identical
to
a
person
but
without
any
subjectivity
.


however
,
he
remains
somewhat
skeptical
concluding
"i
don
'
t
know
whether
there
are
any
actual
cases
of
a-consciousness
without
p-consciousness
,
but
i
hope
i
have
illustrated
their
conceptual
possibility"
.

distinguishing
consciousness
from
its
contents


[edit
]

sam
harris
observes
:
"at
the
level
of
your
experience
,
you
are
not
a
body
of
cells
,
organelles
,
and
atoms
;
you
are
consciousness
and
its
ever-changing
contents"
.


^
(
[49
]
)
seen
in
this
way
,
consciousness
is
a
subjectively
experienced
,
ever-present
field
in
which
things
(the
contents
of
consciousness
)
come
and
go
.



christopher
tricker
argues
that
this
field
of
consciousness
is
symbolized
by
the
mythical
bird
that
opens
the
daoist
classic
the
zhuangzi
.


this
bird
'
s
name
is
of
a
flock
(peng
鵬
)
,
yet
its
back
is
countless
thousands
of
miles
across
and
its
wings
are
like
clouds
arcing
across
the
heavens
.


"like
of
a
flock
,
whose
wings
arc
across
the
heavens
,
the
wings
of
your
consciousness
span
to
the
horizon
.


at
the
same
time
,
the
wings
of
every
other
being

consciousness
span
to

to

descartes

distinction

and

that

that
there

really
only
one
realm
of

,
of
which
consciousness
and
matter
are
both
aspects
.


each
of
these
categories

contains
numerous
variants

---------------
since
the
dawn
of
newtonian
science
with
its
vision
of
simple
mechanical
principles
governing
the
entire
universe
,
some
philosophers
have
been
tempted
by
the
idea
that
consciousness
could
be
explained
in
purely
physical
terms
.


the
first
influential
writer
to
propose
such
an
idea
explicitly
was
julien
offray
de
la
mettrie
,
in
his
book
man
a
machine

(l
'
homme
machine
)
.


his
arguments
,
however
,
were
very
abstract
.


^
(
[55
]
)
the
most
influential
modern
physical
theories
of
consciousness
are
based
on
psychology
and
neuroscience
.


theories
proposed
by
neuroscientists
such
as
gerald
edelman
^
(
[56

)
and
antonio
damasio
,
^
(
[57

)
and
by
philosophers
such
as
daniel
dennett
,
^
(
[58

)
seek
to
explain
consciousness
in
terms
of
neural
events
occurring
within
the
brain
.


many
other
neuroscientists
,
such
as
christof
koch
,
^
(
[59
]
)
have
explored
the
neural
basis
of
consciousness
without
attempting
to
frame
all-encompassing
global
theories
.


at
the
same
time
,
computer
scientists
working
in
the
field
of
artificial
intelligence
have
pursued
the
goal
of
creating
digital
computer
programs
that
can
simulate
or
embody
consciousness
.


^
(

)

a
few
theoretical
physicists
have
argued
that
classical
physics
is
intrinsically
incapable
of
explaining
the
holistic
aspects
of
consciousness
,
but
that
quantum
theory
may
provide
the
missing
ingredients
.


several
theorists
have
therefore
proposed
quantum
mind
(qm
)
theories
of
consciousness
.


^
(
[61

notable
theories
falling
into
this
category
include
the
holonomic

and
the
orch-or
theory
formulated

stuart

of

as

interpretations

consider
the
arguments
for
an
important
role
of
quantum
phenomena
to
be
unconvincing
.


^
(
[63

)

evidence
is
against
the
notion
of
quantum
consciousness
,

experiment
about
wave
function
collapse
led
by
catalina

suggests
that
quantum

,
is

apart
from
the
general
question
of
the
"hard
problem"
of
consciousness

(which
is
,
roughly
speaking
,
the
question
of
how
mental
experience
can
arise
from
a
physical
basis
^
(
[65
]
)
)
,
a
more
specialized
question
is
how
---------------

many
philosophers
consider
experience
to
be
the
essence
of
consciousness
,
and
believe
that
experience
can
only
fully
be
known
from
the
inside
,
subjectively
.


the
problem
of
other
minds
is
a
philosophical
problem
traditionally
stated
as
the
following
epistemological
question
:
---------------
principle
to
have
an
entity
that
is
physically
indistinguishable
from
a
human
being
and
behaves
like
a
human
being
in
every
way
but
nevertheless
lacks
consciousness
.


^
(
[67

related
issues
have
also
been
studied
extensively
by
greg
littmann
of
the
university
of
illinois
,
^
(
[68

)
and
by
colin
allen
(a
professor
at
the
university
of
pittsburgh
)
regarding
---------------
androids
.


^
(
[69
]
)

the
most
commonly
given
answer
is
that
we
attribute
consciousness
to
other
people
because
we
see
that
they
resemble
us
in
appearance
and
behavior
;
we
reason
that
if
they
look
like
us
and
act
like
us
,
they
must
---------------
understand
what
they
are
saying
.


^
(
[71

)
more
broadly
,
philosophers
who
do
not
accept
the
possibility
of
zombies
generally
believe
that
consciousness
is
reflected
in
behavior
(including
verbal
behavior
)
,
and
that
we
attribute
consciousness
on
the
basis
of
behavior
.


a
more
straightforward
way
of
saying
this
is
that
we
attribute
experiences
to
people
because
of
what
they
can
do
,
including
the
fact
that
they

on
qualia

for

starting
in

an
expanding
community
of
neuroscientists

have
associated
themselves
with
a
field
called

rise
to

and
the

modern
medical
and
psychological
investigations
into
consciousness
are
based
on
psychological
experiments
(including
,
for
example
,
the
investigation
of
priming
effects
using
subliminal
stimuli

and
on
case
studies
of
alterations
in
consciousness
produced
by
trauma
,
illness
,
or
drugs
.


broadly
viewed
,
scientific
approaches
are
based
on
two
core
concepts
.


the
first
identifies
the
content
of
consciousness
with
the
experiences
that
are
reported
by
human
subjects
;
the
second
makes
use
of
the
concept
of
consciousness
that
has
been
developed
by
neurologists
and
other
medical
professionals
who
deal
with
patients
whose
behavior
is
impaired
.


in
either
case
,
the
ultimate
goals
are
to
develop
techniques
for
assessing
consciousness
objectively
in
humans
as
well
as
other
animals
,
and
to
understand
the
neural
and
psychological
mechanisms
that
underlie
it

experimental
research
on

presents
special
difficulties
,
due
to
the
lack
of
a
universally
accepted
operational
definition
.


in
the
majority
of
experiments
that
are
specifically
about
consciousness
,
the
subjects
are
human
,
and
the
criterion
used
is
verbal

:
in

words
,
subjects
are
asked
to
describe
their

and
their
descriptions
are
treated
as

of
the
contents

it
raises
a
number
of
issues
.


^
(
[85

for
one
thing
,
if
verbal

the

another
issue
with
verbal
report
as
a
criterion
is
that
it
restricts
the
field
of

to
humans
who
have
language
:
this
approach
cannot
be
used
to
study
consciousness
in
other
species
,
pre-linguistic
children
,
or
people
with
types

as
a
third
issue
,
philosophers
who
dispute
the
validity
of
the
turing
test
may
feel
that
it
is
possible
,
at
least
in
principle
,
for
verbal
report
to
be
dissociated
from
consciousness
entirely
:
a
philosophical
zombie
may
give
detailed
verbal
reports
of
awareness
in
the
absence
of
any
genuine
awareness
.


^
(
[88

although
verbal
report
is
in
practice
the
"gold
standard"
for
ascribing
consciousness
,
it
is
not
the
only
possible
criterion
.


^
(
[85
]
)
in
medicine
,
consciousness
is
assessed
as
a
combination
of
verbal
behavior
,
arousal
,
brain
activity
,
and
purposeful
movement
.


the
last
three
of
these
can
be
used
as
indicators
of
consciousness
when
verbal
behavior
is
absent
.


^
(
[89

[90

)
the
scientific
literature
regarding
the
neural
bases
of
arousal
and
purposeful
movement
is
very
extensive
.


their
reliability
as
indicators
of
consciousness
is
disputed
,
however
,
due
to
numerous
studies
showing
that
alert
human
subjects
can
be
induced
to
behave
purposefully
in
a
variety
of
ways
in
spite
of
reporting
a
complete
lack
of
awareness
.

schema
of
the
neural
processes
underlying
consciousness
,
from
christof
koch

a
major
part
of
the
scientific
literature
on
consciousness
consists
of
studies
that
examine
the
relationship
between
the
experiences
reported
by
subjects
and
the
activity
that
simultaneously
takes
place
in
their
brains—that
is
,
studies
of
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
.


the
hope
is
to
find
that
activity
in
a
particular
part
of
the
brain
,
or
a
particular
pattern
of
global
brain
activity
,
which
will
be
strongly
---------------

another
idea
that
has
drawn
attention
for
several
decades
is
that
consciousness
is
associated
with
high-frequency
(gamma
band
)
oscillations
in
brain
activity
.


this
idea
arose
from
proposals
in
the
1980s
,
by
christof
von
der
malsburg
and
wolf
singer
,
that

rodolfo
llinás
,
for
example
,
proposed
that
consciousness
results
from
recurrent
thalamo-cortical
resonance
where
the
specific
thalamocortical
systems
(content
)
and
the
non-specific

(centromedial
thalamus
)
thalamocortical
systems
(context

interact
in
---------------

a
number
of
studies
have
shown
that
activity
in
primary
sensory
areas
of
the
brain
is
not
sufficient
to
produce
consciousness
:
it
is
possible
for
subjects
to
report
a
lack
of
awareness
even
when
areas
such
as
the
primary
visual
cortex
(v1
)
show
clear
electrical
responses
to
a
---------------
modulation
of
neural
responses
may
correlate
with
phenomenal
experiences
.


in
contrast
to
the
raw
electrical
responses
that
do
not
correlate
with
consciousness
,
the
modulation
of
these
responses
by
other
stimuli
correlates
surprisingly
well
with
an
important
aspect
of
consciousness
:
namely
with
the
phenomenal
experience
of
stimulus
intensity
(brightness
,
contrast
)
.


in
the
research
group
of
danko
nikolić
it
has
been
shown
that
some
of
the
changes
in
the
subjectively
perceived

sleep
or
in
a
locked-in
state
than
in
those
who
are
in
deep
sleep
or
in
a
vegetative
state
,
^
(
[108

)
making
it
potentially
useful
as
a
quantitative
assessment
of
consciousness
states
.



assuming
that
not
only
humans
but
even
some
non-mammalian
species
are
conscious
,
a
number
of
evolutionary
approaches
to
the
problem
of
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
open
up
.


for
example
,
assuming
that
birds
are
conscious—a
common
assumption
among
neuroscientists
and
ethologists
due
to
the
extensive
cognitive
repertoire
of
birds—there
are
comparative
neuroanatomical
ways
to
validate
some
of
the
principal
,
currently
competing
,
mammalian
consciousness–brain
theories
.


the
rationale
for
such
a
comparative
study
is
that
the
avian
brain
deviates
structurally
from
the
mammalian
brain
.


so
how
similar
are
they
?


what
homologs
can
be

al
.


^
(
[109

is
that
some
of
the
major
theories
for
the
mammalian
brain
^
(
[110
]
[111
]
[112
]
)
also
appear
to
be
valid
for
the
avian
brain
.


the
structures
assumed
to
be
critical
for
consciousness
in
mammalian
brains
have
homologous
counterparts
in
avian
brains
.


thus
the
main
portions
of
the
theories
of
crick
and
koch
,
^
(
[110

)
edelman
and
tononi
,
^
(

)
and
cotterill
^
(
[112

)
seem
to
be
compatible
with
the
assumption
that
birds
are
conscious
.


edelman
also
differentiates
between
what
he
calls
primary
consciousness
(which
is
a
trait
shared
by
humans
and
non-human
animals
)
and
higher-order
consciousness
as
it
appears
in
humans
alone
along
with
human
language
capacity
.


^
(
[111
]
)
certain
aspects
of
the
three
theories
,
however
,
seem
less
easy
to
apply
to
the
hypothesis
of
avian
consciousness
.


for
instance
,
the
suggestion
by
crick
and
koch
that
layer
5
neurons
of
the
mammalian
brain
have
a
special
role
,
seems
difficult
to
apply
to
the
avian
brain
,
since
the
avian
homologs
have
a
different
morphology
.


likewise
,
the
theory
of
eccles
^
(
[113
]
[114
]
)
seems
incompatible
,
since
a
structural
homolog/analogue
to
the
dendron
has
not
been
found
in
avian
brains
.


the
assumption
of
an
avian
consciousness
also
brings
the
reptilian
brain
into
focus
.


the
reason
is
the
structural
continuity
between
avian
and
reptilian
brains
,
meaning
that
the
phylogenetic
origin
of
consciousness
may
be
earlier
than
suggested
by
many

stresses
the
importance
of
the
evolutionary
emergence
of
higher-order
consciousness
in
humans
from
the
historically
older
trait
of
primary
consciousness
which
humans
share
with
non-human
animals
(see
neural

section
above
)
.


these
theories
of
integrative
function
present
solutions
to
two
classic
problems
associated
with
consciousness
:
differentiation
and
unity
.


they
show
how
our
conscious
experience
can
discriminate
between
a
virtually
unlimited
number
of
different
possible
scenes
and
details
(differentiation
)
because
it
integrates
those
details
from
our
sensory
systems
,
while
the
integrative
nature
of
consciousness
in
this
view
easily
explains
how
our
experience
can
seem
unified
as
one
whole
despite
all
of
these
individual
parts
.


however
,
it
remains
unspecified
which
kinds
of
information
are
integrated
in
a
conscious
manner
and
which
kinds
can
be
integrated
without
consciousness
.


nor
is
it
explained
what
specific
causal
role
conscious
integration
plays
,
nor
why
the
same
functionality
cannot
be
achieved
without
consciousness
.


not

and
many

(

as
noted
earlier

even
among
writers

consider

to
be
well-defined

there
is
widespread
dispute

which

(see

thus
,
any
examination
of
the
evolution
of

is
faced
with
great
difficulties
.


nevertheless
,
some
writers
have
argued
that
consciousness

the
standpoint

biology

however

this
test
can
be
used
only
to
detect

not
refute
the
existence

a
positive
result
proves
that
a
machine
is
conscious

a
negative
result
proves
nothing

for
example
,
absence

philosophical
judgments
may
be
caused
by
lack
of
the
machine

s
intellect
,
not
by
absence
of
consciousness

stream
of
consciousness
(psychology
)

william
james
is
usually
credited
with
popularizing
the
idea
that
human
consciousness
flows
like
a
stream
,
in
his
principles
of
psychology
of
1890
.

a
similar
concept
appears
in
buddhist
philosophy
,
expressed
by
the
sanskrit
term
citta-saṃtāna
,
which
is
usually
translated
as
mindstream
or
"mental
continuum"
.


buddhist
teachings
describe
that
consciousness
manifests
moment
to
moment
as
sense
impressions
and
mental
phenomena
that
are
continuously
changing

the
purpose
of
the
buddhist
practice
of
mindfulness
is
to
understand
the
inherent
nature
of
the
consciousness
and
its
characteristics
.

in
the
west
,
the
primary
impact
of
the
idea
has
been
on
literature
rather
than
science
:
"stream
of
consciousness
as
a
narrative
mode"
means
writing
in
a
way
that
attempts
to
portray
the
moment-to-moment
thoughts
and
experiences
of
a
character
.

to
most
philosophers

the
word
"consciousness"
connotes

relationship

and

world

the
canadian
psychiatrist
richard
maurice
bucke
,
author
of
the
1901
book
cosmic
consciousness
:
a
study
in
the
evolution
of
the
human
mind
,
distinguished
between
three
types
of
consciousness
:

'
simple
consciousness
'

,
awareness
of
the
body
,
possessed
by
many
animals
;

'
self
consciousness
'

,
awareness
of
being
aware
,
possessed
only
by
humans
;
and

'
cosmic
consciousness
'

,
awareness
of
the
life
and
order
of
the
universe
,
possessed
only
by
humans
who
have
attained
"intellectual
enlightenment
or
illumination"
.

another
thorough
account
of
the
spiritual
approach
is
ken
wilber
'
s
1977
book
the
spectrum
of
consciousness
,
a
comparison
of
western
and
eastern
ways
of
thinking
about
the
mind
.


wilber
described
consciousness
as
a
spectrum
with
ordinary
awareness
at
one
end
,
and
more
profound
types
of
awareness
at
higher
levels

perhaps
no
aspect
of
mind
is
more
familiar
or
more
puzzling
than
consciousness
and
our
conscious
experience
of
self
and
world
.


the
problem
of
consciousness
is
arguably
the
central
issue
in
current
theorizing
about
the
mind
.


despite
the
lack
of
any
agreed
upon
theory
of
consciousness
,
there
is
a
widespread
,
if
less
than
universal
,
consensus
that
an
adequate
account
of
mind
requires
a
clear
understanding
of
it
and
its
place
in
nature
.


we
need
to
understand
both
what
consciousness
is
and
how
it
relates
to
other
,
nonconscious
,
aspects
of
reality

for
as
long
as
there
have
been
humans
.


neolithic
burial
practices
appear
to
express
spiritual
beliefs
and
provide
early
evidence
for
at
least
minimally
reflective
thought
about
the
nature
of
human
consciousness

(pearson
1999
,
clark
and
riel-salvatore
2001
)
.


preliterate
cultures
have
similarly
been
found
invariably
to
embrace
some
form
of
spiritual
or
at
---------------
nature
of
conscious
awareness
.



nonetheless
,
some
have
argued
that
consciousness
as
we
know
it
today
is
a
relatively
recent
historical
development
that
arose
sometime
after
the
homeric
era
(jaynes
1974
)
.


according
to
this
view
,
earlier
humans
---------------
in
the
ways
we
do
today
.


others
have
claimed
that
even
during
the
classical
period
,
there
was
no
word
of
ancient
greek
that
corresponds
to
“consciousness”
(wilkes
1984
,
1988
,
1995
)
.


though
the
ancients
had
much
to
say
about
mental
matters
,
it
is
less
clear
whether
they
had
any
specific
concepts
or
concerns
for
what
we
now
think
of
as
consciousness
.



although
the
words
“conscious”
and
“conscience”
are
used
quite
---------------

by
the
beginning
of
the
early
modern
era
in
the
seventeenth
century
,
consciousness
had
come
full
center
in
thinking
about
the
mind
.


indeed
from
the
mid-17th
through
the
late
19th
century
,
consciousness
was
widely
regarded
as
essential
or
definitive
of
the
mental
.


rené
descartes
defined
the
very
notion
of
thought
(pensée
)
in
terms
of
reflexive
consciousness
or
self-awareness
.


in
the
principles
of
philosophy
(1640
)
he
wrote
,

---------------

locke
explicitly
forswore
making
any
hypothesis
about
the
substantial
basis
of
consciousness
and
its
relation
to
matter
,
but
he
clearly
regarded
it
as
essential
to
thought
as
well
as
to
personal
identity
.



---------------
mathematical
work
on
differentiation
and
integration
,
offered
a
theory
of
mind
in
the
discourse
on
metaphysics
(1686
)
that
allowed
for
infinitely
many
degrees
of
consciousness
and
perhaps
even
for
some
thoughts
that
were
unconscious
,
the
so
called
“petites
perceptions”
.


leibniz
was
the
first
to
distinguish
explicitly
between
perception
and
apperception
,
i
.

e
.


,
roughly
between
awareness
and
self-awareness
.


in
the
monadology
(1720
)
he
also
offered
his
famous
analogy
of
the
mill
to
express
his
belief
that
consciousness
could
not
arise
from
mere
matter
.


he
asked
his
reader
to
imagine
someone
walking
through
an
expanded
brain
as
one
would
walk
through

mill

despite
leibniz
'
s
recognition
of
the
possibility
of
unconscious
thought
,
for
most
of
the
next

centuries

domains
of
thought
and
consciousness
were
regarded
as

the
purely
associationist
approach

critiqued

by
immanuel
kant
(1787

who
argued
that
an
adequate
account
of
experience
and
phenomenal
consciousness
required
a
far
richer
structure
of
mental
and
intentional
organization
.


phenomenal
consciousness
according
to
kant
could
not
be

martin
heidegger
(1927

,
maurice
merleau-ponty
(1945

and
others
who
expanded
the
study
of
consciousness
into
the
realm
of
the
social
,
the
bodily
and
the
interpersonal
.



at
the
outset
of
modern
scientific
psychology
in
the
mid-nineteenth
century
,
the
mind
was
still
largely
equated
with
consciousness
,
and
introspective
methods
dominated
the
field
as
in
the
work
of
wilhelm
wundt
(1897
)
,
hermann
von
helmholtz
(1897
)
,
william
james
(1890
)
and
alfred
titchener
(1901
)
.


however
,
the
relation
of
consciousness
to
brain
remained
very
much
a
mystery
as
expressed
in
t
.


h
.


huxley
'
s
famous
remark
,


how
it
is
that
anything
so
remarkable
as
a
state
of
consciousness

comes
about
as
a
result
of
irritating
nervous
tissue
,
is
just
as

unaccountable
as
the
appearance
of
the
djin
,
when
aladdin
rubbed
his

lamp
(1866
)
.



the
early
twentieth
century
saw
the
eclipse
of
consciousness
from
scientific
psychology
,
especially
in
the
united
states
with
the
rise
of
behaviorism
(watson
1924
,
skinner
1953
)
though
movements

as
gestalt

(neisser
1965
,
gardiner
1985
)
.


however
,
despite
the
renewed
emphasis
on
explaining
cognitive
capacities
such
as
memory
,
perception
and
language
comprehension
,
consciousness
remained
a
largely
neglected
topic
for
several
further
decades
.



in
the
1980s
and
90s
there
was
a
major
resurgence
of
scientific
and
philosophical
research
into
the
nature
and
basis
of
consciousness
(baars
1988
,
dennett
1991
,
penrose
1989
,
1994
,
crick
1994
,
lycan
1987
,
1996
,
chalmers
1996
)
.


once
consciousness
was
back
under
discussion
,
there
was
a
rapid
proliferation
of
research
with
a
flood
of
books
and
articles
,
as
well
as
the
introduction
of
specialty
journals
(the
journal
of
consciousness
studies
,
consciousness
and
cognition
,
psyche
)
,
professional
societies
(association
for
the
scientific
study
of
consciousness—assc
)
and
annual
conferences
devoted
exclusively
to
its
investigation
(“the
science
of
consciousness”
)
.

concepts
of
consciousness

the
words
“conscious”
and
“consciousness”
are
umbrella
terms
that
cover
a
wide
variety
of
mental
phenomena
.


both
are
used
with
a
diversity
of
meanings
,
and
the
adjective
“conscious”
is
heterogeneous
in
its
range
,
being
applied
both
to
whole
organisms—creature
consciousness—and
to
particular
mental
states
and
processes—state
consciousness
(rosenthal
1986
,
gennaro
1995
,
carruthers
2000
)
.

creature
consciousness

an
animal
,
person
or
other
cognitive
system
may
be
regarded
as
conscious
---------------
hypnotized
or
in
a
fugue
state
?



self-consciousness
.


a
third
and
yet
more
demanding
sense
might
define
conscious
creatures
as
those
that
are
not
only
aware
but
also
aware
that
they
are
aware
,
thus
treating
creature
consciousness
as
a
form
of
self-consciousness
(carruthers
2000
)
.


the
self-awareness
requirement
might
get
interpreted
in
a
variety
of
ways
,
and
which
creatures
would
qualify
as
conscious
in
the
relevant
sense
will
vary
accordingly
.


if

---------------
world
through
its
echo-locatory
senses
,
even
though
we
humans
from
our
human
point
of
view
can
not
emphatically
understand
what
such
a
mode
of
consciousness
is
like
from
the
bat
'
s
own
point
of
view
.



subject
of
conscious
states
.


a
fifth
alternative
would
be
to
define
the
---------------
upon
the
particular
account
one
gives
of
conscious
states
(section
2
.

2
)
.



transitive
consciousness
.


in
addition
to
describing
creatures
as
conscious
in
these
various
senses
,
there
are
also
related
senses
in
which
creatures
are
described
as
being
conscious
of
various
things
.


the
distinction
is
sometimes
marked
as
that
between
transitive
and
intransitive
notions
of
consciousness
,
with
the
former
involving
some
object
at
which
consciousness
is
directed
(rosenthal
1986
)
.

state
consciousness

the
notion
of
a
conscious
mental
state
also
has
a
variety
of
distinct
---------------

phenomenal
states
.


such
qualia
are
sometimes
referred
to
as
phenomenal
properties
and
the
associated
sort
of
consciousness
as
phenomenal
consciousness
,
but
the
latter
term
is
perhaps
more
properly
applied
to
the
overall
structure
of
experience
and
involves
far
more
than
sensory
qualia
.


the
phenomenal
structure
of
consciousness
also
encompasses
much
of
the
spatial
,
temporal
and
conceptual
organization
of
our
experience
of
the
world
and
of
ourselves
as
agents
in
it
(see
section
4
.

3
)
.


it
is
therefore
probably
best
,
at
least
initially
,
to
distinguish
the
concept
of
phenomenal
consciousness
from
that
of
qualitative
consciousness
,
though
they
no
doubt
overlap
.



what-it-is-like
states
.


consciousness
in
both
those
senses
links
up
as
well
with
thomas
nagel
'
s
(1974
)
notion
of
a
conscious
creature
,
insofar
as
one
might
count
a
mental
state
as
conscious
in
the
“what
it
is
like”
---------------
or
qualitative
state
.



access
consciousness
.


states
might
be
conscious
in
a
seemingly
quite
different
access
sense
,
which
has
more
to
do
with
intra-mental
relations
.


in
this
respect
,
a
state
'
s
being
conscious
is
a
matter
of

of

this
more
functional
sense
,
which
corresponds
to
what
ned
block
(1995
)
calls
access
consciousness
,
a
visual
state
'

being

is
not
so
much
a
matter

whether

it

the

narrative
consciousness

states
might
also
be
regarded
as
conscious
in
a
narrative
sense
that
appeals
to
the
notion
of
the
“stream
of
consciousness”
,
regarded
as
an
ongoing
more
or
less
serial
narrative
of
episodes
from
the
perspective
of
an
actual
or
merely
virtual
self

the
idea
would

to
equate
the

states

independently
specified
,
they
are
obviously
not
without
potential
links
,
nor
do
they
exhaust
the
realm
of
possible
options
.


drawing
connections
,
one
might
argue
that
states
appear
in
the
stream
of
consciousness
only
in
so
far
as
we
are
aware
of
them
,
and
thus
forge
a
bond
between
the
first
meta-mental
notion
of
a
conscious
state
and
the
stream
or
---------------
conscious
mental
states

consciousness
as
an
entity

the
noun
“consciousness”
has
an
equally
diverse
range
of
meanings
that
largely
parallel
those
of
the
adjective
“conscious”
.


distinctions
can
be
drawn
between
creature
and
state
consciousness
as
well
as
among
the
varieties
of
each
.


one
can
refer
specifically
to
phenomenal
consciousness
,
access
consciousness
,
reflexive
or
meta-mental
consciousness
,
and
narrative
consciousness
among
other
varieties
.



here
consciousness
itself
is
not
typically
treated
as
a
substantive
entity
but
merely
the
abstract
reification
of
whatever
property
or
aspect
is
attributed
by
the
relevant
use
of
the
adjective
“conscious”
.


access
consciousness
is
just
the
property
of
having
the
required
sort
of
internal
access
relations
,
and
qualitative
consciousness
is
simply
the
property
that
is
attributed
when
“conscious”
is
applied
in
the
qualitative
sense
to
mental
states
.


how
much
this
commits
one
to
the
ontological
status
of
consciousness
per
se
will
depend
on
how
much
of
a
platonist
one
is
about
universals
in
general
.


(see
the
entry
on
the
medieval
problem
of
universals
.


)
it
need
not
commit
one
to
consciousness
as
a
distinct
entity
any
more
than
one
'
s
use
of
“square”
,
“red”
or
“gentle”
commits
one
to
the
existence
of
squareness
,
redness
or
---------------

though
it
is
not
the
norm
,
one
could
nonetheless
take
a
more
robustly
realist
view
of
consciousness
as
a
component
of
reality
.


that
is
one
could
think
of
consciousness
as
more
on
a
par
with
electromagnetic
fields
than
with
life
.



---------------
relations
among
particles
.



similarly
one
could
regard
“consciousness”
as
referring
to
a
component
or
aspect
of
reality
that
manifests
itself
in
conscious
states
and
creatures
but
is
more
than
merely
the
abstract
nominalization
of
the
---------------
logical
space
of
options
.



there
are
thus
many
concepts
of
consciousness
,
and
both
“conscious”
and
“consciousness”
are
used
in
a
wide
range
of
ways
with
no
privileged
or
canonical
meaning
.


however
,
this
may
be
less
of
an
embarrassment
than
an
embarrassment
of
riches
.


consciousness
is
a
complex
feature
of
the
world
,
and
understanding
it
will
require
a
diversity
of
conceptual
tools
for
dealing
with
its
many
differing
aspects
.


conceptual
plurality
is
thus
just
what
one
would
hope
for
.


as
long
as
one
avoids
confusion
by
being
clear
about
one
'
s
meanings
,
there
is
great
value
in
having
a
variety
of
concepts
by
which
we
can
access
and
grasp
consciousness
in
all
its
rich
complexity
.


however
,
one
should
not
assume
that
conceptual
plurality
implies
referential
divergence
.


our
multiple
concepts
of
consciousness
may
in
fact
pick
out
varying
aspects
of
a
single
unified
underlying
mental
phenomenon
.


whether
and
to
what
extent
they
do
so
remains
an
open
question
.

problems
of
consciousness

the
task
of
understanding
consciousness
is
an
equally
diverse
project
.


not
only
do
many
different
aspects
of
mind
count
as
conscious
in
some
sense
,
each
is
also
open
to
various
respects
in
which
it
might
be
explained
or
modeled
.


understanding
consciousness
involves
a
multiplicity
not
only
of
explananda
but
also
of
questions
that
they
pose
and
the
sorts
of
answers
they
require
.


at
the
risk
of
oversimplifying
,
---------------
what
,
how
,
and
why
questions
:

-
the
descriptive
question
:
what
is
consciousness
?


what
are
its

principal
features
?


and
by
what
means
can
they
be
best
discovered
,

described
and
modeled
?


-
the
explanatory
question
:
how
does
consciousness
of
the
relevant

sort
come
to
exist
?


is
it
a
primitive
aspect
of
reality
,
and
if
not

how
does
(or
could
)
consciousness
in
the
relevant
respect
arise
from

or
be
caused
by
nonconscious
entities
or
processes
?


-
the
functional
question
:
why
does
consciousness
of
the
relevant
sort

exist
?


does
it
have
a
function
,
and
if
so
what
is
it
?


does
it
act

causally
and
if
so
with
what
sorts
of
effects
?


does
it
make
a
---------------

the
three
questions
focus
respectively
on
describing
the
features
of
consciousness
,
explaining
its
underlying
basis
or
cause
,
and
explicating
its
role
or
value
.


the
divisions
among
the
three
are
of
course
somewhat
artificial
,
and
in
practice
the
answers
one
gives
to
each
will
depend
in
part
on
what
one
says
about
the
others
.


one
can
not
,
for
example
,
adequately
answer
the
what
question
and
describe
the
main
features
of
consciousness
without
addressing
the
why
issue
of
its
functional
role
within
systems
whose
operations
it
affects
.


nor
could
one
explain
how
the
relevant
sort
of
consciousness
might
arise
from
nonconscious
processes
unless
one
had
a
clear
account
of
just
what
features
had
to
be
caused
or
realized
to
count
as
producing
it
.


those
caveats
---------------
structure
for
articulating
the
overall
explanatory
project
and
for
assessing
the
adequacy
of
particular
theories
or
models
of
consciousness
.

.


the
descriptive
question
:
what
are
the
features
of
consciousness
?



the
what
question
asks
us
to
describe
and
model
the
principal
features
of
consciousness
,
but
just
which
features
are
relevant
will
vary
with
the
sort
of
consciousness
we
aim
to
capture
.


the
main
properties
of
access
consciousness
may
be
quite
unlike
those
of
qualitative
or
phenomenal
consciousness
,
and
those
of
reflexive
consciousness
or
narrative
consciousness
may
differ
from
both
.


however
,
by
building
up
detailed
theories
of
each
type
,
we
may
hope
to
find
important
links
between
them
and
perhaps
even
to
discover
that
they
coincide
in
at
least
---------------
the
general
descriptive
project
will
require
a
variety
of
investigational
methods
(flanagan
1992
)
.


though
one
might
naively
regard
the
facts
of
consciousness
as
too
self-evident
to
require
any
systematic
methods
of
gathering
data
,
the
epistemic
task
is
in
reality
far
from
trivial
(husserl
1913
)
.


---------------
the
need
for
third-person
empirical
data
gathered
by
external
observers
is
perhaps
most
obvious
with
regard
to
the
more
clearly
functional
types
of
consciousness
such
as
access
consciousness
,
but
it
is
required
even
with
regard
to
phenomenal
and
qualitative
consciousness
.


for
example
,
deficit
studies
that
correlate
various
neural
and
functional
sites
of
damage
with
abnormalities
of
conscious
experience
can
make
us
aware
of
---------------
introspection
(libet
1985
,
wegner
2002
)
.


nor
are
the
facts
gathered
by
these
third
person
methods
merely
about
the
causes
or
bases
of
consciousness
;
they
often
concern
the
very
structure
of
phenomenal
consciousness
itself
.


first-person
,
third-person
and
perhaps
even
second-person
(varela
1995
)
interactive
methods
will
all
be
needed
to
collect
the
requisite
evidence
.



using
all
these
sources
of
data
,
we
will
hopefully
be
able
to
construct
detailed
descriptive
models
of
the
various
sorts
of
consciousness
.


though
the
specific
features
of
most
importance
may
vary
among
the
different
types
,
our
overall
descriptive
project
will
need
to
address
at
least
the
following
seven
general
aspects
of
consciousness
(sections
4
.

2–4
.

)
.



---------------
responds
in
apt
ways
to
its
world
but
lacks
such
qualia
,
then
it
might
count
as
conscious
at
best
in
a
loose
and
less
than
literal
sense
.


or
so
at
least
it
would
seem
to
those
who
take
qualitative
consciousness
in
the
“what
it
is
like”
sense
to
be
philosophically
and
scientifically
central
(nagel
1974
,
chalmers
1996
)
.


---------------
structure
as
involving
a
special
kind
of
intentional
and
representational
organization
and
content
,
the
kind
distinctively
associated
with
consciousness
(siewert
1998
)
.


(see
the
entry
on
representational
theories
of
consciousness
.


)

answering
the
what
question
requires
a
careful
account
of
the
coherent
---------------

subjectivity
is
another
notion
sometimes
equated
with
the
qualitative
or
the
phenomenal
aspects
of
consciousness
in
the
literature
,
but
again
there
are
good
reason
to
recognize
it
,
at
least
in
some
of
its
forms
,
as
a
distinct
feature
of
consciousness—related
to
the
qualitative
and
the
phenomenal
but
different
from
each
.


in
particular
,
the
epistemic
form
of
subjectivity
concerns
apparent
limits
on
the
knowability
or
even
the
---------------
whether
facts
about
experience
are
indeed
epistemically
limited
in
this
way
is
open
to
debate
(lycan
1996
)
,
but
the
claim
that
understanding
consciousness
requires
special
forms
of
knowing
and
access
from
the
inside
point
of
view
is
intuitively
plausible
and
has
a
long
history

(locke
1688
)
.


thus
any
adequate
answer
to
the
what
question
must
address
the
epistemic
status
of
consciousness
,
both
our
abilities
to
understand
it
and
their
limits
(papineau
2002
,
chalmers
2003
)

self-perspectival
organization

the
perspectival
structure
of
consciousness
is
one
aspect
of
its
overall
phenomenal
organization
,
but
it
is
important
enough
to
merit
discussion
in
its
own
right
.


insofar
as
the
key
perspective
is
that
of
the
---------------
constitute
a
unified
and
coherent
self
,
and
they
likely
differ
accordingly
in
the
sort
or
degree
of
perspectival
focus
they
embody
in
their
respective
forms
of
experience
(lorenz
1977
)
.


consciousness
may
not
require
a
distinct
or
substantial
self
of
the
traditional
cartesian
sort
,
but
at
least
some
degree
of
perspectivally
self-like
organization
---------------
unity
is
closely
linked
with
the
self-perspective
,
but
it
merits
specific
mention
on
its
own
as
a
key
aspect
of
the
organization
of
consciousness
.


conscious
systems
and
conscious
mental
states
both
involve
many
diverse
forms
of
unity
.


some
are
causal
unities
associated
with
the
integration
of
action
and
control
into
a
unified
focus
of
---------------
experience
can
have
the
content
that
it
does
only
because
it
resides
within
that
larger
unified
structure
of
representation
.


(see
the
entry
on
unity
of
consciousness

)

particular
attention
has
been
paid
recently
to
the
notion
of
phenomenal
---------------
and
dispositions
to
have
conscious
states
can
be
genuinely
intentional
,
but
most
theorists
regard
intentionality
as
extending
widely
into
the
unconscious
domain
.


(see
the
entry
on
consciousness
and
intentionality

)

one
potentially
important
dimension
of
difference
concerns
so
called
transparency
,
which
is
an
important
feature
of
consciousness
in
two
interrelated
metaphoric
senses
,
each
of
which
has
an
intentional
,
an
experiential
and
a
functional
aspect
.


---------------
green

of
my
visual
experience

(see
the
entry

)
moore
himself
believed
we
could
become
aware
of
those
latter
qualities
with
effort
and
redirection
of
attention
,
though
some
contemporary
transparency
advocates
deny
it

tye

kind
---------------
to
‘think
right
through’
them
to
what
they
mean
or
represent
.


transparency
in
this
semantic
sense
may
correspond
at
least
partly
with
what
john
searle
calls
the
“intrinsic
intentionality”
of
consciousness

(searle
1992
)
.



---------------
to
accommodate
the
former
notion
within
a
more
externalist
account
of
content
and
meaning
.


both
semantic
and
sensory
transparency
obviously
concern
the
representational
or
intentional
aspects
of
consciousness
,
but
they
are
also
experiential
aspects
of
our
conscious
life
.


they
are
part
of
what
it
'
s
like
or
how
it
feels
phenomenally
to
be
conscious
.

dynamic
flow

the
dynamics
of
consciousness
are
evident
in
the
coherent
order
of
its
ever
changing
process
of
flow
and
self-transformation
,
what
william
james
(1890
)
called
the
“stream
of
consciousness
.

”
some
temporal
sequences
of
experience
are
generated
by
purely
internal
factors
as
when
one
thinks
through
a
puzzle
,
and
others
depend
in
part
upon
external
causes
as
when
one
chases
a
fly
ball
,
but
even
the
latter
sequences
are
shaped
in
large
part
by
how
consciousness
transforms
itself
.



whether
partly
in
response
to
outer
influences
or
entirely
from
within
,
---------------
those
that
preceded
it
,
constrained
and
enabled
by
the
global
structure
of
links
and
limits
embodied
in
its
underlying
prior
organization

(husserl
1913
)
.


in
that
respect
,
consciousness
is
an
autopoietic
system
,
i
.

e
.


,
a
self-creating
and
self-organizing
system
(varela
and
maturana
1980
)
.


---------------
intentional
properties
and
interconnected
contents
(van
gulick
2000
)
.



consciousness
is
a
dynamic
process
,
and
thus
an
adequate
descriptive
answer
to
the
what
question
must
deal
with
more
than
just
its
static
or
momentary
properties
.


in
particular
,
it
must
give
some
account
of
the
temporal
dynamics
of
consciousness
and
the
ways
in
which
its
self-transforming
flow
reflects
both
its
intentional
coherence
and
the
semantic
self-understanding
embodied
in
the
organized
controls
through
---------------
systems
engaged
with
their
worlds
.



a
comprehensive
descriptive
account
of
consciousness
would
need
to
deal
with
more
than
just
these
seven
features
,
but
having
a
clear
account
of
each
of
them
would
take
us
a
long
way
toward
answering
the
“what
is
consciousness
?

”
question
.

.


the
explanatory
question
:
how
can
consciousness
exist
?



the
how
question
focuses
on
explanation
rather
than
description
.


it
asks
us
to
explain
the
basic
status
of
consciousness
and
its
place
in
nature
.


is
it
a
fundamental
feature
of
reality
in
its
own
right
,
or
does
its
existence
depend
upon
other
nonconscious
items
,
be
they
physical
,
biological
,
neural
or
computational
?


and
if
the
latter
,
can
we
explain
or
understand
how
the
relevant
nonconscious
items
could
cause
or
realize
consciousness
?


put
simply
,
can
we
explain
how
to
make
something
conscious
out
of
things
that
are
not
conscious
?



---------------
the
how
question
is
not
a
single
question
,
but
rather
a
general
family
of
more
specific
questions
(van
gulick
1995
)
.


they
all
concern
the
possibility
of
explaining
some
sort
or
aspect
of
consciousness
,
but
they
vary
in
their
particular
explananda
,
the
restrictions
on
their
explanans
,
and
their
criteria
for
successful
explanation
.


for
example
,
one
might
ask
whether
we
can
explain
access
consciousness
computationally
by
mimicking
the
requisite
access
relations
in
a
computational
model
.


or
one
might
be
concerned
instead
with
whether
the
---------------

explananda
.


possible
explananda
would
include
the
various
sorts
of
state
and
creature
consciousness
distinguished
above
,
as
well
as
the
seven
features
of
consciousness
listed
in
response
to
the
what
question
.


those
two
types
of
explananda
overlap
and
intersect
.


we
might
for
example
aim
to
explain
the
dynamic
aspect
either
of
phenomenal
or
of
access
consciousness
.


or
we
could
try
to
explain
the
subjectivity
of
either

all
apply
to

how
one
explains
a

feature
in

to

sort
of

explanans
.


the
range
of
possible
explanans
is
also
diverse
.


in
perhaps
its
broadest
form
,
the
how
question
asks
how
consciousness
of
the
relevant
sort
could
be
caused
or
realized
by
nonconscious
items
,
but
we
can
generate
a
wealth
of
more
specific
questions
by
further
restricting
the
range
of
the
relevant
explanans
.


one
might
seek
to
explain
how
a
given
feature
of
consciousness
is
caused
or
realized
by
underlying
neural
processes
,
biological
structures
,
physical
mechanisms
,
functional
or
teleofunctional
relations
,
computational
organization
,
or
even
by
---------------
vary
accordingly
.


in
general
the
more
limited
and
elementary
the
range
of
the
explanans
,
the
more
difficult
the
problem
of
explaining
how
could
it
suffice
to
produce
consciousness
(van
gulick
1995
)
.



criteria
of
explanation
.


the
third
key
parameter
is
how
one
defines
the
---------------
explanandum
be
a
priori
deducible
from
the
explanans
,
although
it
is
controversial
whether
this
is
either
a
necessary
or
a
sufficient
criterion
for
explaining
consciousness
(jackson
1993
)
.


its
sufficiency
will
depend
in
part
on
the
nature
of
the
premises
from
which
the
deduction
proceeds
.


as
a
matter
of
logic
,
one
will
need
some
bridge
principles
to
connect
propositions
or
sentences
about
consciousness
with
those
that
do
not
mention
it
.


if
one
'
s
premises
concern
physical
or
neural
facts
,
then
one
will
need
some
bridge
principles
or
links
that
connect
such
facts
with
facts
about
consciousness
(kim
1998
)
.


brute
links
,
whether
nomic
or
merely
well
confirmed
correlations
,
could
provide
a
logically
sufficient
bridge
to
infer
conclusions
about
consciousness
.


but
they
would
probably
not
allow
us
to
see
how
or
why
those
connections
hold
,
and
thus
they
would
fall
short
of
fully
explaining
how
consciousness
exists
(levine
1983
,
1993
,
mcginn
1991
)
.



one
could
legitimately
ask
for
more
,
in
particular
for
some
account
that
---------------
satisfy
the
conditions
for
the
liquidity
of
the
water
they
compose
.


moreover
,
the
model
makes
intelligible
how
the
liquidity
is
produced
by
the
micro-properties
.


a
satisfactory
explanation
of
how
consciousness
is
produced
might
seem
to
require
a
similar
two
stage
story
.


without
it
,
even
a
priori
deducibility
might
seem
explanatorily
less
than
---------------
sometimes
described
,
following
joseph
levine
(1983
)
,
as
the
existence
of
an
explanatory
gap
,
and
as
indicating
our
incomplete
understanding
of
how
consciousness
might
depend
upon
a
nonconscious
substrate
,
especially
a
physical
substrate
.


the
basic
gap
claim
admits
of
many
variations
in
generality
and
thus
in
strength
.


---------------

if
one
could
see
on
a
priori
grounds
that
there
is
no
way
in
which
consciousness
could
be
intelligibly
explained
as
arising
from
the
physical
,
it
would
not
be
a
big
step
to
concluding
that
it
in
fact
does
not
do
so
(chalmers
1996
)
.


however
,
the
very
strength
of
such
an
---------------
support
,
such
as
the
alleged
conceivability
of
zombies
molecularly
identical
with
conscious
humans
but
devoid
of
all
phenomenal
consciousness
(campbell
1970
,
kirk
1974
,
chalmers
1996
)
.


other
supporting
arguments
invoke
the
supposed
non-functional
nature
of
consciousness
and
thus
its
alleged
resistance
to
the
standard
scientific
method
of
explaining
complex
properties
(e

,
genetic
dominance
)
in
terms
of
physically
realized
functional
conditions
(block
1980a
,
---------------
properties
and
relations
might
be
underlain
by
physical
ones
.


thus
one
might
opt
for
a
similar
criterion
for
interpreting
the
how
question
and
for
what
counts
as
explaining
how
consciousness
might
be
caused
or
realized
by
nonconscious
items
.


however
,
some
critics
,
such
as
kim

)
,
have
challenged
the
coherence
of
any
view
that
aims
to
be
both
---------------

in
turn
(van
gulick
1993
)
.



others
have
argued
that
consciousness
is
especially
resistant
to
explanation
in
physical
terms
because
of
the
inherent
differences
between
our
subjective
and
objective
modes
of
understanding
.


thomas
---------------

the
how
question
thus
subdivides
into
a
diverse
family
of
more
specific
questions
depending
upon
the
specific
sort
or
feature
of
consciousness
one
aims
to
explain
,
the
specific
restrictions
one
places
on
the
range
of
the
explanans
and
the
criterion
one
uses
to
define
explanatory
success
.


some
of
the
resulting
variants
seem
easier
to
answer
than
others
.


progress
may
seem
likely
on
some
of
the
so
called
“easy
problems”
of
consciousness
,
such
as
explaining
the
dynamics
of
access
consciousness
in
terms
of
the
functional
or
computational
organization
of
the
brain
(baars
1988
)
.


others
may
seem
less
tractable
,
especially
the
so-called
“hard
problem”
(chalmers
1995
)
which
is
more
or
less
that
of
giving
an
intelligible
account
that
lets
us
see
in
an
intuitively
satisfying
way
how
phenomenal
or
“what
it

like”
consciousness
might
arise
from
physical
or
neural
processes
in
the
brain

---------------
hand
,
but
others
appear
to
remain
deeply
baffling
.


nor
should
we
assume
that
every
version
has
a
positive
answer
.


if
dualism
is
true
,
then
consciousness
in
at
least
some
of
its
types
may
be
basic
and
fundamental
.


if
so
,we
will
not
be
able
to
explain
how
it
arises
from
nonconscious
items
since
it
simply
does
not
do
so
.



one
'
s
view
of
the
prospects
for
explaining
consciousness
will
typically
depend
upon
one
'
s
perspective
.


optimistic
physicalists
will
likely
see
current
explanatory
lapses
as
merely
the
reflection
of
the
early
stage
---------------

(dennett
1991
,
searle
1992
,
p
.


m
.

churchland
1995
)
.


to
dualists
,
those
same
impasses
will
signify
the
bankruptcy
of
the
physicalist
program
and
the
need
to
recognize
consciousness
as
a
fundamental
constituent
of
reality
in
its
own
right
(robinson
1982
,
foster
1989
,
1996
,
chalmers
1996
)
.


what
one
sees
depends
in
part
on
where
one
stands
,
and
the
ongoing
project
of
explaining
consciousness
will
be
accompanied
by
continuing
debate
about
its
status
and
prospects
for
success
.

the
functional
question
:
why
does
consciousness
exist
?



the
functional
or
why
question
asks
about
the
value
or
role
or
consciousness
and
thus
indirectly
about
its
origin
.


does
it
have
a
function
,
and
if
so
what
is
it
?


does
it
make
a
difference
to
the
operation
of
systems
in
which
it
is
present
,
and
if
so
why
and
how
?


if
consciousness
exists
as
a
complex
feature
of
biological
systems
,
then
its
adaptive
value
is
likely
relevant
to
explaining
its
evolutionary
origin
,
though
of
course
its
present
function
,
if
it
has
one
,
need
not
be
the
same
as
that
it
may
have
had
when
it
first
arose
.


adaptive
functions
often
change
over
biological
time
.


questions
about
the
value
of
consciousness
also
have
a
moral
dimension
in
at
least
two
ways
.


we
are
inclined
to
regard
an
organism
'
s
moral
status
as
at
least
partly
determined
by
the
nature
and
extent
to
which
it
is
conscious
,
and
---------------
as
with
the
what
and
how
questions
,
the
why
question
poses
a
general
problem
that
subdivides
into
a
diversity
of
more
specific
inquiries
.


in
so
far
as
the
various
sorts
of
consciousness
,
e
.

g
.


,
access
,
phenomenal
,
meta-mental
,
are
distinct
and
separable—which
remains
an
open
question—they
likely
also
differ
in
their
specific
roles
and
values
.


thus
the
why
question
may
well
not
have
a
single
or
uniform
answer
.

causal
status
of
consciousness

perhaps
the
most
basic
issue
posed
by
any
version
of
the
why
question
is
whether
or
not
consciousness
of
the
relevant
sort
has
any
causal
impact
at
all
.


if
it
has
no
effects
and
makes
no
causal
difference
whatsoever
,
then
it
would
seem
unable
to
play
any
significant
role
in
the
systems
or
---------------
inquiries
about
its
possible
value
.


nor
can
the
threat
of
epiphenomenal
irrelevance
be
simply
dismissed
as
an
obvious
non-option
,
since
at
least
some
forms
of
consciousness
have
been
seriously
alleged
in
the
recent
literature
to
lack
causal
status
.


(see
the
entry
on
epiphenomenalism
.


)
such
worries
have
been
raised
especially
with
regard
to
qualia
and
qualitative
consciousness
(huxley
1874
,
jackson
1982
,
chalmers
1996
)
,
but
challenges
have
also
been
leveled
against
the
causal
status
of
other
sorts
including
meta-mental
consciousness
(velmans
1991
)
.



both
metaphysical
and
empirical
arguments
have
been
given
in
support
of
---------------
whose
behavior
,
functional
organization
,
and
physical
structure
down
to
the
molecular
level
are
identical
to
those
of
normal
human
agents
but
who
lack
any
qualia
or
qualitative
consciousness
.


some
(kirk
1970
,
chalmers
1996
)
assert
such
beings
are
possible
in
worlds
that
share
all
our
physical
laws
,
but
others
deny
it
(dennett
1991
,
levine
2001
)
.


if
---------------

arguments
of
a
far
more
empirical
sort
have
challenged
the
causal
status
of
meta-mental
consciousness
,
at
least
in
so
far
as
its
presence
can
be
measured
by
the
ability
to
report
on
one
'
s
mental
state
.


scientific
evidence
is
claimed
to
show
that
consciousness
of
that
sort
is
neither
necessary
for
any
type
of
mental
ability
nor
does
it
occur
early
enough
to
act
as
a
cause
of
the
acts
or
processes
typically
thought
to
be
its
effects
(velmans
1991
)
.


according
to
those
who
make
such
arguments
,
the
sorts
of
mental
abilities
that
are
typically
thought
to
require
consciousness
can
all
be
realized
unconsciously
in
the
absence
of
the
supposedly
required
self-awareness
.



---------------
occurs
too
late
to
be
the
cause
of
the
relevant
actions
rather
than
their
result
or
at
best
a
joint
effect
of
some
shared
prior
cause
(libet
1985
)
.


self-awareness
or
meta-mental
consciousness
according
to
these
arguments
turns
out
to
be
a
psychological
after-effect
rather
than
an
initiating
cause
,
more
like
a
post
facto
printout
or
the
result
---------------
flanagan
1992
,
and
commentaries
accompanying
velmans
1991
)
.


though
the
empirical
arguments
,
like
the
zombie
claims
,
require
one
to
consider
seriously
whether
some
forms
of
consciousness
may
be
less
causally
potent
than
is
typically
assumed
,
many
theorists
regard
the
empirical
data
as
no
real
threat
to
the
causal
status
of
consciousness
.



if
the
epiphenomenalists
are
wrong
and
consciousness
,
in
its
various
forms
,
is
indeed
causal
,
what
sorts
of
effects
does
it
have
and
what
differences
does
it
make
?


how
do
mental
processes
that
involve
the
relevant
sort
of
consciousness
differ
form
those
that
lack
it
?


what
function
(s
)
might
consciousness
play
?


the
following
six
sections

(6
.

2–6
.

7
)
discuss
some
of
the
more
commonly
given
answers
.


though
the
various
functions
overlap
to
some
degree
,
each
is
distinct
,
and
they
differ
as
well
in
the
sorts
of
consciousness
with
which
each
is
most
aptly
linked
.



---------------
automatic
unconscious
mental
operations
(anderson
1983
)
.


the
relevant
increases
in
flexibility
would
seem
most
closely
connected
with
the
meta-mental
or
higher-order
form
of
consciousness
in
so
far
as
the
enhanced
ability
to
control
processes
depends
upon
greater
self-awareness
.


however
,
flexibility
and
sophisticated
modes
of
control
may
be
associated
as
well
with
the
phenomenal
and
access
forms
of
consciousness
.

social
coordination

enhanced
capacity
for
social
coordination
.


consciousness
of
the
meta-mental
sort
may
well
involve
not
only
an
increase
in
self-awareness
but
also
an
enhanced
understanding
of
the
mental
states
of
other
minded
---------------
this
increase
in
mutually
shared
knowledge
of
each
other
'
s
minds
,
enables
the
relevant
organisms
to
interact
,
cooperate
and
communicate
in
more
advanced
and
adaptive
ways
.


although
meta-mental
consciousness
is
the
sort
most
obviously
linked
to
such
a
socially
coordinative
role
,
narrative
consciousness
of
the
kind
associated
with
the
stream
of
consciousness
is
also
clearly
relevant
in
so
far
as
it
involves
the
application
to
one
'
s
own
case
of
the
interpretative
abilities
that
derive
in
part
from
their
social
application
(ryle
1949
,
dennett

,
---------------
conscious
experience
.


the
unity
of
experienced
space
is
just
one
example
of
the
sort
of
integration
associated
with
our
conscious
awareness
of
an
objective
world
.


(see
the
entry
on
unity
of
consciousness
.


)

this
integrative
role
or
value
is
most
directly
associated
with
access
consciousness
,
but
also
clearly
with
the
larger
phenomenal
and
intentional
structure
of
experience
.


it
is
relevant
even
to
the
qualitative
aspect
of
consciousness
in
so
far
as
qualia
play
an
important
role
in
our
experience
of
unified
objects
in
a
unified
space
or
scene
.


it
is
intimately
tied
as
well
to
the
transparency
of

semantic
transparency
(van

.


integration
of

plays
a
major
role

)
and

.



---------------

this
particular
role
is
most
directly
and
definitionally
tied
to
the
notion
of
access
consciousness
(block

)
,
but
meta-mental
consciousness
as
well
as
the
phenomenal
and
qualitative
forms
all
seem
plausibly
linked
to
such
increases
in
the
availability
of
information

(armstrong

(see
the
entry
on
free
will
.


)
the
notion
of
free
will
may
itself
remain
too
murky
and
contentious
to
shed
any
clear
light
on
the
role
of
consciousness
,
but
there
is
a
traditional
intuition
that
the
two
are
deeply
linked
.



consciousness
has
been
thought
to
open
a
realm
of
possibilities
,
a
sphere
of
options
within
which
the
conscious
self
might
choose
or
act
freely
.


at
a
minimum
,
consciousness
might
seem
a
necessary
precondition
for
any
such
freedom
or
self-determination
(hasker
1999
)
.


how
could
one
engage
in
the
requisite
sort
of
free
choice
,
while
remaining
solely
---------------
own
nature
and
future
development
may
admit
of
many
interesting
variations
and
degrees
rather
than
being
a
simple
all
or
nothing
matter
,
and
various
forms
or
levels
of
consciousness
might
be
correlated
with
corresponding
degrees
or
types
of
freedom
and
self-determination

(dennett
1984
,
2003
)
.


the
link
with
freedom
seems
strongest
for
the
meta-mental
form
of
consciousness
given
its
emphasis
on
self-awareness
,
but
potential
connections
also
seem
possible
for
most
of
the
other
sorts
as
well
.


---------------
appearance
of
intrinsic
and
directly
experienced
motivational
force
is
illusory
.


but
if
it
is
real
,
then
it
may
be
one
of
the
most
important
and
evolutionarily
oldest
respects
in
which
consciousness
makes
a
difference
to
the
mental
systems
and
processes
in
which
it
is
present

(humphreys
1992
)
.



other
suggestions
have
been
made
about
the
possible
roles
and
value
of
consciousness
,
and
these
six
surely
do
not
exhaust
the

sense
,
while
in
the
latter
case
consciousness

is
just
one
way
among
several
in
which
the
requisite
role
might
be

---------------
variety
of
subsystems
and
behavioral
applications
may
constitute
its
being
conscious

the
access
sense

by
contrast
,
even
if
the
qualitative
and
phenomenal
forms
of
consciousness
involve
a
highly
unified
and
densely
integrated
representation
of
objective
reality
,
it
may
be
possible
to
produce
representations
having
those

if
so
,
there
may
be
quite
other
means
of
achieving
a
comparable
result
without
qualitative

phenomenal
consciousness
.


whether
this
is
the
right
way
to
think
about
phenomenal
and
qualitative
conscious
is
unclear
;
perhaps
the
tie
to
unified
and
densely
integrated
representation
is
in
fact
as
intimate
and
constitutive
as
it
seems
to
be
in
the
case
of
access
consciousness

(carruthers

regardless
of
how
that
issue
gets
resolved
,
it
is
important
to
not
to
conflate
constitution
accounts
with
contingent
realization
accounts
when
addressing
the
function

consciousness

answering
the
question

theories

in

to
the
what

how
and

questions
many
theories
of

have
been
proposed
in
recent
years

however

not
all
theories
of

are
theories
of
the

they
vary
not
only
in
the
specific
sorts
of
consciousness
they
take
as
their
object
,
but
also
in
their
theoretical
aims

perhaps
the
largest
division
is
between
general
metaphysical
theories
that
aim
to
locate
consciousness

the
overall
ontological

mind-body
problem

“what
is
the
ontological
status
of
consciousness
relative

the
available
responses

parallel
the
standard

1
dualist
theories

dualist
theories
regard
at
least
some
aspects
of
consciousness
as
falling
outside
the
realm
of
the
physical
,but
specific
forms
of
dualism
differ
in
just
which
aspects
those
are

)

)
,
asserts
the
existence
of
both
physical
and
non-physical
substances
.


such
theories
entail
the
existence
of
non-physical
minds
or
selves
as
entities
in
which
consciousness
inheres
.


though
substance
dualism
is
at
present
largely
out
of
favor
,
it
does
have
some
contemporary
proponents
(swinburne
1986
,
foster
1989
,
1996
)
.


---------------
1996
)
according
to
which
the
proto-mental
aspects
of
micro-constituents
can
give
rise
under
suitable
conditions
of
combination
to
full
blown
consciousness
.


(see
the
entry
on
panpsychism
.


)

the
nature
of
the
relevant
proto-psychic
aspect
remains
unclear
,
and
---------------
properties
do
not
involve
any
such
feel
,
it
is
not
clear
how
they
are
any
better
able
than
physical
properties
to
account
for
qualitative
consciousness
in
solving
the
hard
problem
.



a
more
modest
form
of
panpsychism
has
been
advocated
by
the
neuroscientist
giulio
tononi
(2008
)
and
endorsed
by
other
neuroscientists
including
christof
koch
(2012
)
.


this
version
derives
from
tononi
'
s
integrated
information
theory
(iit
)
of
consciousness
that
identifies
consciousness
with
integrated
information
which
can
exist
in
many
degrees
(see
section
9
.

6
below
)
.


according
to
iit
,
even
a
simple
indicator
device
such
as
a
single
photo
diode
possesses
some
degree
of
integrated
information
and
thus
some
limited
degree
of
consciousness
,
a
consequence
which
both
tononi
and
koch
embrace
as
a
form
of
panpsychism
.



a
variety
of
arguments
have
been
given
in
favor
of
dualist
and
other
anti-physicalist
theories
of
consciousness
.


some
are
largelya
priori
in
nature
such
as
those
that
appeal
to
the
supposed
conceivability
of
zombies
(kirk
1970
,
chalmers
1996
)
or
versions
of
the
knowledge
argument

(jackson
1982
,
1986
)
which
aim
to
reach
an
anti-physicalist
conclusion
about
the
ontology
of
consciousness
from
the
apparent
limits
on
our
ability
to
fully
understand
the
qualitative
aspects
of
conscious
experience

third-person
physical
accounts

2
physicalist
theories

most
other
metaphysical
theories
of
consciousness
are
versions
of
physicalism
of
one
familiar
sort
or
another
.



eliminativist
theories
reductively
deny
the
existence
of
consciousness
or
at
least
the
existence
of
some
of
its
commonly
accepted
sorts
or
features
.


(see
the
entry
on
eliminative
materialism
.


)
the
radical
eliminativists
reject
the
very
notion
of
consciousness
as
muddled
or
wrong
headed
and
claim
that
the
conscious/nonconscious
distinction
fails
to
cut
mental
reality
at
its
joints
(wilkes
1984
,
1988
)
.


they
regard
the
idea
of
consciousness
as
sufficiently
off
target
to
merit
elimination
and
replacement
by
other
concepts
and
distinctions
more
reflective
of
the
true
nature
of
mind
(p

)
.


---------------
kinsbourne

)
.


more
modest
eliminativists
,
like
dennett
,
thus
typically
combine
their
qualified
denials
with
a
positive
theory
of
those
aspects
of
consciousness
they
take
as
real
,
such
as
the
multiple
drafts
model
(section
9
.

3
below
)
.



---------------
to
dissolve
the
explanatory
gap
problem
.



most
physicalist
theories
of
consciousness
are
neither
eliminativist
nor
based
on
strict
type-type
identities
.


they
acknowledge
the
reality
of
consciousness
but
aim
to
locate
it
within
the
physical
world
on
the
basis
of
some
psycho-physical
relation
short
of
strict
property
identity
.


---------------

functionalist
theories
in
particular
rely
heavily
on
the
notion
of
realization
to
explicate
the
relation
between
consciousness
and
the
physical
.


according
to
functionalism
,
a
state
or
process
counts
as
being
of
a
given
mental
or
conscious
type
in
virtue
of
the
functional
role
it
---------------
at
an
underlying
level
.



critics
of
functionalism
often
deny
that
consciousness
can
be
adequately
explicated
in
functional
terms
(block
1980a
,
1980b
,
levine
1983
,
chalmers
1996
)
.


according
to
such
critics
,
consciousness
may
have
interesting
functional
characteristics
but
its
nature
is
not
essentially
functional
.


such
claims
are
sometimes
supported
by
appeal
to
the
---------------
issue
remains
under
debate

specific
theories
of
consciousness

although
there
are
many
general
metaphysical/ontological
theories
of
consciousness
,
the
list
of
specific
detailed
theories
about
its
nature
is
even
longer
and
more
diverse
.


no
brief
survey
could
be
close
to
comprehensive
,
but
seven
main
types
of
theories
may
help
to
indicate
the
---------------
unconscious
consists
in
the
fact
that
we
are
not
reflexively
and
directly
aware
of
being
in
them
.


(see
the
entry
on
higher-order
theories
of
consciousness
.


)

higher-order
theories
come
in
two
main
variants
that
differ
concerning
---------------

the
higher-order
view
is
most
obviously
relevant
to
the
meta-mental
forms
of
consciousness
,
but
some
of
its
supporters
take
it
to
explain
other
types
of
consciousness
as
well
,
including
the
more
subjective
what
it
'
s
like
and
qualitative
types
.


one
common
strategy
is
to
analyze
qualia
as
mental
features
that
are
capable
of
occurring
unconsciously
;
---------------

(papineau
2002
)
.


whether
or
not
such
proposed
ho
accounts
of
qualia
are
successful
,
it
is
important
to
note
that
most
ho
advocates
take
themselves
to
be
offering
a
comprehensive
theory
of
consciousness
,
or
at
least
the
core
of
such
a
general
theory
,
rather
than
merely
one
limited
to
some
special
meta-mental
forms
of
it
.



other
variants
of
ho
theory
go
beyond
the
standard
hot
and
hop
versions
including
some
that
analyze
consciousness
in
terms
of
dispositional
rather
than
occurrent
higher-order
thoughts
(carruthers
2000
)
.


others
appeal
to
implicit
rather
than
explicit
higher-order
understanding
and
---------------

reflexive
theories
,
like
higher-order
theories
,
imply
a
strong
link
between
consciousness
and
self-awareness
.


they
differ
in
that
they
locate
the
aspect
of
self-awareness
directly
within
the
conscious
state
itself
rather
than
in
a
distinct
meta-state
directed
at
it
.


the
idea
---------------

(gennaro
2004
,
2012
)
while
others
reject
the
higher-order
category
and
describe
their
theories
as
presenting
a
“same-order”
account
of
consciousness
as
self-awareness
(kriegel
2009
)
.


yet
others
challenge
the
level
distinction
by
analyzing
the
meta-intentional
content
as
implicit
in
the
phenomenal
first-order
content
of
conscious
states
,
as
in
so

3
representationalist
theories

almost
all
theories
of
consciousness
regard
it
as
having
representational
features
,
but
so
called
representationalist
theories
are
defined
by
the
stronger
view
that
its
representational
features
---------------
obvious
targets
for
such
elimination
.


indeed
part
of
the
motivation
for
representationalism
is
to
show
that
one
can
accommodate
all
the
facts
about
consciousness
,
perhaps
within
a
physicalist
framework
,
without
needing
to
find
room
for
qualia
or
any
other
apparently
non-representational
mental
properties
(dennett
1990
,
lycan
1996

4
narrative
interpretative
theories

some
theories
of
consciousness
stress
the
interpretative
nature
of
facts
about
consciousness
.


according
to
such
views
,
what
is
or
is
not
conscious
is
not
always
a
determinate
fact
,
or
at
least
not
so
independent
of
a
larger
context
of
interpretative
judgments
.


the
most
prominent
philosophical
example
is
the
multiple
drafts
model
(mdm
)
of
consciousness
,
advanced
by
daniel
dennett
(1991
)
.


it
combines
elements
of
both
representationalism
and
higher-order
theory
but
does
so
in
a
way
that
varies
interestingly
from
the
more
standard
versions
of
either
providing
a
more
interpretational
and
less
strongly
realist
view
of
consciousness
.



the
mdm
includes
many
distinct
but
interrelated
features
.


its
name
---------------
“multiple”
of
the
multiple
drafts
model
.



the
mdm
is
representationalist
in
that
it
analyzes
consciousness
in
terms
of
content
relations
.


it
also
denies
the
existence
of
qualia
and
thus
rejects
any
attempt
to
distinguish
conscious
states
from
---------------
dennett
'
s
mdm
has
been
highly
influential
but
has
also
drawn
criticism
,
especially
from
those
who
find
it
insufficiently
realist
in
its
view
of
consciousness
and
at
best
incomplete
in
achieving
its
stated
goal
to
fully
explain
it
(block
1994
,
dretske
1994
,
levine

)
.


many
of
its
critics
acknowledge
the
insight
and
value
of
the
mdm
,
but
deny
that
there
are
no
real
facts
of
consciousness
other
than
those
captured
by

though
the
theory
is
not
intended
as

it
accords
a
major
role

5
cognitive
theories

a
number
theories
of
consciousness
associate
it
with
a
distinct
cognitive
architecture
or
with
a
special
pattern
of
activity
with
that
structure
.


---------------
global
workspace
.


a
major
psychological
example
of
the
cognitive
approach
is
the
global
workspace
theory
.


as
initially
developed
by
bernard
baars
(1988
)
)
global
workspace
theory
describes
consciousness
in
terms
of
a
competition
among
processors
and
outputs
for
a
limited
capacity
resource
that
“broadcasts”
information
for
widespread
access
---------------
the
model
has
been
further
developed
with
proposed
connections
to
particular
neural
and
functional
brain
systems
by
stanislas
dehaene
and
others
(2000
)
.


of
special
importance
is
the
claim
that
consciousness
in
both
the
access
and
phenomenal
sense
occurs
when
and
only
when
the
relevant
content
enters
the
larger
global
network
involving
both
primary
---------------

the
integration
of
information
from
many
sources
is
an
important
feature
of
consciousness
and
,
as
noted
above
(section
6
.

4
)
,
is
often
cited
as
one
of
its
major
functions
.


content
integration
plays
an
important
role
in
various
theories
especially
global
workspace
theory
(section
9
.

3
)
.


however
,
a
proposal
by
the
neuroscientist
giulio
tononi
(2008
)
goes
further
in
identifying
consciousness
with
integrated
information
and
asserting
that
information
integration
of
the
relevant
sort
is
both
necessary
and
sufficient
for
consciousness
regardless
of
the
substrate
in
which
it
is
realized
(which
need
not
be
neural
or
biological
)
.


according
to
tononi
'
s
integrated
information
theory
(iit
)
,
consciousness
is
a
purely
information-theoretic
property
of
systems
.


he
proposes
a
mathematical
measure
φ
that
aims
to
measure
not
merely
the
information
---------------
highest
φ
value
will
be
conscious
according
to
iit
.



according
to
iit
,
consciousness
varies
in
quantity
and
comes
in
many
degrees
which
correspond
to
φ
values
.


thus
even
a
simple
system
such
a
single
photo
diode
will
be
conscious
to
some
degree
if
it
is
not
contained
within
a
larger
complex
.


in
that
sense
,
iit
implies
a
form
of
panpsychism
that
tononi
explicitly
endorses
.


according
to
iit
,
the
quality
of
the
relevant
consciousness
is
determined
by
the
totality
of
informational
relations
within
the
relevant
integrated
complex
.


thus
iit
aims
to
explain
both
the
quantity
and
quality
of
phenomenal
consciousness
.


other
neuroscientists
,
notably
christof
koch
,
have
also
endorsed
the
iit
approach

neural
theories

neural
theories
of
consciousness
come
in
many
forms
,
though
most
in
some
way
concern
the
so
called
“neural
correlates
of
consciousness”
or
nccs
.


unless
one
is
a
dualist
or
other
non-physicalist
,
more
than
mere
correlation
is
required
;
at
least
some
nccs
must
be
the
essential
substrates
of
consciousness
.


an
explanatory
neural
theory
needs
to
explain
why
or
how
the
relevant
correlations
exist
,
and
if
the
theory
is
committed
to
physicalism
that
will
require
showing
how
the
underlying
---------------

such
theories
are
diverse
not
only
in
the
neural
processes
or
properties
to
which
they
appeal
but
also
in
the
aspects
of
consciousness
they
take
as
their
respective
explananda
.


some
are
based
on
high-level
systemic
features
of
the
brain
,
but
others
focus
on
more
specific
physiological
or
structural
properties
,
with
corresponding
differences
in
their
intended
explanatory
targets
.


most
in
some
way
aim
to
connect
with
theories
of
consciousness
at
other
levels
of
description
such
as
cognitive
,
representational
or
higher-order
theories
.



---------------
in
each
case
the
aim
is
to
explain
how
organization
and
activity
at
the
relevant
neural
level
could
underlie
one
or
another
major
type
or
feature
of
consciousness
.


global
fields
or
transient
synchronous
assemblies
could
underlie
the
intentional
unity
of
phenomenal
consciousness
.


nmda-based
plasticity
,
specific
thalamic
projections
into
the
cortex
,
or
regular
oscillatory
waves
could
all
contribute
to
the
formation
of
short
term
but
widespread
neural
patterns
or
regularities
---------------
one
particular
recent
controversy
has
concerned
the
issue
of
whether
global
or
merely
local
recurrent
activity
is
sufficient
for
phenomenal
consciousness
.


supporters
of
the
global
neuronal
workspace
model

(dehaene
2000
)
have
argued
that
consciousness
of
any
sort
can
occur
only
when
contents
are
activated
with
a
large
scale
pattern
of
recurrent
activity
involving
frontal
and
parietal
areas
as
well
as

sensory
---------------

(2006
)
and
the
philosopher
ned
block
(2007
)
have
argued
that
local
recurrent
activity
between
higher
and
lower
areas
within
sensory
cortex

(e
.

g
.


with
visual
cortex
)
can
suffice
for
phenomenal
consciousness
even
in
the
absence
of
verbal
reportability
and
other
indicators
of
access

quantum
theories

other
physical
theories
have
gone
beyond
the
neural
and
placed
the
natural
locus
of
consciousness
at
a
far
more
fundamental
level
,
in
particular
at
the
micro-physical
level
of
quantum
phenomena
.


according
to
such
theories
,
the
nature
and
basis
of
consciousness
can
not
be
adequately
understood
within
the
framework
of
classical
physics
but
must
be
sought
within
the
alternative
picture
of
physical
reality
provided
by
quantum
mechanics
.


the
proponents
of
the
quantum
consciousness
approach
regard
the
radically
alternative
and
often
counterintuitive
nature
of
quantum
physics
as
just
what
is
needed
to
overcome
the
supposed
---------------
again
there
are
a
wide
range
of
specific
theories
and
models
that
have
been
proposed
,
appealing
to
a
variety
of
quantum
phenomena
to
explain
a
diversity
of
features
of
consciousness
.


it
would
be
impossible
to
catalog
them
here
or
even
explain
in
any
substantial
way
the
key
features
of
quantum
mechanics
to
which
they
appeal
.


however
,
a
brief
---------------

the
physicist
roger
penrose
(1989
,
1994
)
and
the
anesthesiologist
stuart
hameroff
(1998
)
have
championed
a
model
according
to
which
consciousness
arises
through
quantum
effects
occurring
within
subcellular
structures
internal
to
neurons
known
as
microtubules
.


the
model
posits
so
called
---------------

the
psychiatrist
ian
marshall
has
offered
a
model
that
aims
to
explain
the
coherent
unity
of
consciousness
by
appeal
to
the
production
within
the
brain
of
a
physical
state
akin
to
that
of
a
bose-einstein
condensate
.


the
latter
is
a
quantum
phenomenon
in
which
a
collection
of
---------------
similar
coherence
(marshall
and
zohar
1990
)
.



a
basis
for
consciousness
has
also
been
sought
in
the
holistic
nature
of
quantum
mechanics
and
the
phenomenon
of
entanglement
,
according
to
which
particles
that
have
interacted
continue
to
have
their
natures
depend
upon
each
other
even
after
their
separation
.


unsurprisingly
these
models
have
been
targeted
especially
at
explaining
the
coherence
of
consciousness
,
but
they
have
also
been
invoked
as
a
more
general
challenge
to
the
atomistic
conception
of
traditional
physics
according
to
which
the
properties
of
wholes
are
to
be
explained
by
appeal
to
the
properties
of
their
parts
plus
their
mode
of
combination
,
a
method
of
explanation
that
might
be
regarded
as
unsuccessful
to
date
in
explaining
consciousness
(silberstein
1998
,
2001
)
.



others
have
taken
quantum
mechanics
to
indicate
that
consciousness
is
an
absolutely
fundamental
property
of
physical
reality
,
one
that
needs
to
be
brought
in
at
the
very
most
basic
level
(stapp
1993
)
.


they
have
---------------
upon
its
being
consciously
observed
.



there
are
many
other
quantum
models
of
consciousness
to
be
found
in
the
literature—some
advocating
a
radically
revisionist
metaphysics
and
others
not—but
these
four
provide
a
reasonable
,
though
partial
,
sample
---------------
9
.

9
non-physical
theories

most
specific
theories
of
consciousness—whether
cognitive
,
neural
or
quantum
mechanical—aim
to
explain
or
model
consciousness
as
a
natural
feature
of
the
physical
world
.


however
,
those
who
reject
a
physicalist
ontology
of
consciousness
must
find
ways
of
modeling
it
as
a
nonphysical
aspect
of
reality
.


thus
those
who
adopt
a
dualist
or
anti-physicalist
metaphysical
view
must
in
the
end
provide
specific
models
of
consciousness
different
from
the
five
types
above
.


both
substance
dualists
and
property
dualists
must
develop
the
details
of
their
theories
in
ways
that
articulate
the
specific
natures
of
the
relevant
non-physical
features
of
reality
with
which
they
equate
consciousness
or
to
which
they
appeal
in
order
to
explain
it
.



---------------
the
physical
as
itself
derived
from
the
informational
(a
version
of
“it
from
bit”
theory
)
.


in
a
somewhat
similar
vein
,
gregg
rosenberg
has

(2004
)
proposed
an
account
of
consciousness
that
simultaneously
addresses
the
ultimate
categorical
basis
of
causal
relations
.


in
both
the
causal
case
and
the
conscious
case
,
rosenberg
argues
the
---------------
relations
and
qualitative
phenomenal
facts
both
depend
upon
the
same
base
.


also
,
as
noted
just
above
(section
9
.

8
)
,
some
quantum
theories
treat
consciousness
as
a
fundamental
feature
of
reality
(stapp
1993
)
,
and
insofar
as
they
do
so
,
they
might
be
plausibly
classified
as
non-physical
theories
as
well
.


---------------
10
.


conclusion

a
comprehensive
understanding
of
consciousness
will
likely
require
theories
of
many
types
.


one
might
usefully
and
without
contradiction
accept
a
diversity
of
models
that
each
in
their
own
way
aim
respectively
to
explain
the
physical
,
neural
,
cognitive
,
functional
,
representational
and
higher-order
aspects
of
consciousness
.


there
is
unlikely
to
be
any
single
theoretical
perspective
that
suffices
for
explaining
all
the
features
of
consciousness
that
we
wish
to
understand
.


thus
a
synthetic
and
pluralistic
approach
may
provide
the
best
road
to
future
progress
.

consciousness
raising
(also
called
awareness
raising
)
is
a
form
of
activism
popularized
by
united
states
feminists
in
the
late
1960s
.

often

the
form
of

---------------

until
the
early-17th
century
,
english
speakers
used
the
word
"consciousness"
in
the
sense
of
"moral
knowledge
of
right
or
wrong"—a
concept
today
referred
to
as
"conscience"

groups
were
formed
by
new

radical
women
,
an
early
women
'
s
liberation
group
in
new
york
city
,
and
quickly
spread
throughout
the
united
states
.

a
group
including

,
and
carol
hanisch
began
meeting
in

apartment
.


meetings
often
involved
"going
around
the
room
and
talking"
about
issues
in
their
own
lives
.


the
phrase
"consciousness
raising"
was
coined
to
describe
the
process
when
kathie
sarachild
took
up
the
phrase
from
anne
forer
:


in
the
old
left
,
they
used
to
say
that
the
workers
don
'
t
know
they
'
re

oppressed
,
so
we
have
to
raise
their
consciousness
.


one
night
at
a

meeting
i
said
,

'
would
everybody
please
give
me
an
example
from
their

own
life
on
how
they
experienced
oppression
as
a
woman
?


i
need
to
hear

it
to
raise
my
own
consciousness
.


'

kathie
was
sitting
behind
me
and

the
words
rang
in
her
mind
.


from
then
on
she
sort
of
made

on
thanksgiving
1968
,
kathie
sarachild
presented
a
program
for
feminist
consciousness
raising
,
at
the
first
national
women
'
s
liberation
conference
near
chicago
,
illinois
,
in
which
she
explained
the
principles
behind
consciousness-raising
and
outlined
a
program
for
the
process
that
the
new
york
groups
had
developed
over
the
past
year
.


groups
founded
by
former
members
of
new
york
radical
women—in
particular
redstockings
,
founded
out
of
the
breakup
of
the
nyrw
in
1969
,
and
new
york
radical
feminists—promoted
consciousness
raising
and
distributed
mimeographed
sheets
of
suggesting
topics
for
consciousness
raising
group
meetings
.

groups
at
its
peak
.


^
(
[5

)
over
the
next
few
years
,
small-group
consciousness
raising
spread
rapidly
in
cities
and
suburbs
throughout
the
united
states
.


by
1971
,
the
chicago
women
'
s
liberation
union
,
which
had
already
organized
several
consciousness
raising
groups
in
chicago
,
described
small
consciousness
raising
groups
as
"the
backbone
of
the
women
'
s
liberation
movement"
.

(

susan
brownmiller
,
a
member
of
the
west
village
^
(
[a
]
)
would
later
write
that
small-group
consciousness
raising
"was
the
movement
'
s
most
successful
form
of
female
bonding
,
and
the
source
of
most
of
its
creative
thinking
.


some
of
the
small
groups
---------------
as
"personal
,"
or
as
the
results
of
conflicts
between
the
personalities
of
individual
men
and
women
,
rather
than
systematic
forms
of
oppression
.


raising
consciousness
meant
helping
oneself
and
helping
others
to
become
politically
conscious
.


consciousness
raising
groups
aimed
to
get
a
better
understanding
of
women
'
s
oppression
by
bringing
women
together
to
discuss
and
analyze
their
lives
,
without
interference
from
the
presence
of
men
.


^
(
[9
]
)

while
explaining
the
theory
behind
consciousness
raising
in
a
1973
talk
,
kathie
sarachild
remarked
that
"from
the
beginning
of
consciousness-raising 
.


.


.


there
has
been
no
one
method
of
raising
consciousness
.


what
really
counts
in
consciousness-raising
are
not
methods
,
but
results
.


the
only

'
methods
'

of
consciousness
raising
are
essentially
principles
.


they
are
the
basic
radical
political
principles
of
going
to
the
original
sources
,
both
historic
and
personal
,
going
to
people—women
themselves
,
and
going
to
experience
for
theory
and
strategy"
.


^
(
[10
]
)
however
,
most
consciousness
raising
groups
did
follow
a
similar
pattern
for
meeting
and
discussion
.


meetings
would
usually
be
held
about
once
a
week
,
with
a
small
group
of
women
,
often
in
the
living
---------------
knowledge
that
was
shared
.


^
(
[citation

)

some
feminist
advocates
of
consciousness
raising
argued
that
the
process
allowed
women
to
analyze
the
conditions
of
their
own
lives
,
and
to
discover
ways
in
which
what
had
seemed

actions"
.


^
(
[11

)

ellen
willis
wrote
in
1984
that
consciousness
raising
has
often
been
"misunderstood
and
disparaged
as
a
form
of
therapy"
,
but
that
it
was
,
in
fact
,
in
its
time
and
context
,
"the
primary
method
of
understanding

philosophical
assumptions"
.


^
(

however
,
some
in
the
feminist
movement
criticised
consciousness
raising
groups
as
"trivial"
and
apolitical

consciousness
is
the
individual
awareness
of
your
unique
thoughts
,
memories
,
feelings
,
sensations
,
and
environments
.


essentially
,
your
consciousness
is
your
awareness
of
yourself
and
the
world
around
you
.



this
awareness
is
subjective
and
unique
to
you
.


if
you
can
describe
something
you
are
experiencing
in
words
,
then
it
is
part
of
your
consciousness
.



your
conscious
experiences
are
constantly
shifting
and
changing
.


for
example
,
in
one
moment
,
you
may
be
focused
on
reading
this
article
.


your
consciousness
may
then
shift
to
the
memory
of
a
conversation
you
had
earlier
with
a
co-worker
.


next
,
you
might
notice
how
uncomfortable
your
chair
is
,
or
maybe
you
are
mentally
planning
dinner
.


---------------
effortless
.




states
of
consciousness


the
various
states
of
consciousness
include
:

-
dreams
---------------
-
states
induced
by
psychoactive
drugs

the
two
normal
states
of
awareness
are
consciousness
and
unconsciousness
.


higher
states
of
consciousness
are
often
associated
with
spiritual
or
mystical
experiences
.


it
involves
an
elevated
state
of
awareness
where
people
are
able
to
gain
a
greater
sense
of
themselves
,
---------------
states
.

 

altered
levels
of
consciousness
also
can
occur
,
which
may
be
caused
by
medical
or
mental
conditions
that
impair
or
change
awareness
.

 
altered
types
of
consciousness
include
:

-
coma
---------------

doctors
and
healthcare
professionals
use
various
assessments
to
measure
and
assess
levels
of
consciousness
.


they
use
scores
on
these
assessments
to
guide
diagnosis
and
treatment
decisions
.



what
are
the
5
levels
of
consciousness
?



conscious
:
everything
you
are
aware
of
---------------
awareness
and
sensation

subconscious
:
information
that
is
out
of
consciousness
and
not
immediately
available
to
consciousness

what
is
the
unconscious
mind
?




functions
of
consciousness


consciousness
has
several
biological
and
social
purposes
.


for
example
,
it
allows
us
to
process
information
,
choose
our
actions
,
set
priorities
,
learn
and
adapt
to
new
information
,
make
decisions
,
and
more
.



consciousness
is
an
essential
state
in
philosophy
,
spirituality
,
and
religion
.


all
of
these
require
self-awareness
,
which
is
impossible
without
consciousness
.




changes
in
consciousness


understanding
different
levels
of
consciousness
can
help
healthcare
professionals
spot
signs
that
someone
might
be
experiencing
a
problem
.


some
of
these
changes
occur
naturally
;
others
are
the
result
of
factors
such
as
drugs
or
brain
damage
.


changes
to
consciousness
also
can
cause
changes
to
perception
,
thinking
,
understanding
,
and
interpretations
of
the
world
.



changes
in
consciousness
can
sometimes
be
a
sign
of
medical
conditions
or
they
may
even
be
a
sign
of
an
immediate
medical
emergency
.



for
example
,
sudden
changes
in
consciousness
might
be
a
sign
of
:

-
aneurysm
---------------
when
to
seek
help

if
you
thinking
you
are
experiencing
changes
in
consciousness
,
talk
to
your
doctor
.


sudden
changes
may
be
a
sign
of
a
medical
emergency
that
requires
immediate
attention
,
such
as
a
stroke
or
hemorrhage
.

 
---------------
treatment
before
problems
get
worse
.




history
of
consciousness


for
thousands
of
years
,
the
study
of
human
consciousness
was
largely
the
work
of
philosophers
.


the
french
philosopher
rene
descartes
introduced
the
concept
of
mind-body
dualism
or
the
idea
that
while
the
mind
and
---------------
observers
would
carefully
inspect
the
contents
of
their
own
minds
.


obviously
,
this
was
a
very
subjective
process
,
but
it
helped
inspire
further
research
on
the
scientific
study
of
consciousness
.



the
american
psychologist
william
james
compared
consciousness
to
a
stream—unbroken
and
continuous
despite
constant
shifts
and
changes
.


psychoanalyst
sigmund
freud
focused
on
understanding
the
importance
of
---------------
while
the
focus
of
much
of
the
research
in
psychology
shifted
to
purely
observable
behaviors
during
the
first
half
of
the
20th
century
,
research
on
human
consciousness
has
grown
tremendously
since
the
1950s
.




theories
of
consciousness


one
of
the
problems
with
the
study
of
consciousness
is
the
lack
of
a
universally
accepted
operational
definition
.


descartes
proposed
the
idea
of
cogito
ergo
sum
("i
think
,
therefore
i
am"
)
,
which
suggested
that
the
very
act
of
thinking
demonstrates
the
reality
of
one’s
existence
and
consciousness
.



today
,
consciousness
is
generally
defined
as
an
awareness
of
yourself
and
the
world
.


however
,
there
are
still
debates
about
the
different
aspects
of
this
awareness
.



research
on
consciousness
has
focused
on
understanding
the
neuroscience
behind
our
conscious
experiences
.


scientists
have
even
utilized
brain-scanning
technology
to
seek
out
specific
neurons
that
might
be
linked
to
different
conscious
events
.


modern
researchers
have
proposed
two
major
theories
of
consciousness
:
integrated
information
theory
and
global
workspace
theory
.




integrated
information
theory


this
approach
looks
at
consciousness
by
learning
more
about
the
physical
processes
that
underlie
our
conscious
experiences
.


the
theory
attempts
to
create
a
measure
of
the
integrated
information
that
forms
consciousness
.


the
quality
of
an
organism’s
consciousness
is
represented
by
the
level
of
integration
.



---------------
integrated
information
theory
focuses
more
on
identifying
whether
an
organism
is
conscious
,
the
global
workspace
theory
offers
a
much
broader
approach
to
understanding
how
consciousness
works
.



the
different
states
of
consciousness


summary


while
consciousness
has
intrigued
philosophers
and
scientists
for
thousands
of
years
,
experts
clearly
have
a
long
way
to
go
in
our
understanding
of
the
concept
.


researchers
continue
to
explore
the
different
bases
of
consciousness
including
the
physical
,
social
,
cultural
,
and
psychological
influences
that
contribute
to
our
conscious
awareness
.

in
10
voters
with
a
family
income
under
$50
,000
voted
for
a
man
who
promised
to
repeal
the
affordable
care
act
.


this
fact
alone
shows
that
the
working
class
is
not
woke
enough
.


raising
class
consciousness
should
be
a
top
priority
for
left
activists
,
and
we
need
more
ways
to
do
it
.



---------------

as
access
to

and

activists
should
seize
opportunities
to
create
representations
that
further

we
can
also
draw
attention
to

that
do
exist
and

people
interpret
their

granted

not
all
revolutionary
battles
happen
in
the
realm
of
ideology
.


material
struggles
over
economic
structures
and
political
power
are
ultimately
more
important
.


but
raising
class
consciousness
means
finding
allies
so
that
material
struggles
can
be
waged
and
won
.


we
need
to
identify
spaces
within
ideology

in
the
1970s
.


at
that
time
,
it
was
common
for
women
not
to
feel
solidarity
with
other
women
,
and
not
to
accept
that
sexism
was
real
.


feminists
brought
women
together
in
“consciousness
raising”
groups
to
share
their
experiences
.


“i
have
never
been
subjected
to
sexism

a
woman
might
say
.


“i

strong
working-class
identification
provides
the
unifying
factor
that
makes
other

the
same
method
might
work
to
raise
class
consciousness
.


in
a

in

to
critique
,
we
need
positive

to
raise

and
compete
with
the

what
is
consciousness
?



how
to
define
the
elusive
concept
of
consciousness
.

---------------
key
points

-
consciousness
is
the
active
and
subjective
experiencing
aspect
of
an

experience
.


-
consciousness
is
what
transforms
a
biochemical
state
into
an

experience
.


-
although
we
have
mapped
brain
activity
to
specific
conscious
---------------

experiences
.



consciousness
is
what
we
are
most
familiar
with
.


feeling
the
sun
'
s
warmth
on
our
face
,
the
joy
of
seeing
someone
we
love
,
or
the
thrill
of
being
on
a
rollercoaster—every
single
experience
we
ever
had
,
from
sensations
to
thoughts
and
emotions
,
is
linked
to
consciousness
.


it
seems
paradoxical
,
but
despite
being
at
the
centre
of
every
experience
,
consciousness
is
difficult
to
define
and
still
poorly
understood
scientifically
.



we
know
more
about
distant
galaxies
and
the
deepest
ocean
regions
than
we
do
about
our
consciousness
.


even
though
consciousness
has
been
discussed
by
philosophers
for
millennia
and
has
become
an
active
and
thriving
field
of
scientific
research
,
it
remains
largely
a
mystery–but
---------------
intimately
acquainted
with
.



so
,
what
exactly
is
consciousness
?


many
have
tried
to
answer
this
seemingly
simple
question
(i
will
cover
most
of
the
influential
views
on
this
blog
)
,
but
a
universally
agreed-upon
definition
still
seems
---------------
something
extraordinary
happens
:
the
biological
signals
trigger
a
subjective
conscious
experience
.


we
still
don’t
know
much
about
how
or
why
this
happens
,
but
consciousness
lives
on
as
an
indisputable
aspect
of
our
minds
.


although
mysterious
,
it
is
also
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
meaningful
aspects
of
our
human
experience
:
it
makes
life
worth
---------------
the
famous
unalienable
right
to
life
,
liberty
,
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
,
found
in
the
u
.

s
.


declaration
of
independence
,
are
based
on
the
human
capacity
to
have
experiences
.


consciousness
is
the
basis
for
our
experiences
and
undergirds
all
of
this
.



in
its
most
basic
sense
,
consciousness
is
linked
to
experience
.


in
a
way
,
it
turns
a
state
of
the
world
or
a
specific
configuration
of
atoms
,
molecules
,
organs
,
and
everything
else
into
an
experience
.


another
way
---------------
dogma
of
the
ghost
in
the
machine
.

”
a
majority
of
scientists
and
philosophers
reject
this
notion
.


however
,
it
does
mean
that
even
though
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
are
incredibly
useful
,
they
don’t
fully
explain
what
consciousness
is
.



neuroscience
essential
reads
---------------

anil
seth
,
one
of
the
leading
researchers
in
this
field
,
suggests
that
the
ultimate
(or
what
he
calls
the
“real
question
of
consciousness”
)
is
answering
why
a
particular
brain
activity
results
in
a
specific
conscious
experience
and
not
merely
establishing
that
it
does

,
---------------
content
of
an
experience
is
truly
illusionary
(which
few
accept
)
,
the
experience
itself
would
still
be
real
.


any
philosophical
,
psychological
,
or
neurobiological
theory
of
consciousness
is
incomplete
without
a
full
account
of
experiences
,
which
brings
us
back
to
the
act
of
experiencing
.



what
exactly
is
consciousness

so
,
what
exactly
is
consciousness
?


it
is
what
we
are
most
familiar
with
and
what
undergirds
every
perception
,
emotion
,
and
thought
we
have
.


at
the
same
time
,
it
is
an
elusive
notion
that
is
difficult
to
define

in
the
1990s
,

david
chalmers
described
this
inaccessibility
to
external
,
objective
scrutiny
as
the
“hard
problem”
of
consciousness

apart
from
curiosity
,
scientists
are
most
likely
motivated
to
discover
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
in
order
to
help
diagnose
and
treat
disorders
of
consciousness
,
such
as
persistent
vegetative
states
and
some
psychiatric
disorders
.



three
dimensions
of
consciousness

consciousness
has
several
distinct
dimensions
that
they
can
measure
.


three
of
the
most
important
ones
are
:

---------------

these
three
dimensions
interact
to
produce
our
overall
state
of
consciousness
from
moment
to
moment
.


for
example
,
when
wide
awake
,
we
are
in
a
state
of
high
awareness
,
but
as
we
drift
off
to
sleep
at
night
,
both
wakefulness
and
awareness
subside
.


---------------
we
are
awake
.



in
a
similar
way
,
altered
states
of
consciousness
,
such
as
those
induced
by
psychedelic
drugs
or
low
oxygen
levels
,
involve
normal
levels
of
arousal
but
disorganized
sensory
experiences
.


---------------
and
awareness
that
are
even
lower
than
during
non-rem
sleep
.



meanwhile
,
in
a
strange
hybrid
state
of
consciousness
known
as
unresponsive
wakefulness
syndrome
,
or
a
vegetative
state
,
patients
undergo
daily
cycles
of
sleep
and
wakefulness
,
but
without
showing
any
---------------
instructions
or
follow
a
moving
object
with
their
eyes
.



the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness

patients
in
different
states
of
consciousness
have
provided
vital
clues
about
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
.



techniques
such
as
functional
magnetic
resonance
imaging
(fmri
)
and
---------------
network
and
cortical
networks
that
are
involved
in
attention
.



in
disorders
of
consciousness
,
researchers
can
see
reduced
functional
connectivity
and
physical
damage
that
affects
the
connections
between
the
cortex
and
deep
brain
structures
.


---------------

despite
advances
in
our
understanding
of
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
,
however
,
doctors
still
have
trouble
diagnosing
patients
who
are
unable
to
respond
to
questions
or

“consciousness
is
complex
and
studying
it
is
like
solving
a
scrambled
rubik’s
cube
,”

school
department
of

adds

three
gradients
of
consciousness

dr
.


huang
and
his
colleagues
looked
at
how
gradients
of
neural
activity
—
as
measured
by
fmri
—
changed
with
the
three
main
dimensions
of
consciousness
:

-
arousability
or
wakefulness
---------------
system
and
the
somatomotor
cortex
,
which
helps
to
control
movement
.



“we
demonstrated
that
disruptions
of
human
consciousness
—
due
to
pharmacological
,
neuropathological
,
or
psychiatric
causes
—
are
associated
with
a
degradation
of
one
or
more
of
the
major
cortical
---------------
“according
to
our
work
,
cortical
gradient
measurements
have
the
potential
to
reduce
the
uncertainty
of
clinical
assessment
of
consciousness
in
those
patients
,”
he
added
.



transcranial
magnetic
stimulation
---------------
scientists
like
dr
.


huang
have
discovered
a
lot
about
its
neural
correlates
,
but
their
findings
do
not
shed
much
light
on
how
the
brain
generates
consciousness
—
the
“hard
problem”
.



other
scientists
have
argued
that
to
learn
more
about
the
causes
of
consciousness
,
you
have
to
manipulate
brain
activity
and
see
what
happens

theories
of
consciousness

despite
advances
in
our
understanding
of
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
,
the
question
remains
:
how
does
consciousness
arise
from
brain
activity
?



---------------

the
communication
and
integration
of
information
between
brain
regions
is
at
the
heart
of
many
theories
of
consciousness
.



one
of
these
,
iit
,
uses
a
complex
equation
to
calculate
an
entity’s
degree
of
consciousness
from
how
well
it
integrates
information
.



according
to
the
equation
,
even
inanimate
objects
such
as
rocks
and
teapots
have
a
glimmer
of
consciousness
.



this
is
in
keeping
with
the
philosophical
theory
of
panpsychism
,
which
proposes
that
consciousness
is
a
fundamental
property
of
all
physical
systems
.



how
it
feels
to
control
attention

prof
.


graziano
has
a
problem
with
all
these
theories
of
consciousness
.


he
argues
that
they
cannot
even
be
termed
theories
because
they
do
not
actually
explain
consciousness
,
they
only
describe
it
.



he
likens
this
to
the
difference
between
newton’s
law
of
gravitation
,
---------------
theory
of
general
relativity
,
which
explains
what
gravity
actually
is
.



prof
.


graziano’s
own
theory
of
consciousness
,
the
attention
schema
theory
,
or
ast
,
does
not
claim
to
have
cracked
the
hard
problem
of
consciousness
,
but
instead
seeks
to
explain
why
we
believe
we
are
conscious
.



---------------

what
is
more
,
he
argues
that
the
attention
schema
leads
people
to
believe
that
they
have
an
internal
essence
—consciousness
—
that
allows
them
to
focus
their
attention
.



---------------
sense
of
selfhood
,
time
,
or
space
.



this
special
state
of
consciousness
has
provided
more
clues
about
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
.



researchers
at
the
university
of
freiburg
in
germany
used

study

read

is
consciousness
part
of
the
fabric
of
the
universe
?



a
theory
called
panpsychism
proposes
that
consciousness
is
a
fundamental
aspect
of
reality

---------------
galileo
recognized
that
not
everything
was
amenable
to
a
quantitative
approach
.


such
things
as
colors
,
tastes
and
smells
“are
no
more
than
mere
names
,”
galileo
declared
,
for
“they
reside
only
in
consciousness
.

”
these
qualities
aren’t
really
out
there
in
the
world
,
he
asserted
,
but
exist
only
in
the
minds
of
creatures
that
perceive
them
.


“hence
if
the
---------------
since
galileo’s
time
the
physical
sciences
have
leaped
forward
,
explaining
the
workings
of
the
tiniest
quarks
to
the
largest
galaxy
clusters
.


but
explaining
things
that
reside
“only
in
consciousness”—the
red
of
a
sunset
,
say
,
or
the
bitter
taste
of
a
lemon—has
proven
far
more
difficult
.


neuroscientists
have
identified
a
number
of
neural
correlates
of
consciousness—brain
states
associated
with
specific
mental
states—but
have
not
explained
how
matter
forms
minds
in
the
first
place
.


as
philosopher
colin
mcginn
put
it
in
a
1989
paper
,
“somehow
,
we
feel
,
the
water
of
the
physical
brain
is
turned
into
the
wine
of
consciousness
.

”
philosopher
david
chalmers
famously
dubbed
this
quandary the
“hard
problem”
of
consciousness
.

*

scholars
recently
gathered
to
debate
the
problem
at
marist
college
in
poughkeepsie
,
n
.

y
.


,
during
a
two-day
workshop
focused
on
an
idea
known
as panpsychism
.


the
concept
proposes
that
consciousness
is
a
fundamental
aspect
of
reality
,
like
mass
or
electrical
charge
.


the
idea
goes
back
to
antiquity—plato
took
it
seriously—and
has
had
some
prominent
supporters
---------------
hall
with
floor-to-ceiling
windows
overlooking
the
hudson
river
,
roughly
two
dozen
scholars
probed
the
possibility
that
perhaps
it’s
consciousness
all
the
way
down
.



part
of
the
appeal
of
panpsychism
is
that
it
appears
to
provide
a
---------------
particles
might
be
somehow
aware
.


he
said
in
a
ted
talk
that
a
photon
“might
have
some
element
of
raw
,
subjective
feeling
,
some
primitive
precursor
to
consciousness
.

”
also
on
board
with
the
idea
is
neuroscientist
christof
koch
,
who
noted
in
his
2012
book
consciousness
that
if
one
accepts
consciousness
as
a
real
phenomenon
that’s
not
dependent
on
any
particular
material—that
it’s
“substrate-independent
,”
as
philosophers
put
it—then
“it
is
a
simple
step
to
conclude
that
the
---------------

yet
panpsychism
runs
counter
to
the
majority
view
in
both
the
physical
sciences
and
in
philosophy
that
treats
consciousness
as
an
emergent
phenomenon
,
something
that
arises
in
certain
complex
systems
,
such
as
human
brains
.


in
this
view
,
individual
neurons
are
not
conscious
,
but
---------------
theories
,
“most
physicists
think
about
experiments
,”
he
said
.


“i
think
they
should
be
thinking
,
‘is
my
theory
compatible
with
consciousness
?

’—because
we
know
that’s
real
.

”

many
philosophers
at
the
meeting
appeared
to
share
goff’s
concern
that
physicalism
falters
when
it
comes
to
consciousness
.


“if
you
know
every
last
detail
about
my
brain
processes
,
you
still
wouldn’t
know
what
it’s
like
to
be
me
,”
says
hedda
hassel
mørch
,
a
philosopher
at
inland
norway
---------------

but
panpsychism
attracts
many
critics
as
well
.


some
point
out
that
it
doesn’t
explain
how
small
bits
of
consciousness
come
together
to
form
more
substantive
conscious
entities
.


detractors
say
that
this
puzzle
,
known
as
the
“combination

carroll
argued
that

actually

that

consciousness

many
phenomena
that
can’t
be
inferred
from
the
goings-on
at
the
microscopic
level
,
it
is
nonetheless

both boil
down
to
the

key
question
:
is
there
something
about
consciousness
that
cannot
be
accounted
for
by
physical
facts
alone
?


much
of
the
rhetorical
ping-pong
between
goff
and
carroll
amounted
to
goff
answering
yes
to
that

and
carroll
answering
no

paul
draper
,
a
philosopher
at
purdue
university
who
participated
via
zoom
,
talked
about
a
subtly
different
idea
known
as
“psychological
ether
theory”—essentially
that
brains
don’t
produce
consciousness
but
rather
make
use
of
consciousness
.


in
this
view
,
consciousness
was
already
there
before
brains
existed
,
like
an
all-pervasive
ether
.


if
the
idea
is
correct
,
he
writes
,
“then
(in
all
likelihood
)
god
exists

”
---------------
increasingly
popular
idea
in
physics
lately
that
space
and
time
may
not
be
fundamental
but
may
instead
be
emergent
phenomena
themselves
.


)
the
deeper
entity
related
to
consciousness
,
hoffman
suggests
,
may
consist
of
“subjects
and
experiences”
that
he
says
“are
entities
beyond
spacetime
,
not
within
spacetime
.

”
he
developed
this
idea
in
a
2023
paper
entitled
“fusions
of
consciousness

.


“critiquing
physicalism
on
the
basis
that
it
has
‘failed’
is
willful
mischaracterization
,”
he
says
.


“it’s
doing
just
fine
,
as
progress
in
consciousness
science
readily
attests
.

”
in
a
recently
published
article
in
the
journal
of
consciousness
studies
,
seth
adds
:
“asserting
that
consciousness
is
fundamental
and
ubiquitous
does
nothing
to
shed
light
on
the
way
an
experience
of
blueness
is
the
way
it
is
,
and
not
some
other
way
.


nor
does
it
explain
anything
about
the
possible
functions
of
consciousness
,
nor
why
consciousness
is
lost
in
states
such
as
dreamless
sleep
,
general
anaesthesia
,
and
coma
.

”

even
those
who
lean
toward
panpsychism
sometimes
seem
hesitant
to
dive
into
the
deep
end
.


as
garcia
put
it
,
in
spite
of
the
allure
of
a
universe
imbued
with
consciousness
,
“i
would
love

the
universal
mind
,
or
universal
consciousness
,
is
a
metaphysical
concept
suggesting
an
underlying
essence
of
all
beings
and
becoming
in
the
universe
.


it
includes
the
being
and
becoming
that
occurred
in
the
universe
prior
to
the
emergence
of
the
concept
of
mind
,
a
term
that
more
appropriately
refers
to
the
organic
,
human
aspect
of
universal
consciousness
.


it
addresses
inorganic
being
and
becoming
and
the
interactions
that
occur
in
that
process
without
specific
reference
to
the
physical
and
chemical
laws
that
try
to
describe
those
interactions
.


those
interactions
have
occurred
,
do
occur
,
and
continue
to
occur
.


universal
consciousness
is
the
source
that
underlies
those
interactions
and
the
awareness
and
knowledge
they
imply
.

is

universal
?



panpsychism
,
the
ancient
doctrine
that
consciousness
is
universal
,
offers
some
lessons
in
how
to
think
about
subjective
experience
today

---------------
would
god
resurrect
people
but
not
dogs
?


this
core
christian
belief
in
human
exceptionalism
did
not
make
any
sense
to
me
.


whatever
consciousness
and
mind
are
and
no
matter
how
they
relate
to
the
brain
and
the
rest
of
the
body
,
i
felt
that
the
same
principle
must
hold
for
people
and
dogs
and
,
by
extension
,
for
other
animals
as
well
.


---------------
and
its
emphasis
on
the
universal
nature
of
mind
.


indeed
,
when
i
spent
a
week
with
his
holiness
the
dalai
lama
earlier
in
2013
[see
“the
brain
of
buddha
,”
consciousness
redux
;
scientific
american
mind
,
july/august

]
,
i
noted
how
often
he
talked
about
the
need
to
reduce
the
suffering
of
“all
living
beings”
and
not
just
“all
people
.

”
my
readings
---------------
mice
,
whales
,
dogs
,
cats
and
monkeys—are
capable
of
sophisticated
,
learned
,
nonstereotyped
behaviors
that
would
be
associated
with
consciousness
if
a
human
were
to
carry
out
such
actions
.


precursors
of
behaviors
thought
to
be
unique
to
people
are
found
in
many
species
.


for
instance
,
bees
are
capable
of
recognizing
specific
faces
from
---------------

some
people
point
to
language
and
the
associated
benefits
as
being
the
unique
defining
feature
of
consciousness
.


conveniently
,
this
viewpoint
rules
out
all
but
one
species
,
homo
sapiens
(which
has
an
ineradicable
desire
to
come
out
on
top
)
,
as
having
sentience
.


yet
there
is
little
reason
to
deny
consciousness
to
animals
,
preverbal
infants
[see
“the
conscious
infant
,”
consciousness
redux
;
scientific
american
mind
,
september/october
2013
]
or
patients
with
severe
aphasia
,
all
of
whom
are
mute
.


---------------
i
will
defend
a
narrowed
,
more
nuanced
view
:
namely
that
any
complex
system
,
as
defined
below
,
has
the
basic
attributes
of
mind
and
has
a
minimal
amount
of
consciousness
in
the
sense
that
it
feels
like
something
to
be
that
system
.


if
the
system
falls
apart
,
consciousness
ceases
to
be
;
it
doesn
'
t
feel
like
anything
to
be
a
broken
system
.


and
the
more
complex
the
system
,
the
larger
the
repertoire
of
conscious
---------------
hold
the
weight
of
philosophy
.


but
from
whence
does
this
experience
come
?


materialists
invoke
something
they
call
emergentism
to
explain
how
consciousness
can
be
absent
in
simple
nervous
systems
and
emerge
as
their
complexity
increases
.


consider
the
wetness
of
water
,
its
ability
to
maintain
contact
with
surfaces
.


it
is
a
consequence
of
intermolecular
---------------
conscious
states
to
be
bridged
by
bigger
brains
or
more
complex
neurons
.



a
more
principled
solution
is
to
assume
that
consciousness
is
a
basic
feature
of
certain
types
of
so-called
complex
systems
(defined
in
some
universal
,
mathematical
manner
)
.


and
that
complex
systems
have
---------------
intrinsic
property
of
these
particles
.


electrical
charge
does
not
emerge
from
noncharged
matter
.


it
is
the
same
,
goes
the
logic
,
with
consciousness
.


consciousness
comes
with
organized
chunks
of
matter
.


it
is
immanent
in
the
organization
of
the
system
.


it
is
a
property
of
complex
entities
and
cannot
be
further
reduced
to
the
action
of
more
---------------
flaws
.


one
is
known
as
the
problem
of
aggregates
.


philosopher
john
searle
of
the
university
of
california
,
berkeley
,
expressed
it
recently
:
“consciousness
cannot
spread
over
the
universe
like
a
thin
veneer
of
jam
;
there
has
to
be
a
point
where
my
consciousness
ends
and
yours
begins
.

”
indeed
,
if
consciousness
is
everywhere
,
why
should
it
not
animate
the
iphone
,
the
internet
or
the
united
states
of
america
?


furthermore
,
panpsychism
does
not
explain
why
a
healthy
brain
is
---------------
conscious
experience
is
a
fundamental
aspect
of
reality
and
is
identical
to
a
particular
type
of
information—integrated
information
.


consciousness
depends
on
a
physical
substrate
but
is
not
reducible
to
it
.


that
is
,
my
experience
of
seeing
an
aquamarine
blue
is
inexorably
linked
to
my
brain
but
is
different
from
my
brain
.


---------------
part
of
your
view
.


whatever
information
you
are
conscious
of
is
wholly
and
completely
presented
to
your
mind
;
it
cannot
be
subdivided
.


underlying
this
unity
of
consciousness
is
a
multitude
of
causal
interactions
among
the
relevant
parts
of
your
brain
.


if
parts
of
the
brain
become
fragmented
and
balkanized
,
as
occurs
in
deep
sleep
or
in
anesthesia
,
consciousness
fades
.



to
be
conscious
,
then
,
you
need
to
be
a
single
,
integrated
entity
with
a
---------------
extent
to
which
this
network
is
integrated
.


from
this
calculation
,
the
theory
derives
a
single
number

“fi”
)
[see
“a

of
consciousness

consciousness

.


measured
in
bits
,
&phgr
denotes
the
size
of
the
conscious
repertoire
associated
with
the
network
of
causally
interacting
---------------
low
.


if
the
organism
has
many
neurons
and
is
richly
endowed
with
synaptic
connections
,
&phgr
will
be
high
.


basically
,
&phgr
captures
the
quantity
of
consciousness
.


the
quality
of
any
one
experience—the
way
in
which
red
feels
different
from
blue
and
a
color
is
perceived
differently
from
a
tone—is
conveyed
by
the
informational
geometry
associated
with
---------------

integrated
information
makes
very
specific
predictions
about
which
brain
circuits
are
involved
in
consciousness
and
which
ones
are
peripheral
players
(even
though
they
might
contain
many
more
neurons
,
their
anatomical
wiring
differs
)
.


the
theory
has
most
recently
been
used
to
build
a
consciousness
meter
to
assess
,
in
a
quantitative
manner
,
the
extent
to
which
anesthetized
subjects
or
severely
brain-injured
patients
,
such
as
terri
schiavo
,
who
died
in
florida
in
2005
,
are
truly
not
conscious
or
do
have
some
conscious
experiences
but
are
unable
to
signal
their
pain
and
discomfort
to
their
loved
ones
[see

antonio
gramsci
states
,
“a
collective
consciousness
,
which
is
to
say
a
living
organism
,
is
formed
only
after
the
unification
of
the
multiplicity
through
friction
on
the
part
of
the
individuals
;
nor
can
one
say
that
‘silence’
is
not
a
multiplicity
.

”
^
(
[13
]
)
a
form
of
collective
consciousness
can
be
formed
from
gramsci
'
s
conception
that
the
presence
of
a
hegemony
can
mobilize
the
collective
consciousness
of
those
oppressed
by
the
ruling
ideas
of
society
,
or
the
ruling
hegemony
.


collective
consciousness
can
refer
to
a
multitude
of
different
individual
forms
of
consciousness
coalescing
into
a
greater
whole
.


in
gramsci
'
s
view
,
a
unified
whole
is
composed
of
solidarity
among
its
different
constituent
parts
,
and
therefore
,
this
whole
cannot
be
uniformly
the
same
.


the
unified
whole
can
embrace
different
forms
of
consciousness
(or
individual
experiences
of
social
reality
)
,
which
coexist
to
reflect
the
different
experiences
of
the
marginalized
peoples
in
a
given
society
.


this
agrees
with
gramsci
'
s
theory
of
marxism
and
class
struggle
applied
to
cultural
contexts
.


cultural
marxism
(as
distinguished
from
the
right-wing
use
of
the
term
)
embodies
the
concept
of
collective
consciousness
.


it
incorporates
social
movements
that
are
based
on
some
sort
of
collective
identity
;
these
identities
can
include
,
for
instance
,
gender
,

whether
this
form
of

finds
itself
in

the

is
up
to
the

take

in
gramsci
'
s
prison

,
the
ongoing
conflict
between
civil
society
,
the
bureaucracy
,
and
the
state
necessitates
the
emergence
of
a
collective
consciousness
that
can
often
act
as
an
intermediary
between
these
different
realms
.


the
public
organizations
of
protest
,
such
as
labor
unions
and
anti-war
organizations
,
are
vehicles
that
can
unite
multiple
types
of
collective
consciousness
.


although
identity-based
movements
are
necessary
for
the
progress
of
democracy
and
can
generate
collective
consciousness
,
they
cannot
completely
do
so
without
a
unifying
framework
.


this
is
why
anti-war
and
labor
movements
provide
an
avenue
that
has
united
various
social
movements
under
the
banner
of
a
multiple
collective
consciousness
.


this
is
also
why
future
social
movements
need
to
have
an
ethos
of
collective
consciousness
if
they
are
to
succeed
in
the
long-term

what
is
durkheim
'
s
theory
of
collective
consciousness
?



Émile
durkheim
,
a
pioneering
figure
in
sociology
,
coined
the
french
term
"conscience
collective
.

"
his
idea
of
collective
consciousness
refers
to
beliefs
and
sentiments
common
to
average
members
of
society
,
forming
a
determinate
system
that
has
its
own
life
.


according
to
durkheim
,
this
---------------
light
on
how
societies
maintain
cohesion
and
solidarity
.



what
did
carl
jung
mean
by
collective
consciousness
?



carl
jung
,
the
pioneering
swiss
psychiatrist
and
psychoanalyst
,
expanded
upon
prevailing
notions
of
shared
human
experience
.


while
earlier
thinkers
like
durkheim
had
raised
the
subject
of
this
"collective
consciousness"
—
a
shared
set
of
beliefs
,
values
,
and
societal
norms
that
bind
communities
together
,
jung
ventured
deeper
.



---------------

this
is
where
the
distinction
and
interplay
between
"collective
consciousness"
and
"collective
unconscious"
become
crucial
.



durkheim
'
s
collective
consciousness
captures
the
conscious
agreements
that
make
societal
cohesion
possible
—
the
realm
of
shared
traditions
,
laws
,
and
cultural
norms
.



building
upon
this
understanding
,
jung
proposed
that
the
collective
unconscious
lies
beneath
this
layer
of
shared
consciousness
.

 
this
realm
is
not
about
societal
agreements
but
taps
into
innate
,
universal
symbols
and
themes
that
inform
societal
structures
and
animate
our
dreams
,
---------------

similarly
,
studies
have
highlighted
instances
of
collective
consciousness
during
advanced
states
of
group
meditation
and
within
oral
cultures
,
such
as
the
australian
aborigines
and
the
san
people
of
africa
.


---------------
emotions
.


there
is
speculation
that
these
neurons
could
be
central
in
fostering
collective
experiences
,
playing
a
significant
role
in
the
emergence
of
language
and
reflective
self-consciousness
.

in

the
concept
of
collective
consciousness

what
it
is
and
how
it
holds
society
together
---------------
updated
on
january
16
,
2019

collective
consciousness
(sometimes
collective
conscience
or
conscious
)
is
a
fundamental
sociological
concept
that
refers
to
the
set
of
shared
beliefs
,
ideas
,
attitudes
,
and
knowledge
that
are
common
to
a
social
group
or
society
.


the
collective
consciousness
informs
our
sense
of
belonging
and
identity
,
and
our
behavior
.


founding
sociologist
Émile
durkheim
developed
this
concept
to
explain
how
unique
individuals
are
bound
together
into
collective
units
like
social
groups
and
societies
.




how
collective
consciousness
holds
society
together


what
is
it
that
holds
society
together
?


this
was
the
central
question
---------------
because
unique
individuals
feel
a
sense
of
solidarity
with
each
other
.


this
is
why
we
can
form
collectives
and
work
together
to
achieve
community
and
functional
societies
.


the
collective
consciousness
,
or conscience
collective as
he
wrote
it
in
french
,
is
the
source
of
this
solidarity
.



durkheim
first
introduced
his
theory
of
the
collective
consciousness
in
his
1893
book
"the
division
of
labor
in
society"
.


(later
,
he
would
also
rely
on
the
concept
in
other
books
,
including
"rules
of
the
sociological
---------------
and
sentiments
common
to
the
average
members
of
a
society
.

"
durkheim
observed
that
in
traditional
or
primitive
societies
, religious
symbols
,
discourse
,
beliefs
,
and
rituals
fostered
the
collective
consciousness
.


in
such
cases
,
where
social
groups
were
quite
homogenous
(not
distinct
by
race
or
class
,
for
example
)
,
the
collective
consciousness
resulted
in
what
durkheim
termed
a
"mechanical
solidarity"
—
in
effect
an
automatic
binding
together
of
people
into
a
collective
through
their
shared
---------------
others
in
order
to
allow
for
a
society
to
function
.


in
cases
such
as
these
,
religion
still
played
an
important
role
in
producing
collective
consciousness
among
groups
of
people
affiliated
with
various
religions
,
but
other
social
institutions
and
structures
would
also
work
to
produce
the
collective
consciousness
necessary
for
this
more
complex
form
of
solidarity
,
and
rituals
outside
of
religion
would
play
important
roles
in
reaffirming
it
.




social
institutions
produce
collective
consciousness


these
other
institutions
include
the
state
(which
fosters
patriotism
and
---------------

in
either
case
—
primitive
or
modern
societies
—
collective
consciousness
is
something
"common
to
the
whole
of
society
,"
as
durkheim
put
it
.


it
is
not
an
individual
condition
or
phenomenon
,
but
a
social
one
.


as
a
social
phenomenon
,
it
is
"diffused
across
society
as
a
whole
,"
and
"has
a
life
of
its
own
.

"
it
is
through
collective
consciousness
that
values
,
beliefs
,
and
traditions
can
be
passed
down
through
generations
.


though
individual
people
live
and
die
,
this
collection
of
intangible
---------------
our
social
institutions
and
thus
exist
independent
of
individual
people
.



most
important
to
understand
is
that
collective
consciousness
is
the
result
of
social
forces
that
are
external
to
the
individual
,
that
course
through
society
,
and
that
work
together
to
create
the
social
phenomenon
of
the
shared
set
of
beliefs
,
values
,
and
ideas
that
compose
it
.


we
,
as
individuals
,
internalize
these
and make
the
collective
consciousness
a
reality
by
doing
so
,
and
we
reaffirm
and
reproduce
it
by
living
in
ways
that
reflect
it
.

in
marxism
,
class
consciousness
is
the
set
of
beliefs
that
persons
hold
regarding
their
social
class
or
economic
rank
in
society
,
the
structure
of
their
class
,
and
their
common
class
interests
.

(

)
according
to
karl
marx
,
class
consciousness
is
an
awareness
that
is
key
to
sparking
a
revolution
which
would
"create
a
dictatorship
of
the
proletariat
,
transforming
it
from
a
wage-earning
,
propertyless
mass
into
the
ruling
class"
.


^
(
[3

)

although
marxists
tend
to
focus
on
class
consciousness
(or
its
absence
)
among
the
proletariat
,
the
upper
classes
in
society
can
also
think
and
act
in
a
class-conscious
way
.


as
leonard
fein
pointed
out
,
"the
very
rich
have
been
well
aware
of
their
class
privilege
and
have
labored
mightily
to
protect
and
defend
it"
.

for
example
,
warren
buffett
has
demonstrated
class
consciousness
:
"there

.

but

reinforced
by
the
new
gentry
who
owed
their
success
to
commerce
,
industry
,
and
the
professions
,
evolved
into
an

'
upper
class
'

(its
consciousness
formed
in
large
part
by
the
public
schools
and
universities
)
which
tenaciously
maintained
control
over
the
political
system
,
depriving
not
only
the
working
classes
but
the
middle
classes
of
---------------
to
become
more
acutely
conscious
of
its
position
in
the
hierarchy
.


^
(
[7
]
)

while
karl
marx
rarely
used
the
term
"class
consciousness"
,
he
did
make
the
distinction
between
"class
in
itself"
,
which
is
defined
as
a
stratum
of
society
sharing
common
grievances
and
a
unified
perspective
;
and
a
---------------
education
,
occupation
,
or
status
.


^
(

whereas
marx
believed
the
working
class
would
gain
class
consciousness
as
a
result
of
its
experience
of
exploitation
,
later
orthodox
marxism
,
in
particular
as
formulated
by
vladimir
lenin
,
argued
that
the
working
class
,
by
itself
,
could
only
develop
"trade
union
consciousness"
,
which
lenin
characterized
in
what
is
to
be
done
?


as
"the
conviction
that
it
is
necessary
to
combine
in
unions
,
fight
the
employers
,
and
strive
to
---------------
overcome
this
(in
lenin
'
s
opinion
)
limited
worldview
,
a
vanguard
party
of
the
most
politically
advanced
section
of
the
working
class
was
needed
to
help
replace
trade
union
consciousness
with
class
consciousness
.

criticism
---------------

the
polish
political
philosopher
leszek
kolakowski
disputed
the
notion
that
class
consciousness
could
be
instilled
from
outside
by
a
vanguard
party
.


in
main
currents
of
marxism
and
his
other
writings
,
he
stated
that
in
order
to
achieve
a
unity
of
theory
and
praxis
,
theory
must
not
---------------
"expression
of
the
revolutionary
process
itself"
.


in
turn
,
a
theory
which
has
as
its
goal
helping
the
proletariat
achieve
class
consciousness
must
first
be
an
"objective
theory
of
class
consciousness"
.


however
,
theory
in
itself
is
insufficient
,
and
ultimately
relies
on
the
struggle
of
humankind
and
of
the
proletariat
for
consciousness
:
the
"objective
theory
of
class
consciousness
is
only
the
theory
of
its
objective
possibility"
.

since

it

why

class
consciousness
,
the
self-understanding
of
members
of
a
social
class
.


this
modern
sociological
concept
has
its
origins
in
,
and
is
closely
associated
with
,
marxist
theory
.



although
karl
marx
himself
did
not
articulate
a
theory
of
class
consciousness
,
he
intimated
the
concept
in
his
characterization
of
the
working
class
.


according
to
marx
,
workers
first
become
conscious
of
sharing
common
grievances
against
capitalists
(thus
forming
a
class
“in
itself”
)
and
eventually
develop
an
awareness
of
themselves
as
forming
a
social
class
opposed
to
the
bourgeoisie
(thus
becoming
a
class
“for
itself”
)
,
the
proletariat
.


class
consciousness
is
a
historical
phenomenon
,
born
out
of
collective
struggle
.


in
this
sense
,
marx
did
not
approach
class
consciousness
as
a
matter
of
pure
ideality
.


rejecting
any
separation
of
theory
and
practice
,
he
used
the
term
“conscious
human
practices”
to
emphasize
the
conjunction
of
subjectivity
and
objectivity
in
history
.



in
his
seminal
study
of
class
consciousness
,
the
hungarian
marxist
philosopher
györgy
lukács
stressed
the
need
to
distinguish
between
class
consciousness
and
the
ideas
or
feelings
actually
held
by
the
members
of
a
social
class
.


an
objective
analysis
of
class
consciousness
,
according
to
lukács
,
must
take
into
account
those
thoughts
and
feelings
but
also
those
that
the
members
would
have
held
were
they
able
to
acquire
a
true
---------------

because
marxism
considers
social
classes
to
have
objective
identities
and
interests
,
its
conception
of
class
consciousness
includes
the
possibility
of
its
antithesis
:
false
consciousness
.


broadly
defined
,
false
consciousness
refers
to
a
distorted
understanding
of
one’s
class
identity
and
interest
.


from
the
perspective
of
marxism
,
it
concerns
primarily
the
tension
between
the
historical
mission
of
the
working
class
(to
destroy
capitalism
and
realize
the
socialist
revolution
)
and
its
understanding
thereof
.


the
problem
of
false
consciousness
has
encouraged
an
elitist
streak
in
marxism
.



although
false
consciousness
is
an
error
,
it
is
not
baseless
or
purely
fictitious
.


it
is
itself
historically
determined
.


for
marx
,
capitalism
is
in
a
perpetual
and
eventually
fatal
state
of
crisis
.


capitalism
---------------
the
class
structure
and
relinquishing
their
class
privilege
.


in
that
sense
,
the
economic
and
political
ideology
of
the
bourgeoisie
is
a
form
of
false
consciousness
,
but
it
is
nonetheless
objectively
determined
by
the
historical
position
of
that
class
.



after
marx
,
socialist
thinkers
diverged
on
the
status
of
working-class
consciousness
.


some
were
optimistic
and
considered
the
working
class
to
be
naturally
in
tune
with
its
class
interest
and
spontaneously
revolutionary
;
others
,
like
lenin
,
argued
that
the
working
class
did
not
---------------

in
a
seminal
redefinition
,
the
sociologist
michael
mann
examined
different
dimensions
of
class
consciousness
:
class
belonging
and
identity
,
class
antagonism
,
class
totality
(the
idea
that
social
classes
encompass
the
entirety
of
society
)
,
and
the
vision
of
a
classless
---------------
solidarity
.


for
instance
,
the
experience
of
economic
exploitation
can
lead
workers
to
recognize
that
they
have
a
stake
in
each
other’s
well-being
,
and
from
there
they
will
develop
class
consciousness
and
class
solidarity
.


mann’s
focus
was
placed
on
consciousness
itself
and
thus
departed
to
some
extent
from
marx’s
attempt
to
embed
consciousness
in
social
practices
.



---------------
subscribe

despite
its
marxist
origin
,
the
concept
of
class
consciousness
is
not
necessarily
predicated
on
a
revolutionary
view
of
history
.


the
sociologist
karl
mannheim
,
for
instance
,
associated
social
classes
with
---------------
or
part
of
the
elite
.


the
result
is
a
more
or
less
partial
and
distorted
understanding
,
necessarily
skewed
by
interest
.


mannheim
thus
identified
class
consciousness
with
ideological
alienation
.


therefore
,
the
solution
lies
not
in
greater
class
solidarity
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
in
acquiring
a
more-enlightened
understanding
by
approaching
reality
from
a
multiplicity
of
perspectives
.


it
is
important
to
note
that
marx
and
mannheim
did
not
consider
all
forms
of
knowledge
to
be
equally
affected
by
class
consciousness
;
they
regarded
mathematics
and
science
to
be
free
of
its
influence
.



the
concept
of
class
consciousness
receded
in
public
discourse
with
the
fall
of
communist
regimes
at
the
end
of
the
20th
century
.


nevertheless
,
the
idea
continues
to
raise
important
sociological
questions
,
such
as
these
:
what
is
the
relationship
between
economic
condition
and
subjectivity
?


what
is
the
role
of
the
intelligentsia
in
bringing
about
political
change
?


are
there
collective
forms
of
consciousness
and
,
if
so
,
what
is
their
political
efficacy
?

---------------
the
division
of
society
into
classes
is
determined
by
position
within
the
process
of
production
.


but
what
,
then
,
is
the
meaning
of
class
consciousness
?


the
question
at
once
branches
out
into
a
series
of
closely
interrelated
problems
.


first
of
all
,
how
are
we
to
understand
class
consciousness
(in
theory
)
?


second
,
what
is
the
(practical
)
function
of
class
consciousness
,
so
understood
,
in
the
context
of
the
class
struggle
?


this
leads
to
the
further
question
:
is
the
problem
of
class
consciousness
a
‘general’
sociological
problem
or
does
it
mean
one
thing
for
the
proletariat
and
another
for
every
other
class
to
have
emerged
hitherto
?


and
lastly
,
is
class
consciousness
homogeneous
in
nature
and
function
or
can
we
discern
different
gradations
and
levels
in
it
?


and
if
so
,
what
are
their
practical
implications
for
the
class
---------------
scientific
marxism
consists
,
then
,
in
the
realisation
that
the
real
motor
forces
of
history
are
independent
of
man’s
(psychological
)
consciousness
of
them
.



at
a
more
primitive
stage
of
knowledge
this
independence
takes
the
form
---------------
political
theory
of
classical
german
philosophy
and
in
the
economic
theory
of
adam
smith
and
ricardo
.


marx
opposes
to
them
a
critical
philosophy
,
a
theory
of
theory
and
a
consciousness
of
consciousness
.


this
critical
philosophy
implies
above
all
historical
criticism
.


it
dissolves
the
rigid
,
unhistorical
,
natural
appearance
of
social
---------------

it
might
look
as
though
by
dissolving
the
dilemma
in
this
manner
we
were
denying
consciousness
any
decisive
role
in
the
process
of
history
.


it
is
true
that
the
conscious
reflexes
of
the
different
stages
of
economic
growth
remain
historical
facts
of
great
importance
;
it
is
true
that
---------------
does
not
deny
that
men
perform
their
historical
deeds
themselves
and
that
they
do
so
consciously
.


but
as
engels
emphasises
in
a
letter
to
mehring
,
^
(
[9
]
)
this
consciousness
is
false
.


however
,
the
dialectical
method
does
not
permit
us
simply
to
proclaim
the
‘falseness’
of
this
consciousness
and
to
persist
in
an
inflexible
confrontation
of
true
and
false
.


on
the
contrary
,
it
requires
us
to
investigate
this
‘false
consciousness’
concretely
as
an
aspect
of
the
historical
totality
and
as
a
stage
in
the
historical
process
.



---------------

(’individual’
here
can
refer
to
an
individual
man
,
class
or
people
)
and
in
his
empirically
given
(and
hence
psychological
or
mass-psychological
)
consciousness
.


and
just
when
they
imagine
that
they
have
discovered
the
most
concrete
thing
of
all
:
society
as
a
concrete
totality
,
the
system
of
production
at
a
given
point
in
history
and
the
resulting
division
of
---------------

concrete
analysis
means
then
:
the
relation
to
society
as
a
whole
.


for
only
when
this
relation
is
established
does
the
consciousness
of
their
existence
that
men
have
at
any
given
time
emerge
in
all
its
essential
characteristics
.


it
appears
,
on
the
one
hand
,
as
something
which
is
---------------
same
time
,
objectively
,
it
by-passes
the
essence
of
the
evolution
of
society
and
fails
to
pinpoint
it
and
express
it
adequately
.


that
is
to
say
,
objectively
,
it
appears
as
a
‘false
consciousness’
.


on
the
other
hand
,
we
may
see
the
same
consciousness
as
something
which
fails
subjectively
to
reach
its
self-appointed
goals
,
while
furthering
and
realising
the
objective
aims
of
society
of
which
it
is
ignorant
and
which
it
did
not
choose
.



this
twofold
dialectical
determination
of
‘false
consciousness’
constitutes
an
analysis
far
removed
from
the
naive
description
of
what
men
in
fact
thought
,
felt
and
wanted
at
any
moment
in
history
and
from
---------------
genuine
historical
analysis
.


the
relation
with
concrete
totality
and
the
dialectical
determinants
arising
from
it
transcend
pure
description
and
yield
the
category
of
objective
possibility
.


by
relating
consciousness
to
the
whole
of
society
it
becomes
possible
to
infer
the
thoughts
and
feelings
which
men
would
have
in
a
particular
situation
if
they
were
---------------
distinguished
basic
types
whose
characteristics
are
determined
by
the
types
of
position
available
in
the
process
of
production
.


now
class
consciousness
consists
in
fact
of
the
appropriate
and
rational
reactions
‘imputed’
[zugerechnet
]
to
a
particular
typical
position
in
the
process
of
production
.


^
(
[11
]
)
this
consciousness
is
,
therefore
,
neither
the
sum
nor
the
average
of
what
is
thought
or
felt
by
the
single
individuals
who
make
up
the
class
.


and
yet
the
historically
significant
actions
of
the
class
as
a
whole
are
determined
in
the
last
resort
by
this
consciousness
and
not
by
the
thought
of
the
individual
–
and
these
actions
can
be
understood
only
by
reference
to
this
consciousness
.



this
analysis
establishes
right
from
the
start
the
distance
that
separates
class
consciousness
from
the
empirically
given
,
and
from
the
psychologically
describable
and
explicable
ideas
which
men
form
about
their
situation
in
life
.


but
it
is
not
enough
just
to
state
that
this
---------------
produce
qualitative
distinctions
.


and
we
must
discover
,
secondly
,
the
practical
significance
of
these
different
possible
relations
between
the
objective
economic
totality
,
the
imputed
class
consciousness
and
the
real
,
psychological
thoughts
of
men
about
their
lives
.


we
must
discover
,
in
short
,
the
practical
,
historical
function
of
class
consciousness
.



only
after
such
preparatory
formulations
can
we
begin
to
exploit
the
---------------
for
them
by
the
economic
structure
of
society
and
establishing
their
position
in
it
.


^
(
[12
]
)
regarded
abstractly
and
formally
,
then
,
class
consciousness
implies
a
class-conditioned
unconsciousness
of
ones
own
socio-historical
and
economic
condition
.


^
(
[13
]
)
this
condition
is
given
as
a
definite
structural
relation
,
a
definite
formal
nexus
which
appears
---------------

for
a
class
to
be
ripe
for
hegemony
means
that
its
interests
and
consciousness
enable
it
to
organise
the
whole
of
society
in
accordance
with
those
interests
.


the
crucial
question
in
every
class
struggle
is
this
:
which
class
possesses
this
capacity
and
this
consciousness
at
the
decisive
moment
?


this
does
not
preclude
the
use
of
force
.


it
does
not
mean
that
the
class-interests
destined
to
prevail
and
thus
to
uphold
the
---------------
about
by
the
most
ruthless
use
of
force
(as
e
.

g
.


the
primitive
accumulation
of
capital
)
.


but
it
often
turns
out
that
questions
of
class
consciousness
prove
to
be
decisive
in
just
those
situations
where
force
is
unavoidable
and
where
classes
are
locked
in
a
life-and-death-struggle
.


thus
the
noted
hungarian
marxist
erwin
szabo
is
---------------
the
peasants’
revolt
was
suppressed
only
by
the
ruthless
use
of
force
and
that
its
defeat
was
not
grounded
in
socioeconomic
factors
and
in
the
class
consciousness
of
the
peasants
.


he
overlooks
the
fact
that
the
deepest
reason
for
the
weakness
of
the
peasantry
and
the
superior
strength
of
the
princes
is
to
be
sought
in
class
consciousness
.


even
the
most
cursory
student
of
the
military
aspects
of
the
peasants’
war
can
easily
convince
himself
of
this
.



it
must
not
be
thought
,
however
,
that
all
classes
ripe
for
hegemony
have
a
class
consciousness
with
the
same
inner
structure
.


everything
hinges
on
the
extent
to
which
they
can
become
conscious
of
the
actions
they
need
to
perform
in
order
to
obtain
and
organise
power
.


the
question
then
becomes
:
how
far
does
the
class
concerned
perform
the
actions
history
has
imposed
on
it
‘consciously’
or
‘unconsciously’
?


and
is
that
consciousness
‘true’
or
‘false’
.


these
distinctions
are
by
no
means
academic
.


quite
apart
from
problems
of
culture
where
such
fissures
and
dissonances
are
crucial
,
in
all
practical
matters
too
the
fate
of
a
class
depends
on
its
ability
to
elucidate
and
solve
the
problems
with
which
history
confronts
it
.


and
here
it
becomes
transparently
obvious
that
class
consciousness
is
concerned
neither
with
the
thoughts
of
individuals
,
however
advanced
,
nor
with
the
state
of
scientific
knowledge
.


for
example
,
it
is
quite
clear
that
ancient
society
was
---------------
a
class
standpoint
other
than
that
of
the
bourgeoisie
.


and
no
class
can
do
that
–
unless
it
is
willing
to
abdicate
its
power
freely
.


thus
the
barrier
which
converts
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
into
‘false’
consciousness
is
objective
;
it
is
the
class
situation
itself
.


it
is
the
objective
result
of
the
economic
set-up
,
and
is
neither
arbitrary
,
subjective
nor
psychological
.


the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
may
well
be
able
to
reflect
all
the
problems
of
organisation
entailed
by
its
hegemony
and
by
the
capitalist
transformation
and
---------------
feudalism
or
even
the
mercantilism
of
the
transitional
period
,
but
by
an
internal
dialectical
twist
they
became
“natural
laws
based
on
the
unconsciousness
of
those
who
are
involved
in
them”
.

it
would
be
beyond
the
scope
of
these
pages
to
advance
further
and
attempt
to
construct
a
historical
and
systematic
typology
of
the
possible
degrees
of
class
consciousness
.


that
would
require
–
in
the
first
instance
–
an
exact
study
of
the
point
in
the
total
process
of
production
at
which
the
interests
of
the
various
classes
are
most
---------------
totality
that
is
then
achieved
?


how
far
does
it
really
embrace
the
true
totality
of
production
?


it
is
quite
evident
that
the
quality
and
structure
of
class
consciousness
must
be
very
different
if
,
e
.

g
.


it
remains
stationary
at
the
separation
of
consumption
from
production
(as
with
the
roman
lumpenproletariat
)
or
if
it
represents
the
formation
of
---------------
cannot
embark
on
a
systematic
typology
of
the
various
points
of
view
it
can
be
seen
from
the
foregoing
that
these
specimens
of
‘false’
consciousness
differ
from
each
other
both
qualitatively
,
structurally
and
in
a
manner
that
is
crucial
for
the
activity
of
the
classes
in
society
.


---------------
it
follows
from
the
above
that
for
pre-capitalist
epochs
and
for
the
behaviour
of
many
strata
within
capitalism
whose
economic
roots
lie
in
pre-capitalism
,
class
consciousness
is
unable
to
achieve
complete
clarity
and
to
influence
the
course
of
history
consciously
.



---------------
only
question
that
arises
is
whether
this
unity
enables
the
individual
sectors
of
society
to
relate
to
society
as
a
whole
in
such
a
way
that
their
imputed
consciousness
can
assume
an
economic
form
.


marx
emphasises

^
(
[19
]
)
that
in
greece
and
rome
the
class
struggle
“chiefly
took
the
form
of
a
conflict
between
debtors
and
creditors”
.


but
he
also
makes
the
---------------
despite
this
conflict
between
juridical
form
and
economic
content
,
the
juridical
(privilege-creating
)
forms
retain
a
great
and
often
absolutely
crucial
importance
for
the
consciousness
of
estates
in
the
process
of
disintegration
.


for
the
form
of
the
estates
conceals
the
connection
between
the
–
real
but
‘unconscious’
–
economic
existence
of
the
estate
and
the
economic
totality
of
society
.


it
fixates
consciousness
directly
on
its
privileges
(as
in
the
case
of
the
knights
during
the
reformation
)
or
else
–
no
less
directly
–
on
the
particular
element
of
society
from
---------------
absorbed
economically
into
a
number
of
different
classes
,
it
still
retains
this
(objectively
unreal
)
ideological
coherence
.


for
the
relation
to
the
whole
created
by
the
consciousness
of
one’s
status
is
not
directed
to
the
real
,
living
economic
unity
but
to
a
past
state
of
society
as
constituted
by
the
privileges
accorded
to
the
estates
.


status
–
consciousness
–
a
real
historical
factor
masks
class
consciousness
;
in
fact
it
prevents
it
from
emerging
at
all
.


a
like
phenomenon
can
be
observed
under
capitalism
in
the
case
of
all
‘privileged’
groups
whose
---------------
control
(as
was
the
case
with
the
great
landowners
)
.



thus
class
consciousness
has
quite
a
different
relation
to
history
in
pre-capitalist
and
capitalist
periods
.


in
the
former
case
the
classes
could
only
be
deduced
from
the
immediately
given
historical
reality
by
---------------
its
starkness
as
the
motor
of
history
.


in
pre-capitalist
periods
man
could
never
become
conscious
(not
even
by
virtue
of
an
‘imputed’
consciousness
)
of
the
“true
driving
forces
which
stand
behind
the
motives
of
human
actions
in
history”
.


they
remained
hidden
behind
motives
and
were
in
truth
the
blind
forces
of
history
.


ideological
---------------

but
there
is
still
an
unbridgeable
gulf
between
this
and
capitalism
where
economic
factors
are
not
concealed
‘behind’
consciousness
but
are
present
in
consciousness
itself
(albeit
unconsciously
or
repressed
)
.


with
capitalism
,
with
the
abolition
of
the
feudal
estates
and
with
the
creation
of
a
society
with
a
purely
economic
articulation
,
class
consciousness
arrived
at
the
point
where
it
could
become
conscious
.


from
then
on
social
conflict
was
reflected
in
an
ideological
struggle
for
consciousness
and
for
the
veiling
or
the
exposure
of
the
class
character
of
society
.


but
the
fact
that
this
conflict
became
possible
points
forward
to
the
dialectical
contradictions
and
the
internal
dissolution
---------------
of
society
rather
than
on
the
construction
of
society
as
a
whole
.



the
question
of
consciousness
may
make
its
appearance
in
terms
of
the
objectives
chosen
or
in
terms
of
action
,
as
for
instance
in
the
case
of
the
petty
bourgeoisie
.


this
class
lives
at
least
in
part
in
the
---------------
it
into
harmony”
.


^
(
[25
]
)
in
all
decisions
crucial
for
society
its
actions
will
be
irrelevant
and
it
will
be
forced
to
fight
for
both
sides
in
turn
but
always
without
consciousness
.


in
so
doing
its
own
objectives
–
which
exist
exclusively
in
its
own
consciousness
–
must
become
progressively
weakened
and
increasingly
divorced
from
social
action
.


ultimately
they
will
assume
purely
‘ideological’
forms
the
petty
---------------
of
1789
or
the
russian
revolution
of
1917
)
,
or
reactionary
(as
with
napoleon’s
coup
d’état
)
will
depend
on
the
position
of
the
other
classes
involved
in
the
conflict
,
and
on
the
level
of
consciousness
of
the
parties
that
lead
them
.


for
this
reason
,
too
,
the
ideological
form
taken
by
the
class
consciousness
of
the
peasants
changes
its
content
more
frequently
than
that
of
other
classes
:
this
is
because
it
is
always
borrowed
from
elsewhere
.



hence
parties
that
base
themselves
wholly
or
in
part
on
this
class
consciousness
always
lack
really
firm
and
secure
support
in
critical
situations
(as
was
true
of
the
socialist
revolutionaries
in
1917
and
1918
)
.


this
explains
why
it
is
possible
for
peasant
conflicts
to
be
fought
out
under
opposing
flags
.


thus
it
is
highly
characteristic
of
both
anarchism
and
the
‘class
consciousness
of
the
peasantry
that
a
number
of
counter-revolutionary
rebellions
and
uprisings
of
the
middle
and
upper
strata
of
the
peasantry
in
russia
should
have
found
the
anarchist
view
of
society
to
be
a
satisfying
ideology
.


we
cannot
really
speak
of
class
consciousness
in
the
case
of
these
classes
(if
,
indeed
,
we
can
,
even
speak
of
them
as
classes
in
the
strict
marxist
sense
of
the
term
)
:
for
a
full
consciousness
of
their
situation
would
reveal
to
them
the
hopelessness
of
their
particularise
strivings
in
the
face
of
the
inevitable
course
of
events
.


consciousness
and
self-interest
then
are
mutually
incompatible
in
this
instance
.


and
as
class
consciousness
was
defined
in
terms
of
the
problems
of
imputing
class
interests
the
failure
of
their
class
consciousness
to
develop
in
the
immediately
given
historical
reality
becomes
comprehensible
philosophically
.



with
the
bourgeoisie
,
also
,
class
consciousness
stands
in
opposition
to
class
interest
.


but
here
the
antagonism
is
not
contradictory
but
dialectical
.


---------------
the
distinction
between
the
two
modes
of
contradiction
may
be
briefly
described
in
this
way
:
in
the
case
of
the
other
classes
,
a
class
consciousness
is
prevented
from
emerging
by
their
position
within
the
process
of
production
and
the
interests
this
generates
.


in
the
case
of
the
bourgeoisie
,
however
,
these
factors
combine
to
produce
a
class
consciousness
but
one
which
is
cursed
by
its
very
nature
with
the
tragic
fate
of
developing
an
insoluble
contradiction
at
the
very
zenith
of
its
powers
.


as
a
result
of
this
contradiction
it
must
annihilate
itself
.


---------------
into
a
new
repressiveness
.


sociologically
,
the
bourgeoisie
did
everything
in
its
power
to
eradicate
the
fact
of
class
conflict
from
the
consciousness
of
society
,
even
though
class
conflict
had
only
emerged
in
its
purity
and
became
established
as
an
historical
fact
with
the
advent
of
capitalism
.


ideologically
,
we
see
the
same
contradiction
in
the
fact
---------------
all
these
contradictions
,
and
the
list
might
be
extended
indefinitely
,
are
only
the
reflection
of
the
deepest
contradictions
in
capitalism
itself
as
they
appear
in
the
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
in
accordance
with
their
position
in
the
total
system
of
production
.


for
this
reason
they
appear
as
dialectical
contradictions
in
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
.


they
do
not
merely
reflect
the
inability
of
the
bourgeoisie
to
grasp
the
contradictions
inherent
in
its
own
social
order
.


for
,
on
the
one
hand
,
capitalism
is
the
first
system
---------------

^
(
[27
]
)
and
this
implies
that
in
theory
the
bourgeoisie
should
be
able
to
progress
from
this
central
point
to
the
possession
of
an
(imputed
)
class
consciousness
of
the
whole
system
of
production
.


on
the
other
hand
,
the
position
held
by
the
capitalist
class
and
the
interests
which
determine
its
actions
ensure
that
it
will
be
unable
to
control
its
own
---------------
there
are
many
reasons
for
this
.


in
the
first
place
,
it
only
seems
to
be
true
that
for
capitalism
production
occupies
the
centre
of
class
consciousness
and
hence
provides
the
theoretical
starting-point
for
analysis
.


with
reference
to
ricardo
“who
had
been
reproached
with
an
exclusive
concern
with
production”
,
marx
emphasised
^
(
[28
]
)
that
he
---------------
production
through
cartels
and
trusts
only
shifts
the
contradiction
elsewhere
,
without
,
however
,
eliminating
it
.


this
situation
forms
one
of
the
decisive
factors
governing
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
.


it
is
true
that
the
bourgeoisie
acts
as
a
class
in
the
objective
evolution
of
society
.


but
it
understands
the
process
(which
it
---------------
bafflement
felt
by
the
individual
capitalist
when
confronted
by
his
own
individual
fate
.


the
facts
and
the
situations
which
induce
this
panic
force
something
into
the
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
which
is
too
much
of
a
brute
fact
for
its
existence
to
be
wholly
denied
or
repressed
.


but
equally
it
is
something
that
the
bourgeoisie
can
never
fully
---------------

in
this
way
the
objective
limits
of
capitalist
production
become
the
limits
of
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
.


the
older
‘natural’
and
‘conservative’
forms
of
domination
had
left
unmolested

^
(
[34
]
)
the
forms
of
production
of
whole
sections
of
the
people
they
---------------
ignorance
of
the
objective
economic
limitations
of
its
own
system
expresses
itself
as
an
internal
,
dialectical
contradiction
in
its
class
consciousness

this
means
that
formally
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
is
geared
to
economic
consciousness
.


and
indeed
the
highest
degree
of
unconsciousness
,
the
crassest
,
form
of
‘false
consciousness’
always
manifests
itself
when
the
conscious
mastery
of
economic
phenomena
appears
to
be
at
its
greatest
.


from
the
point
of
view
of
the
relation
of
consciousness
to
society
this
contradiction
is
expressed
as
the
irreconcilable
antagonism
between
ideology
and
economic
base
.


its
dialectics
are
grounded
in
the
irreconcilable
antagonism
between
the

(capitalist
)
individual
,
i
.

e
.


the
stereotyped
individual
of
capitalism
,
and
the
‘natural’
and
inevitable
process
of
development
,
i
.

e
.


the
process
not
subject
to
consciousness
.


in
consequence
theory
and
practice
are
brought
into
irreconcilable
opposition
to
each
other
.


but
the
resulting
dualism
is
anything
but
stable
;
in
fact
it
constantly
strives
---------------
disruption
.



this
internal
dialectical
contradiction
in
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
is
further
aggravated
by
the
fact
that
the
objective
limits
of
capitalism
do
not
remain
purely
negative
.


that
is
to
say
that
capitalism
does
not
merely
set
‘natural’
laws
in
motion
that
provoke
crises
which
it
cannot
comprehend
.


on
the
contrary
,
those
limits
acquire
a
historical
embodiment
with
its
own
consciousness
and
its
own
actions
:
the
proletariat
.



---------------
capitalism
,
the
bourgeoisie
was
thrown
back
increasingly
on
to
a
conscious
defensive
.


the
dialectical
contradiction
in
the
‘false’
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
became
more
and
more
acute
:
the
‘false’
consciousness
was
converted
into
a
mendacious
consciousness
.


what
had
been
at
first
an
objective
contradiction
now
became
subjective
also
:
the
theoretical
problem
turned
into
a
moral
posture
which
decisively
---------------

thus
the
situation
in
which
the
bourgeoisie
finds
itself
determines
the
function
of
its
class
consciousness
in
its
struggle
to
achieve
control
of
society
.


the
hegemony
of
the
bourgeoisie
really
does
embrace
the
whole
of
society
;
it
really
does
attempt
to
organise
the
whole
of
---------------
the
rule
of
a
minority
.


its
hegemony
is
exercised
not
merely
by
a
minority
but
in
the
interest
of
that
minority
,
so
the
need
to
deceive
the
other
classes
and
to
ensure
that
their
class
consciousness
remains
amorphous
is
inescapable
for
a
bourgeois
regime
.


(consider
here
the
theory
of
the
state
that
stands
‘above’
class
antagonisms
,
or
the
notion
---------------
‘essence’
of
history
and
the
state
.


but
in
vain
:
with
the
end
of
the
century
the
issue
was
resolved
by
the
advances
of
science
and
their
corresponding
effects
on
the
consciousness
of
the
capitalist
elite
.



this
can
be
seen
very
clearly
in
the
bourgeoisie’s
greater
readiness
to
---------------
with
current
attempts
to
harmonise
a
‘planned’
economy
with
the
class
interests
of
the
bourgeoisie
,
we
are
forced
to
admit
that
what
we
are
witnessing
is
the
capitulation
of
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
before
that
of
the
proletariat
.


of
course
the
section
of
the
bourgeoisie
that
accepts
the
notion
of
a
‘planned’
economy
does
not
mean
---------------
4

in
this
struggle
for
consciousness
historical
materialism
plays
a
crucial
role
.


ideologically
no
less
than
economically
,
the
bourgeoisie
and
the
proletariat
are
mutually
interdependent
.


the
same
process
that

of
society
a
power-factor
of
the
first
,
and
perhaps
decisive
importance
.



the
unique
function
of
consciousness
in
the
class
struggle
of
the
proletariat
has
consistently
been
overlooked
by
the
vulgar
marxists
who
have
substituted
a
petty
‘realpolitik’
for
the
great
battle
of
principle
---------------
social
change
.


when
the
vulgar
marxists
detach
themselves
from
this
central
point
of
view
,
i
.

e
.


from
the
point
where
a
proletarian
class
consciousness
arises
,
they
thereby
place
themselves
on
the
level
of
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
.


and
that
the
bourgeoisie
fighting
on
its
own
ground
will
prove
superior
to
the
proletariat
both
economically
and
ideologically
can
come
as
a
surprise
only
to
a
vulgar
marxist
.


---------------
its
ability
to
see
society
from
the
centre
as
a
coherent
whole
.


this
means
that
it
is
able
to
act
in
such
a
way
as
to
change
reality
;
in
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
theory
and
practice
coincide
and
so
it
can
consciously
throw
the
weight
of
its
actions
onto
the
scales
of
history
–
and
this
is
the
deciding
factor
.


when
the
vulgar
marxists
---------------
various
elements
of
the
process
they
had
hoped
to
master
.



the
class
consciousness
that
springs
from
this
position
must
exhibit
the
same
internal
structure
as
that
of
the
bourgeoisie
.


but
when
the
logic
of
events
drives
the
same
dialectical
contradictions
to
the
surface
of
consciousness
the
consequences
for
the
proletariat
are
even
more
disastrous
than
for
the
bourgeoisie
.


for
despite
all
the
dialectical
contradictions
,
despite
all
its
objective
falseness
,
the
self-deceiving
‘false’
consciousness
that
we
find
in
the
bourgeoisie
is
at
least
in
accord
with
its
class
situation
.


it
cannot
save
the
bourgeoisie
from
the
constant
exacerbation
of
these
contradictions
and
so
from
destruction
,
---------------
victories
,
albeit
of
short
duration
.



but
in
the
case
of
the
proletariat
such
a
consciousness
not
only
has
to
overcome
these
internal
(bourgeois
)
contradictions
,
but
it
also
conflicts
with
the
course
of
action
to
which
the
economic
situation
---------------
comes
to
it
1
s
goal
the
more
urgent
it
becomes
for
the
proletariat
to
understand
its
own
historical
mission
and
the
more
vigorously
and
directly
proletarian
class
consciousness
will
determine
each
of
its
actions
.


for
the
blind
power
of
the
forces
at
work
will
only
advance
‘automatically’
to
their
goal
of
self-annihilation
as
long
as
that
goal
---------------
capitalism
develops
,
the
fate
of
the
revolution
(and
with
it
the
fate
of
mankind
)
will
depend
on
the
ideological
maturity
of
the
proletariat
,
i
.

e
.


on
its
class
consciousness
.



we
have
now
determined
the
unique
function
of
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
in
contrast
to
that
of
other
classes
.


the
proletariat
cannot
liberate
itself
as
a
class
without
simultaneously
abolishing
class
society
as
such
.


for
that
reason
its
consciousness
,
the
last
class
consciousness
in
the
history
of
mankind
,
must
both
lay
bare
the
nature
of
society
and
achieve
an
increasingly
inward
fusion
of
theory
and
practice
.


‘ideology’
for
the
proletariat
is
no
banner
to
follow
into
---------------
the
level
of
mere
‘ideology’
and
forces
the
proletariat
to
use
bourgeois

(or
petty
bourgeois
)
tactics
.


it
thereby
robs
it
of
its
greatest
strength
by
forcing
class
consciousness
into
the
secondary
or
inhibiting
role
of
a
bourgeois
consciousness
,
instead
of
the
active
role
of
a
proletarian
consciousness
.



the
relationship
between
class
consciousness
and
class
situation
is
really
very
simple
in
the
case
of
the
proletariat
,
but
the
obstacles
which
prevent
its
consciousness
being
realised
in
practice
are
correspondingly
greater
.


in
the
first
place
this
consciousness
is
divided
within
itself
.


it
is
true
that
society
as
such
is
highly
unified
and
that
it
evolves
in
a
unified
manner
.


but
in
a
world
where
the
---------------
environment
it
looks
as
if
there
is
not
a
unity
but
a
diversity
of
mutually
independent
objects
and
forces
.


the
most
striking
division
in
proletarian
class
consciousness
and
the
one
most
fraught
with
consequences
is
the
separation
of
the
economic
struggle
from
the
political
one
.


marx
repeatedly
exposed
^
(
[37
]
)
the
fallacy
of
this
split
---------------
classes
that
successfully
carried
out
revolutions
in
earlier
societies
had
their
task
made
easier
subjective
by
this
very
fact
of
the
discrepancy
between
their
own
class
consciousness
and
the
objective
economic
set-up
,
i
.

e
.


by
their
very
unawareness
of
their
own
function
in
the
process
of
change
.


they
had
only
to
use
the
power
at
their
disposal
---------------

but
as
the
proletariat
has
been
entrusted
by
history
with
the
task
of
transforming
social
consciously
,
its
class
consciousness
must
develop
a
dialectical
contradiction
between
its
immediate
interests
and
its
long-term
objectives
,
and
between
the
discrete
factors
and
the
whole
.


---------------
consciously
beyond
the
confines
of
capitalist
society
.



this
means
that
subjectively
,
i
.

e
.


for
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
,
the
dialectical
relationship
between
immediate
interests
and
objective
impact
on
the
whole
of
society
is
loc
in
the
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
itself
.


it
does
not
work
itself
out
as
a
purely
objective
process
quite
apart
from
all
(imputed
)
consciousness
–
as
was
the
case
with
all
classes
hitherto
.


thus
the
revolutionary
victory
of
the
proletariat
does
not
imply
,
as
with
former
classes
,
the
immediate
---------------

this
inner
dialectic
makes
it
hard
for
the
proletariat
to
develop
its
class
consciousness
in
opposition
to
that
of
the
bourgeoisie
which
by
cultivating
the
crudest
and
most
abstract
kind
of
empiricism
was
able
to
make
do
with
a
superficial
view
of
the
world
.


whereas

his
observations
on
the
weavers’
uprising
in
silesia

)
^
(
[38
]
)
for
because
of
its
situation
this
contradiction
is
introduced
directly
into
the
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
,
whereas
the
bourgeoisie
,
from
its
situation
,
saw
the
contradictions
confronting
it
as
the
outer
limits
of
its
consciousness
.



conversely
,
this
contradiction
means
that
‘false’
consciousness
is
something
very
different
for
the
proletariat
than
for
every
preceding
class
.


even
correct
statements
about
particular
situations
or
aspects
of
the
development
of
bourgeois
class
consciousness
reveal
,
when
related
to
the
whole
of
society
,
the
limits
of
that
consciousness
and
unmask
its
‘falseness’
.


whereas
the
proletariat
always
aspires
towards
the
truth
even
in
its
‘false’
consciousness
and
in
its
substantive
errors
.


it
is
sufficient
here
to
recall
the
social
criticism
of
the
utopians
or
the
proletarian
and
revolutionary
extension
of
ricardo’s
theory
.


concerning
---------------

only
with
the
aid
of
this
distinction
can
there
be
any
resolution
of
the
contradiction
in
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
;
only
with
its
aid
can
that
contradiction
become
a
conscious
f
actor
in
history
.


for
the
objective
aspiration
towards
truth
which
is
immanent
even
in
the
‘false’
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
does
not
at
all
imply
that
this
aspiration
can
come
to
light
without
the
active
intervention
of
the
proletariat
.


on
the
contrary
,
the
mere
aspiration
towards
truth
can
only
strip
off
the
veils
of
falseness
and
mature
into
historically
significant
and
socially
revolutionary
knowledge
by
the
potentiating
of
consciousness
,
by
conscious
action
and
conscious
self-criticism
.


such
knowledge
would
of
course
be
unattainable
were
it
not
for
the
objective
aspiration
,
and
here
we
find
confirmation
of
marx’s
dictum
that
mankind
---------------
the
fruit
of
the
conscious
deeds
of
the
proletariat
.



the
dialectical
cleavage
in
the
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
is
a
product
of
the
same
structure
that
makes
the
historical
mission
of
the
proletariat
possible
by
pointing
forward
and
beyond
the
existing
social
---------------
the
class’s
self-interest
and
that
of
society
,
between
individual
deed
and
social
consequences
.


this
antagonism
set
an
external
limit
to
consciousness
.


here
,
in
the
centre
of
proletarian
class
consciousness
we
discover
an
antagonism
between
momentary
interest
and
ultimate
goal
.


the
outward
victory
of
the
proletariat
can
only
be
achieved
if
this
---------------

as
we
stressed
in
the
motto
to
this
essay
the
existence
of
this
conflict
enables
us
to
perceive
that
class
consciousness
is
identical
with
neither
the
psychological
consciousness
of
individual
members
of
the
proletariat
,
nor
with
the
(mass-psychological
)
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
as
a
whole
;
but
it
is
,
on
the
contrary
,
the
sense
,
become
conscious
,
of
the
historical
role
of
the
class
.


this
sense
will
---------------
may
have
either
of
two
functions
:
either
it
will
be
a
step
towards
the
ultimate
goal
or
else
it
will
conceal
it
.


which
of
the
two
it
will
be
depends
entirely
upon
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
and
not
on
victory
or
defeat
in
isolated
skirmishes
.


marx
drew
attention
very
early
on
^
(
[41
]
)
to
this
danger
,
which
is
particularly
acute
on
the
---------------
struggle
to
achieve
it
as
a
means
of
education
for
the
final
battle
whose
outcome
depends
on
closing
the
gap
between
the
psychological
consciousness
and
the
imputed
one
.


instead
it
regards
the
particular
as
a
valuable
achievement
in
itself
or
at
least
as
a
step
along
the
path
towards
the
ultimate
goal
.


in
a
word
,
opportunism
mistakes
the
actual
,
psychological
state
0
consciousness
of
proletarians
for
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
.



the
practical
damage
resulting
from
this
confusion
can
be
seen
in
the
great
loss
of
unity
and
cohesiveness
in
proletarian
praxis
when
compared
to
the
unity
of
the
objective
economic
tendencies
.


the
superior
strength
of
true
,
practical
class
consciousness
lies
in
the
ability
to
look
beyond
the
divisive
symptoms
of
the
economic
process
to
the
unity
of
the
total
social
system
underlying
it
.


in
the
age
of
capitalism

form

‘political’

,
and
even
if
in
consequence
the
reflex
of
the
crisis
is
fragmented
in
the
immediate
psychological
consciousness
of
the
workers
,
it
is
still
possible
and
necessary
to
advance
beyond
this
consciousness

to
be
a
necessity

and
larger
sections
of

until
the
crisis
became
acute

it
adopts
a
course

it

its
aim
now
is
to
scotch
the
development
of
proletarian
class
consciousness
in
its
progress
from
that
which
is
merely
given
to
that
which
conforms
to
the
objective
total
process
;
even
more
,
it
hopes
to
reduce
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
to
the
level
of
the
psychologically
given
and
thus
to
divert
into
the
opposite
direction
what
had
hitherto
been
the
purely
instinctive
tendency
.


as
long
as
the
unification
of
proletarian
class
consciousness
was
not
a
practical
possibility
this
theory
could
–
with
some
charity
–
be
regarded
as
a
mere
error
.


but
in
this
situation
it
takes
on
the
---------------
right
instincts
of
the
proletariat
it
plays
the
same
role
as
that
played
hitherto
by
capitalist
theory
:
it
denounces
the
correct
view
of
the
overall
economic
situation
and
the
correct
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
together
with
its
organised
form
,
the
communist
party
,
as
something
unreal
and
inimical
to
the
‘true’
interests
of
the
workers

(i
.

e
.


their
immediate
,
national
or
professional
interests
)
and
as
something
alien
to
their
‘genuine’
class
consciousness
(i
.

e
.


that
which
is
psychologically
given
)
.



to
say
that
class
consciousness
has
no
psychological
reality
does
not
imply
that
it
is
a
mere
fiction
.


its
reality
is
vouched
for
by
its
ability
to
explain
the
infinitely
painful
path
of
the
proletarian
---------------
the
celebrated
passage
in
the
eighteenth
brumaire
.



only
the
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
can
point
to
the
way
that
leads
out
of
the
impasse
of
capitalism
.


as
long
as
this
consciousness
is
lacking
,
the
crisis
remains
permanent
,
it
goes
back
to
its
starting-point
,
repeats
the
cycle
until
after
infinite
sufferings
and
---------------
is
to
say
,
the
class
struggle
must
be
raised
from
the
level
of
economic
necessity
to
the
level
of
conscious
aim
and
effective
class
consciousness
.


the
pacifists
and
humanitarians
of
the
class
struggle
whose
efforts
tend
whether
they
will
or
no
to
retard
this
lengthy
,
painful
and
crisis-ridden
process
would
be
horrified
if
they
could
but
---------------
the
only
question
at
issue
is
how
much
it
has
to
suffer
before
it
achieves
ideological
maturity
,
before
it
acquires
a
true
understanding
of
its
class
situation
and
a
true
class
consciousness
.



of
course
this
uncertainty
and
lack
of
clarity
are
themselves
the
---------------
criticism
and
the
negation
of
this
form
of
life
.


but
until
the
objective
crisis
of
capitalism
has
matured
and
until
the
proletariat
has
achieved
true
class
consciousness
,
and
the
ability
to
understand
the
crisis
fully
,
it
cannot
go
beyond
the
criticism
of
reification
and
so
it
is
only
negatively
superior
to
its
antagonist
.


indeed
,
if
it
can
do
no
more
---------------
unionists
.


such
criticism
from
the
standpoint
of
capitalism
can
be
seen
most
strikingly
in
the
separation
of
the
various
theatres
of
war
.


the
bare
fact
of
separation
itself
indicates
that
the
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
is
still
fettered
by
reification
.


and
if
the
proletariat
finds
the
economic
inhumanity
to
which
it
is
subjected
easier
to
---------------
unconquered
power
of
capitalist
forms
of
life
in
the
proletariat
itself
.



the
reified
consciousness
must
also
remain
hopelessly
trapped
in
the
two
extremes
of
crude
empiricism
and
abstract
utopianism
.


in
the
one
case
,
consciousness
becomes
either
a
completely
passive
observer
moving
in
obedience
to
laws
which
it
can
never
control
.


in
the
other
it
regards
itself
as
a
power
which
is
able
of
its
own
–
subjective
–
volition
to
master
the
essentially
meaningless
motion
of
objects
.


we
have
already
identified
the
crude
empiricism
of
the
opportunists
in
its
relation
to
proletarian
class
consciousness
.


we
must
now
go
on
to
see
utopianism
as
characteristic
of
the
internal
divisions
within
class
consciousness
.



(the
separation
of
empiricism
from
utopianism
undertaken
here
for
purely
methodological
reasons
should
not
be
taken
as
an
admission
that
the
two
---------------

the
philosophical
efforts
of
the
young
marx
were
largely
directed
towards
the
refutation
of
the
various
false
theories
of
consciousness

(including
both
the
‘idealism’
of
the
hegelian
school
and
the
‘materialism’
of
feuerbach
)
and
towards
the
discovery
of
a
correct
view
of
the
role
of
consciousness
in
history
.


as
early
as
the
correspondence
of
1843
[with
ruge
]
he
conceives
of
consciousness
as
immanent
in
history
.


consciousness
does
not
lie
outside
the
real
process
of
history
.


it
does
not
have
to
be
introduced
into
the
world
by
philosophers
;
therefore
to
gaze
down
arrogantly
upon
the
petty
struggles
of
the
world
and
to
despise
them
is
indefensible
.


“we
only
show
it
[the
world
]
what
its
struggles
are
about
and
consciousness
is
a
thing
that
it
must
needs
acquire
whether
it
will
or
not
.

”
what
is
needed
then
is
only
“to
explain
its
own
actions
to
it”
.


^
(
[44
]
)
the
great
polemic
against
hegel
in
the
holy
family
concentrates
mainly
on
this
point
.


^
(
[45
]
)
,
hegel’s
inadequacy
is
that
he
only
seems
to
allow
the
absolute
spirit
to
make
history
.


the
resulting
otherworldliness
of
consciousness
vis-à-vis
the
real
events
of
history
becomes
,
in
the
hands
of
hegel’s
disciples
,
an
arrogant
–
and
reactionary
confrontation
of
‘spirit’
and
‘mass’
.


marx
---------------

complementing
this
is
his
–
aphoristic
–
critique
of
feuerbach
.


the
materialists
had
elaborated
a
view
of
consciousness
as
of
something
appertaining
to
this
world
.


marx
sees
it
as
merely
one
stage
in
the
process
,
the
stage
of
‘bourgeois
society’
.


he
opposes
to
it
the
notion
of
consciousness
as
‘practical
critical
activity’
with
the
task
of
‘changing
the
world’
.



this
provides
us
with
the
philosophical
foundation
we
need
to
settle
accounts
with
the
utopians
.


for
their
thought
contains
this
very
duality
of
social
process
and
the
consciousness
of
it
.


consciousness
approaches
society
from
another
world
and
leads
it
from
.


the
false
path
it
has
followed
back
to
the
right
one
.


the
utopians
are
prevented
by
the
---------------
bearer
of
historical
movement
in
history
itself
,
in
the
way
the
proletariat
organises
itself
as
a
class
and
,
hence
,
in
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
.


they
are
not
yet
able
to
“take
note
of
what
is
happening
before
their
very
eyes
and
to
become
its
mouthpiece”
.



^
(
[46
]
)
---------------
means
that
utopianism
can
be
dismissed
as
a
factor
in
the
proletariat’s
struggle
for
freedom
.


this
is
true
only
for
those
stages
of
class
consciousness
that
have
really
achieved
the
unity
of
theory
and
practice
described
by
marx
,
the
real
and
practical
intervention
of
class
consciousness
in
the
course
of
history
and
hence
the
practical
understanding
of
reification
.


and
this
did
not
all
happen
at
a
single
stroke
and
in
a
coherent
manner
.


for
there
are
not
merely
national
and
‘social’
stages
involved
but
there
are
also
gradations
within
the
class
consciousness
of
workers
in
the
same
strata
.


the
separation
of
economics
from
politics
is
the
most
revealing
and
also
the
most
important
instance
of
this
.


it
appears
that
some
sections
of
the
proletariat
have
quite
the
right
instincts
as
far
as
the
economic
struggle
goes
and
can
even
raise
them
to
the
level
of
class
consciousness
.


at
the
same
time
,
‘however
,
when
it
comes
to
political
questions
they
manage
to
persist
in
a
completely
utopian
point
of
view
.


it
does
not
need
to
be
emphasised
that
---------------
not
yet
possible
to
see
society
;is
a
whole
.


this
can
be
seen
at
its
clearest
in
purely
ideological
questions
,
in
questions
of
culture
.


these
questions
occupy
an
almost
wholly
isolated
position
in
the
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
;
the
organic
bonds
connecting
these
issues
with
the
immediate
life-interests
of
the
proletariat
as
well
as
with
society
as
a
whole
have
not
even
begun
to
penetrate
its
consciousness
.


the
achievement
in
this
area
hardly
ever
goes
beyond
the
self-criticism
of
capitalism
–
carried
out
here
by
the
proletariat
.


what
is
positive
here
---------------

these
gradations
are
,
then
,
on
the
one
hand
,
objective
historical
necessities
,
nuances
in
the
objective
possibilities
of
consciousness

(such
as
the
relative
cohesiveness
of
politics
and
economics
in
comparison
to
cultural
questions
)
.


on
the
other
hand
,
where
consciousness
already
exists
as
an
objective
possibility
,
they
indicate
degrees
of
distance
between
the
psychological
class
consciousness
and
the
adequate
understanding
of
the
total
situation
.


these
gradations
,
however
,
can
no
longer
be
referred
back
to
socioeconomic
causes
.


the
objective
theory
of
class
consciousness
is
the
theory
of
its
objective
possibility
.


the
stratification
of
the
problems
and
economic
interests
within
the
proletariat
is
,
unfortunately
,
almost
wholly
unexplored
,
but
---------------
various
strata
,
we
would
still
be
confronted
at
every
turn
with
the
problem
of
whether
it
is
actually
possible
to
make
the
objective
possibility
of
class
consciousness
into
a
reality
.


hitherto
this
question
could
only
occur
to
extraordinary
individuals
(consider
marx’s
completely
non-utopian
prescience
with
regard
to
the
problems
of
---------------
in
an
increasingly
radical
and
conscious
manner
.


when
this
weapon
increases
in
power
to
the
point
where
it
becomes
the
organ
of
state
,
this
is
a
sign
that
the
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
is
on
the
verge
of
overcoming
the
bourgeois
outlook
of
its
leaders
.



the
revolutionary
workers’
council
(not
to
be
confused
with
its
opportunist
caricatures
)
is
one
of
the
forms
which
the
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
has
striven
to
create
ever
since
its
inception
.


the
fact
that
it
exists
and
is
constantly
developing
shows
that
the
proletariat
already
stands
on
the
threshold
of
its
own
consciousness
and
hence
on
the
threshold
of
victory
.


the
workers’
council
spells
the
political
and
economic
defeat
of
reification
.


in
the
period
following
the
dictatorship
---------------

thus
we
must
never
overlook
the
distance
that
separates
the
consciousness
of
even
the
most
revolutionary
worker
from
the
authentic
class
consciousness
of
the
proletariat
.


but
even
this
situation
can
be
explained
on
the
basis
of
the
marxist
theory
of
class
struggle
and
class
consciousness
.


the
proletariat
only
perfects
itself
by
annihilating
and
transcending
itself
,
by
creating
the
classless
society
through
the
successful
conclusion
of
its
own
class
struggle
.


the
struggle
for
this
---------------
it
is
equally
the
struggle
of
the
proletariat
against
itself
.


against
the
devastating
and
degrading
effects
of
the
capitalist
system
upon
its
class
consciousness
.


the
proletariat
will
only
have
won
the
real
victory
when
it
has
overcome
these
effects
within
itself
.


the
separation
of
the
areas
that
should
be
united
,
the
diverse
stages
of
consciousness
which
the
proletariat
has
reached
in
the
various
spheres
of
activity
are
a
precise
index
of
what
has
been
achieved
and
what
remains
to
be
done
.


the
---------------
economic
self-contradiction
of
any
purely
capitalist
society
is
undoubtedly
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
contradictions
in
the
class
consciousness
of
the
bourgeoisie
.

in
the
field
of
cognitive
neuroscience
,
metacognitive
monitoring
and
control
have
been
viewed
as
functions
of
the
prefrontal
cortex
,
which
receives
sensory
input
signals
from
divergent
cortical
regions
and
implements
control
through
feedback
loops
which
are
established
utilizing
the
underlying
mechanisms
of
neuroplasticity

when
documenting
your
patient’s
level
of
consciousness
,
you’ll
notice
you
have
a
lot
of
options
to
choose
from
.


your
patient
can
be
alert
,
confused
,
in
a
coma
and
anything
in
between
.


knowing
the
difference
between
each
level
of
consciousness
will
help
you
chart
accurately
and
communicate
your
patient’s
condition
with
precision
.


the
different
levels
of
consciousness
are
:

-
alert
:
awake
and
responsive
---------------
unresponsive
,
requiring
immediate
intervention
in
order
to
keep
the
patient
safe
.


had
i
not
known
how
to
describe
this
patient’s
level
of
consciousness
using
standardized
language
,
there
could
have
been
a
huge
miscommunication
between
me
and
the
md
.


so
,
let’s
go
through
a
quick
example
using
an
entirely
fictitious
patient
.


ready
?


---------------
all
morning
,
and
you
have
both
ensured
that
the
appropriate
interventions
have
been
instituted
.


in
a
case
with
patient
with
renal
disease
,
you
will
often
see
them
have
decreasing
levels
of
consciousness
as
their
ph
drops
secondary
to
their
metabolic
acidosis
.


with
a
patient
like
this
,
you
might
anticipate
the
md
ordering
an
abg
at
some
---------------
telemetry
unit
.



this
whole
topic
of
consciousness
is
so
incredibly
interesting
,
especially
as
it
relates
to
anesthesia
.

waking
state

animals

men
and
their
condition
when
asleep
,
in
a
coma
,
or
under
anesthesia
(the
latter
condition
was
described
as
unconsciousness
)
.


other
descriptions
included
an
analysis
of
consciousness
as
a
form
of
relationship
or
act
of
the
mind
toward
objects
in
nature
,
and
a
view
that
consciousness
was
a
continuous
field

stream
of
essentially
mental
“sense
data

roughly
similar
to
the
“ideas”

earlier

more
from

nervous
system
disease
:
altered
consciousness

the
method
employed
by
most
early
writers
in
observing
consciousness
was
introspection—looking
within
one’s
own
mind
to
discover
the
laws
of
its
operation
.


the
limitations
of
the
method
became
apparent
when
it
was
---------------
in
behaviourist
psychology
,
derived
primarily
from
work
of
the
american
psychologist
john
b
.


watson
in
the
early
1900s
,
the
concept
of
consciousness
was
irrelevant
to
the
objective
investigation
of
human
behaviour
and
was
doctrinally
ignored
in
research
.


neobehaviourists
,
however
,
adopted
a
more
liberal
posture
toward
mentalistic
states
such
as
consciousness
.



neurophysiological
mechanisms

that
consciousness
depends
on
the
function
of
the
brain
has
been
known
from
ancient
times
.


although
detailed
understanding
of
the
neural
mechanisms
of
consciousness
has
not
been
achieved
,
correlations
between
states
of
consciousness
and
functions
of
the
brain
are
possible
.


levels
of
consciousness
in
terms
of
levels
of
alertness
or
responsiveness
are
correlated
with
patterns
of
electrical
activity
of
the
brain
(brain
waves
)
recorded
by
an
electroencephalograph

brain
waves
consists
of
rapid
irregular
waves
of
low
amplitude
or
voltage
.


in
contrast
,
during
sleep
,
when
consciousness
can
be
said
to
be
minimal
,
the
brain
waves
are
much
slower
and
of
greater
amplitude
,
often
coming
in
periodic
bursts
of
slow
waxing
and
waning
amplitude
.



both
behavioral
levels
of
consciousness
and
the
correlated
patterns
of
electrical
activity
are
related
to
the
function
of
a
part
of
the
brainstem
called
the
reticular
formation
.


electrical
stimulation
of
the
ascending
reticular
systems
arouses
a
sleeping
cat
to
alert
consciousness
and
simultaneously
activates
its
brain
waves
to
the
waking
pattern
.



---------------

it
was
once
supposed
that
the
neurophysiological
mechanisms
subserving
consciousness
and
the
higher
mental
processes
must
reside
in
the
cortex
.


it
is
more
likely
,
however
,
that
the
cortex
serves
the
more
specialized
functions
of
integrating
patterns
of
sensory
experience
and
organizing
motor
patterns
and
that
the
ascending
reticular
system
represents
the
neural
structures
most
critically
related
to
consciousness
.


the
brainstem
reticular
formation
should
not
,
however
,
be
called
the
seat
of
consciousness
.


it
represents
an
integrative
focus
,
functioning
through
its
widespread
interconnections
with
the
cortex
and
other
regions
of
the
brain

false
consciousness
,
in
philosophy
,
particularly
within
critical
theory
and
other
marxist
schools
and
movements
,
the
notion
that
members
of
the
proletariat
unwittingly
misperceive
their
real
position
in
society
and
systematically
misunderstand
their
genuine
interests
within
the
social
relations
of
production
under
capitalism
.


false
consciousness
denotes
people’s
inability
to
recognize
inequality
,
oppression
,
and
exploitation
in
a
capitalist
society
because
of
the
prevalence
within
it
of
views
that
naturalize
and
legitimize
the
existence
of
social
classes
.



despite
its
close
assocation
with
marxism
,
the
term
false
consciousness
was
never
used
by
karl
marx
.


the
first
treatment
of
false
consciousness
as
a
theoretical
concept
occurred
in
history
and
class
consciousness

(1923
)
by
the
hungarian
philosopher
and
literary
critic
györgy
lukács
.


the
concept
was
further
developed
in
the
20th

by

the
word
consciousness
is
used
in
a
variety
of
ways
that
need
to
be
distinguished
.


sometimes
the
word
means
merely
any
human
mental
activity
at
all
(as
when
one
talks
about
the
“history
of
consciousness”
)
,
and
sometimes
it
means
merely
being
awake
(as
in
as
the
anesthetic
wore
off
,
the
animal
regained
consciousness
)
.


the
most
philosophically
troublesome
usage
concerns
phenomena
with
which
people
seem
to
be
“directly
acquainted”—as
the
british
philosopher
bertrand
russell
(1872–1970
)
---------------

it
turns
out
to
be
surprisingly
difficult
to
say
much
about
consciousness
that
is
not
highly
controversial
.


initial
efforts
in
the
19th
century
to
approach
psychology
with
the
rigour
of
other
experimental
sciences
led
researchers
to
engage
in
careful
introspection
---------------
the
consequent
pitfalls
of
thinking
of
conscious
processes
as
the
central
subject
matter
of
psychology
.


while
it
can
seem
natural
to
think
that
all
mental
phenomena
are
accessible
to
consciousness
,
close
attention
to
the
full
range
of
cases
suggests
otherwise
.


the
austrian-born
british
philosopher
ludwig
wittgenstein
(1889–1951
)
was
---------------
in
a
related
vein
,
the
american
linguist
ray
jackendoff
proposed
that
one
is
never
directly
conscious
of
abstract
ideas
,
such
as
goodness
and
justice—they
are
not
items
in
the
stream
of
consciousness
.


at
best
,
one
is
aware
of
the
perceptual
qualities
one
might
associate
with
such
ideas—for
example
,
an
image
of
someone
acting
in
a
kindly
way
.


while
it
---------------

partly
out
of
frustration
with
introspectionism
,
psychologists
during
the
first
half
of
the
20th
century
tended
to
ignore
consciousness
entirely
and
instead
study
only
“objective
behaviour”
(see
below
radical
behaviourism
)
.


in
the
last
decades
of
the
century
,
psychologists
began
to
turn
their
attention
once
again
to
consciousness
and
introspection
,
but
their
methods
differed
radically
from
those
of
early
introspectionists
,
in
ways
that
can
be
understood
against
the
background
---------------
all
.


if
a
person
does
not
have
immediate
knowledge
of
it
,
why
is
it
not
merely
part
of
the
purely
physical
machinery
of
the
brain
?


why
bring
in
mentality
at
all
?


accessibility
to
consciousness
,
however
,
is
not
the
only
criterion
for
determining
whether
a
given
state

is
mental

consciousness
can
be
defined
by
two
components
:
arousal
(wakefulness
)
and
awareness
(subjective
experience
)
.


however
,
neurophysiological
consciousness
metrics
able
to
disentangle
between
these
components
have
not
been
reported
.


here
,
we
propose
an
explainable
consciousness
indicator
(eci
)
using
deep
learning
to
disentangle
the
components
of
consciousness
.


we
employ
electroencephalographic
(eeg

responses
to
transcranial
magnetic
stimulation
under
various
conditions
,
including
sleep
(n
=
6
)
,
general
anesthesia
(n
=
16
)
,
and
severe
brain
injury
---------------
in
addition
,
parietal
regions
appear
most
relevant
for
quantifying
arousal
and
awareness
.


this
indicator
provides
insights
into
the
neural
correlates
of

introduction

responsiveness
is
often
thought
to
reflect
consciousness
,
and
for
a
long
time
,
unresponsiveness
was
considered
as
a
surrogate
of
unconsciousness
.


however
,
consciousness
and
responsiveness
are
two
different
concepts¹
.


consciousness
is
considered
to
be
absent
during
sleep
or
anesthesia
,
but
in
certain
instances
,
subjective
experience
can
still
occur
(e

g

,
dreaming
)
^
(2
,3
)
.


similarly
,
consciousness
has
been
described
as
a
result
of
both
arousal
and
awareness
components⁴
.


arousal
refers
to
the
overall
state
of
alertness
(or
wakefulness
)
.


in
contrast
,
awareness
refers
to
---------------
follow
commands
.



various
levels
of
consciousness
exist
in
physiological
,
pharmacological
,
and
pathological
modifications
of
consciousness
(table 1
)
.


in
non-rapid
eye
movement
(nrem
)
sleep
with
no
subsequent
reports
of
subjective
experiences
,
both
arousal
and
awareness
are
low
.


however
,
in
rapid
eye
---------------
recent
findings
suggest
that
a
minority
of
patients
under
anesthesia
may
also
be
conscious
of
their
environment
during
a
surgical
procedure
,
which
is
referred
to
as
connected
consciousness
.


these
patients
exhibit
the
ability
to
follow
commands
using
the
isolated
forearm
technique⁸
,
without
recollection
upon
awakening

index

that
reliably
discriminates
between

(pci_

:
rem
sleep
;
wakefulness
;
ketamine-induced

;
and

)¹⁷
.


however
,
pci
cannot
discriminate
rem
sleep
or
ketamine-induced
anesthesia
from
healthy
wakefulness
.


in
addition
,
multiple
trials
are
required
to
compute
pci
^
(16
,17
)
.


a
few
studies
have
attempted
to
develop
an
objective
measure
of
consciousness
from
resting-state
eeg
brain
activity
^
(3
,4
,18
,19
)
.


interestingly
,
the
spectral
exponent
,
which
quantifies
the
slope
of
power
spectral
density
of
resting-state
eeg
activity
,
is
another
measure
of
consciousness
that
is
highly
correlated
with
pci
and
allows
distinguishing
between
ketamine
and
propofol
or
xenon-induced
anesthesia³
.


in

,
when

---------------

therefore
,
an
alternative
measure

requiring
fewer
trials
,
would
be
a
valuable
and
necessary
tool

in

the

with
the
aim

with
disorders
of
consciousness
(doc
)
,
which
includes
patients
diagnosed
as
uws
and
mcs
patients
.


we
hypothesized
that
our
proposed
eci
can
clearly
distinguish
between
the
two
components
of
consciousness
under
physiological
,
pharmacological
,
and
pathological
conditions
.



to
verify
the
proposed
indicator
,
we
next
compared
eci
^
(awa

with
pci
,
which
is
a
reliable
index
for

then
,
we
applied
eci
to
additional
resting-state

data
acquired
in
the
anesthetized
participants

we
hypothesize
that
if

can
learn
characteristics
related

,
it
could
calculate
eci
accurately
even
without
tms
in
the

it

we

,

,
and

furthermore
,
we
show
that
the

to
quantifying

in

a

.


in
step
2
,
the
converted
3d
feature
was
used
on
a
convolutional
neural
network
in
the
two
components
of
consciousness
:
arousal
and
awareness
.


in
each
arousal

awareness
state
,
the
eeg
data
were
trained
as
two
classes
(low

therefore

we
represented

---------------
to
demonstrate
that
the
method
can
be
easily
applied
to
a
new
set
of
patients
(without
additional
training
)
to
identify
their
state
of
consciousness
in
a
clinical
setting
,
we
computed
eci
using
the
hold-out
approach
.


the

data

our

therefore
,
eci
is
a
significantly
practical
and
reliable
indicator
to
evaluate
levels
of
consciousness
under
various
conditions
.


our
analyses
using
lrp
highlighted
the
major
role
of
the
parietal
region
in
determining
consciousness
,
as
the
classifier
primarily
uses
brain
activity
in
this
lobe
for
predicting
low
and
high
states
of
arousal
and
awareness
.


---------------
spatiotemporal
information
was
higher
than
that
of
spatio-spectral
information
.


using
our
framework
,
it
was
shown
that
temporal
information
discriminates
different
levels
of
consciousness
more
clearly
than
spectral
information
,
as
the
functional
connectivity
associated
with
consciousness
changes
in
both
space
and
time³⁷
.


however
,
this
does
not
imply
that
temporal
information
is
more
important
than
spectral
information
for
distinguishing
consciousness
.


temporal
information
has
more
distinct
characteristics
than
spectral
information
for
predicting
the
state
of
consciousness
in
the
proposed
framework
.


nevertheless
,
pci
also
used
spatiotemporal
dynamics
in
tms-evoked
responses¹⁶
,
which
is
significantly
important
for
distinguishing
consciousness
.



we
applied
transfer
learning

single
domain

as

they
were

this

feature
,
which

and
low
states
in
arousal
and
awareness
,
can
be
interpreted
in
line
with
the
posterior
hot
zone
of
consciousness⁴⁰
.


local
changes
in
this
parietal
region
are
associated
with
the

of

and
the

in

,

triggered
a
local

similar
to

.


---------------
model
as
the
classification
decision
was
primarily
based
on
eeg
signals
over
the
parietal
region
,
which
is
suggested
to
be
a
hot
spot
of
consciousness
,
compared
to
the
frontal
region⁴³
.


the
difference
in
the
parietal
region
could
be
clearly
identified
through
correct
trials
during
sleep
and
healthy
wakefulness
.


it
is
meaningful
that
the
frontal
region
contributed
less
than
parietal
regions
in
the
context
of
the
controversy
regarding
the
spatial
localization
of
the
neural
correlates
of
consciousness
^
(40
,45
)
.


considering
the
subcortical
influences
related
to
striatal-thalamic
circuits
,
it
has
been
recently
observed
that
the
parietal
region
contributes
more
to
the
levels
of
consciousness
than
the
frontal
region⁴⁷
.


the
implication
of
the
parietal
cortex
in
consciousness
has
also
been
demonstrated
in
other
neuroimaging
modalities
,
such
as
functional
magnetic
resonance
imaging⁴⁸
and
magnetoencephalography⁴⁹
.


---------------
in
conclusion
,
we
proposed
eci
as
a
neurophysiological
indicator
to
simultaneously
discriminate
the
levels
of
arousal
and
awareness
in
modified
states
of
consciousness
.


this
tool
allows
disentangling
the
levels
of
consciousness
,
with
a
single
measure
,
in
different
clinical
settings
such
as
monitoring
surgical
interventions
(i
.

e
.


,
anesthesia-induced
states
)
and
diagnosing
patients
with
doc
.


this
---------------
resting-state
eeg
without
tms
,
and
requires
fewer
trials
.


therefore
,
the
proposed
indicator
can
be
a
reliable
discriminator
and
valuable
tool
as
an
objective
measure
of
consciousness
.


as
parietal
regions
appear
to
be
the
most
relevant
for
classification
,
an
eeg
configuration
around
that
area
could
be
sufficient
if
eci
is
used
in
clinical
practice
.


these
findings
could
be
useful
in
diagnosing
severely
brain-injured
patients
and
monitoring
their
levels
of
consciousness
in
real-time
,
especially
in
clinical
settings
where
time
constraints
preclude
long-duration
assessment
.


the
proposed
reliable
eci
can
provide
insights
into
the
classification
of
conscious
levels
using
deep
learning
and
neural
correlates
of
consciousness

the
politics
of
consciousness


[edit
]

consciousness
typically
refers
to
the
idea
of
a
being
who
is
self-aware
.


it
is
a
distinction
often
reserved
for
human
beings
.


this
remains
the
original
and
most
common
usage
of
the
term
.


^
(
[1

for
marx
,
consciousness
describes
a
person
'
s
political
sense
of
self
.


that
is
,
consciousness
describes
a
person
'
s
awareness
of
politics
.


for
marx
,
an
authentic
consciousness
was
linked
to
understanding
one
'
s
true
position
in
history
.


while
hegel
placed
god
behind
the
workings
of
consciousness
in
people
,
marx
saw
the
political
economy
as
the
engine
of
mind
.


^
(
[2

)

in
the
20th
century
,
many
social
movements
and
intellectuals
have
developed
this
use
of
consciousness
.

in
marx
'
s
view
,
consciousness
was
always
political

it

.


what

consciousness
and
the
political-economy


[edit
]

for
marx
,
consciousness
is
a
reflection
of
the
political
economy
.


a
person
'
s
thoughts
tend
to
be
shaped
by
his
or
her
political
and
economic
circumstances
.


he
famously
wrote
,
"it
is
not
the
consciousness
of
men
that
determines
their
being
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
their
social
being
that
determines
their
consciousness
.

"


perhaps
marx
'
s
greatest
contribution
to
modern
thought
.


.


.


is
his

comprehensive
investigation
into
the
role
of
ideology
,
or
how
social

being
determines
consciousness
,
which
results
in
certain
(for
the
most

part
unconscious
)
belief
and
value
systems
depending
on
the
particular

economic
infrastructure
pertaining
at
the
time
.


from
a
marxian
point

of
view
all
cultural
artifacts--religious
systems
,
philosophical

positions
,
ethical
values--are
,
naturally
enough
,
products
of

consciousness
and
as
such
are
subject
to
these
ideological

pressures
.

critical
consciousness
,
conscientization
,
or
conscientização
in
portuguese
(

---------------
social
concept
developed
by
brazilian
pedagogue
and
educational
theorist
paulo
freire
,
grounded
in
neo-marxist
critical
theory
.


critical
consciousness
focuses
on
achieving
an
in-depth
understanding
of
the
world
,
allowing
for
the
perception
and
exposure
of
social
and
political
contradictions
.


critical
consciousness
also
includes
taking
action
against
the
oppressive
elements
in
one
'
s
life
that
are
illuminated
by
that
understanding
.


^
(

)
---------------

the
english
term
conscientization
is
a
translation
of
the
portuguese
term
conscientização
,
which
is
also
translated
as
"consciousness
raising"
and
"critical
consciousness"
.


the
term
was
popularized
by
brazilian
educator
,
activist
,
and
theorist
paulo
freire
in
his
1970
work
pedagogy
of
the
oppressed
.


freire
was
teaching
the
poor
and
illiterate
---------------

[edit
]

paulo
freire
defines
critical
consciousness
as
the
ability
to
intervene
in
reality
in
order
to
change
it
.


^
(
[3
]
)
critical
consciousness
proceeds
through
the
identification
of
"generative
themes"
,
which
freire
identifies
as
"iconic
representations
that
have
a
powerful
emotional
impact
in
the
daily
lives
of
learners
.

"
in
this
way
,
individual
consciousness
helps
end
the
"culture
of
silence"
in
which
the
socially
dispossessed
internalize
the
negative
images
of
themselves
created
and
propagated
by
the
oppressor
in
situations
of
extreme
poverty
.


liberating
learners
from
this
mimicry
of
the
powerful
,
and
from
the
fratricidal
violence
that
results
therefrom
is
a
major
goal
of
critical
consciousness
.


critical
consciousness
is
a
fundamental
aspect
of
freire
'
s
concept
of
popular
education
.



---------------
community
cultural
development
.


from
the
glossary
of
goldbard
'
s
2006
book
new
creative
community
:
"conscientization
is
an
ongoing
process
by
which
a
learner
moves
toward
critical
consciousness
.


this
process
is
the
heart
of
liberatory
education
.


it
differs
from
"consciousness
raising"
in
that
the
latter
may
involve
transmission
of
preselected
knowledge
.


conscientization
means
engaging
in
praxis
,
in
which
one
both
reflects
---------------

the
ancient
greeks
first
identified
the
essence
of
critical
consciousness
when
philosophers
encouraged
their
students
to
develop
an
"impulse
and
willingness
to
stand
back
from
humanity
and
nature
.


.


.


[and
]
to
make
them
objects
of
thought
and
criticism
,
and
to
search
for
their
meaning
and
significance
.

(

freire
explains
critical
consciousness
as
a
sociopolitical
educative
tool
that
engages
learners
in
questioning
the
nature
of
their
historical
and
social
situation
,
which
freire
addressed
as
"reading
the
world"
.


the
goal
of
critical
consciousness
,
according
to
freire
,
should
be
acting
as
subjects
in
the
creation
of
democratic
society
.


in
education
,
freire
implies
intergenerational
equity
between
students
and
teachers
in
which
---------------
staff
are
minor
actors
,
the
"teacher"
is
an
adviser

just

is
,
in

a
type
of
political

in

other

present
conflicting
