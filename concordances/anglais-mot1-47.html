Medieval Theories of Conscience

First published Tue Jan 19, 2021


consideration, however, has been devoted to what was believed to link
the psychological to the metaethical: the mental habit or act of
conscience (and its sister-concept of synderesis), though interest in
the subject has recently seen a modest resurgence (e.g., Hoffmann 2012,
Eardley 2013, and Dougherty 2018).

What is the scope and nature of this apparent ability to intuitively
grasp right from wrong? Can conscience err and, if so, do its dictates
still bind? The best way to address these and other questions is to
employ a developmental approach. The term conscience is still generally
used to refer to an innate moral sense, but it has slightly different
connotations today than it did in the medieval period, which in turn had
different connotations from what preceded it in pagan antiquity and in
Scripture. Still, medieval theories of conscience drew extensively on
these earlier sources. Since the concepts of conscience and synderesis
evolved over time, then, it will be necessary to take a linear approach
to the topic and begin with some background.

1. Background: The Pagan and Early-Christian Context

1.1 The Ancient Context: Judicial Conscience

To understand the medieval theory of conscience, it is essential to
examine its etymology. Unlike most philosophical categories that are
central to medieval thought, the concept of conscience did not have its
origins in Plato or Aristotle (Potts 1982: 687). Rather, most scholars
agree, it originated in the Greek playwrights of the fifth century BCE


1961: 5).

The English word “conscience” is derived from the Latin conscientia. Its
Greek equivalent is syneidesis. Both terms connote a state or act of
“sharing knowledge with oneself” (Sorabji 2014: 12). This knowledge is


objects in the outside world but can also “turn back on” (reflectere) or
become an object to themselves. As C. S. Lewis put it in his study of
the concept of concept of conscience in the Western tradition:

  Man might be defined as a reflexive animal. A person cannot help


  also Sorabji 2014: 12)

Lewis refers to this primarily pagan understanding of conscience as an
“inner witness”. It does not judge our actions as right or wrong, but
merely testifies to their existence:


  some other way. (Lewis 1960: 190)

Others, however, regard the sort of conscience that Lewis describes here
as a type of internal judge, and therefore refer to it as “judicial
conscience” (D’Arcy 1961: 8). While this property of the mind does not
necessarily issue binding rules, it does pass moral judgements on our
deeds. It would, however, eventually take on the role of issuing moral
dictates for future acts as well. Eric D’Arcy refers to this later form
of syneidesis or conscientia as the “legislative conscience” whose
innovator, he argues, was the Apostle Paul (ca. 5 CE–ca. 64/67 CE), the
most important founder of the Christian faith after Jesus of Nazareth
(D’Arcy 1961: 8).

1.2 St. Paul: Legislative Conscience

The judicial understanding of conscience continued well into the first
century of the Common Era. To be sure, Paul himself continued to employ
it. At the same time, D’Arcy credited Paul with introducing, in addition
to the “judicial conscience”, a novel conception he termed the
“legislative conscience”. It is not difficult to see why the earlier
judicial conception would later take on legislative features. This is
because the ability to judge past actions as either right or wrong—and


  by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not
  have the law. They show that the requirements of the law are written
  on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their
  thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending
  them. (Romans 2:14–15; NIV)


latter was later glossed as a reference to the natural law, which is
accessible to all people, non-Jews included, and is consistent with the
Mosaic Law. Notice that, according to the foregoing passage, conscience
(syneidesis) is not the ultimate source of right and wrong. Rather, the
foundation of right and wrong is the objective moral law, which is both
“written on [men’s] hearts” and borne witness to by conscience.

One might say, then, that the objective norm of morality on Paul’s
account is the moral law (or natural law). Conscience, however, might be
termed morality’s subjective norm. This is made clear in another passage
from St. Paul, where he is addressing the question of whether it is


since “food does not bring us near to God—we are no worse if we do not
eat, and no better if we do” (1 Corinthians 8:8; NIV). Still, even
though the consciences of such Christians are erroneous, they must
follow them since conscience, Paul suggests, is a rule of conduct
(Romans 14:13–23). Eric D’Arcy sums up these two important contributions
of St. Paul as follows:

  St. Paul, then, introduces an entirely new phase in the history of the
  term “conscience” in moral theory, and two new features characterize
  his use of it. First, it is to play a directive role before action
  takes place. In the pagan writers, conscience did not appear on the
  scene until after the action was performed, and its role was purely
  judicial; but in St. Paul, conscience is credited with a legislative
  function, and it induces an obligation in the proper sense. Second,
  conscience is fallible: the directions it issues may be mistaken; but
  whether it be mistaken or not, it seems that we are bound to follow
  its rulings. (D’Arcy 1961: 11–12)

In sum, we might follow Sorabji’s suggestion that this phase in the
development of the concept of conscience—that is, from its origins in
fifth-century BCE Greek literature to the first-century CE—has eight
features (Sorabji 2014: 36).


1.3 St. Jerome: The Invention of Synderesis

That conscience was so central a concept in St. Paul’s writings
guaranteed it an important place in the moral theology of the Greek and
Latin Fathers, especially St. Basil, John Damascene and St. Ambrose.


and the ox’s face the appetitive part (cf. Plato, Republic, 436b–441b).
What did the eagle represent? According to Jerome, it represented that
“spark of conscience” (scintilla conscientiae) which makes us aware of
our sinfulness when reason, spirit or desire become disordered. Medieval
manuscripts refer to this psychological property as synderesis (or


  Now above these three was the eagle; so in the soul, they say, above
  the other three elements and beyond them is a fourth, which the Greeks
  call synderesis. This is that spark of conscience which was not
  quenched even in the heart of Cain, when he was driven out of
  paradise. This it is that which makes us, too, feel our sinfulness


  by sham Reason. It is natural to identify synderesis with the eagle,
  since it is distinct from the other three elements and corrects them
  when they err […] However, we also see that this conscience
  (conscientia) is cast down in some people, who have neither shame nor
  insight regarding their offences, and loses its place […]. (commentary


however, he does admit the existence of those who are shameless and
lacking in moral insight. Such people are oblivious to their offenses
because, according to Jerome, their conscience (conscientia) ceases to
be present in them (“looses its place”). If synderesis cannot be lost,
but conscience can, then it seems to follow that they are separate
properties of the soul. In any case, whatever Jerome’s intention, this
curious passage was indirectly handed down to the Middle Ages via the


2.1 Peter Lombard: The Scholastic Origins of the Debate

Peter Lombard’s role in the evolution of the concept of conscience is
both surprising and unsurprising. It is—at first sight,
anyway—surprising because Lombard does not discuss conscience or
synderesis in any actual detail. Indeed, he does not, strictly speaking,
mention the terms “synderesis” or “conscience” at all. What he does is
merely to allude to Jerome’s commentary on Ezekiel in the context of
discussing the will’s role in how rational agents can naturally want



Lombard’s brief mention of Jerome’s “spark of reason” (sic) in the
aforementioned passage is the full extent of his treatment of conscience
and synderesis. Still, that was sufficient to ensure that it would
receive robust attention by later scholastics, who would track down the


turned to Jerome’s text in order to scrutinize the original passage.
There, they discovered his apparent distinction between synderesis and
conscience, which in turn would come to frame the parameters of the
later medieval debate. If synderesis and conscience are in fact two
separate parts of the soul, for instance, what is their relationship to
one another? What, come to that, are their respective natures and,


Stephen Langton (1155–1228), regent master of theology at Paris and
later Archbishop of Canterbury, is important in the present context less
for any systematic treatment of conscience—indeed Stephen scarcely
touches on the issue at all—than for his somewhat scattered views on
synderesis. The relevant treatment comes in Stephen’s Quaestiones


1948: 113). D’Arcy sums up Langton’s position as follows:

  Remorse of conscience is the work, not of synderesis, but of reason,
  for synderesis remains at the level of general principles, whereas
  reason descends to the concrete case; but it is precisely over the
  concrete case that remorse of conscience is felt; hence it is by
  reason, and not by synderesis, that we sin. (D’Arcy 1961: 23–24)



as we will see, influence later thinkers such as Aquinas.

2.3 Philip the Chancellor: The First Systematic Treatment of Synderesis and Conscience

Although Stephen Langton was the first scholastic to touch on the issue
of synderesis in any depth, it was Philip the Chancellor (ca. 1170–1237)
who wrote the first treatise devoted to exploring the relationship
between synderesis and conscience (Lottin 1948: 139–157). As chancellor
of Notre Dame, Philip had the right to grant the license to teach in the
theology faculty at Paris, and it was under his tenure that the


for the former, and one for the latter. Although primarily an
administrator, Philip was also a trained theologian. His most important
work is the Summa de bono, which includes the treatise on conscience.

In his treatise Philip sets out to answer several questions related to


who apparently share the view that synderesis is a faculty of the soul
independent of the others (Philip the Chancellor, Summa de bono:
Treatise on Conscience; Potts trans. 1980: 95–96).

Against the claim that synderesis is a power of the soul, Philip


  is a disposition arising naturally in conjunction with that
  potentiality by which the natural will is directed to what is good
  without qualification. (Summa de bono: Treatise on Conscience; Potts
  trans. 1980: 96)



  potentiality or a disposition, the right answer lies in taking
  something in between: a dispositional potentiality. (Summa de bono:
  Treatise on Conscience; Potts trans. 1980: 97)

It would seem, then, that synderesis is a potentiality, albeit an


Philip puts it, synderesis is that which “murmurs back against sin and
correctly contemplates and wants what is good without qualification”
(Summa de bono: Treatise on Conscience; Potts trans. 1980: 100).

On the matter of conscience and how it is related to synderesis, Philip
distinguishes them. For one thing, conscience can be mistaken while
synderesis cannot. Specifically, conscience is the result of a
concurrence of synderesis with free decision (liberum arbitrium). Put
otherwise, it is the specific application of a general moral principle
that is the outcome of deliberation. When correctly applied, conscience
is correct. When incorrectly applied, it errs. In either case, the
judgement of conscience generates a moral obligation to act. Philip uses
the following example of how synderesis, which is always right, can
nonetheless conjoin with an erring conscience (Potts 1980: 104):

1.  Unerring universal premise of synderesis: “Everyone who falsely


2.  Erring minor premise of reason: “This Christ fellow is falsely
    claiming to be the Son of God”.
3.  Erring judgement of conscience: “Therefore this Christ fellow should
    be put to death”

From the foregoing example, it is clear that synderesis delivers a
general, non-deliberative proposition, while conscience yields what
Potts calls a particular, “deontic proposition”:



3. The Later-Scholastic Tradition

3.1 St. Bonaventure: Conscience as Cognitive/Synderesis as Affective

One of the most prominent representatives of the Franciscan intellectual


faculty, a position he held until 1257. His commentary on the Sentences
is the fruit of these lectures, and it is in this work that he discusses
the topics of conscience and synderesis. For Bonaventure we not only
possess innate moral knowledge, but we also have an inextinguishable
inclination towards achieving the good. Our inborn knowledge of the
former, that is, of the natural law, is associated with conscience,
which resides in the intellect, while our inclination towards desiring
the good is associated with synderesis, which inheres in the will.

What is the ontological status of conscience? According to Bonaventure,
just as theologians have disagreed over the nature of “thought”,
defining it variously as the power of thinking, a habit or an
apprehended principle of knowledge, so too have they differed over how
to define “conscience” (conscientia). Most commonly, however, the term
has been used to refer to a cognitive habit or disposition that relates
to the practical as opposed to the theoretical intellect. Indeed, it is



  theoretical knowledge perfects our thought to the extent that the
  latter is theoretical, whereas conscience is a disposition perfecting
  our thought to the extent that it is practical, or to the extent that
  it directs us towards deeds. (Bonaventure, commentary on the


Is such a disposition innate or acquired? It is possible, according to
Bonaventure, to find authorities on both sides of the debate. For the
opinion that conscience is innate, Bonaventure cites, among other
authorities, St. Paul’s famous reference to a moral law that is “written
on [men’s] hearts” in Romans 1:14–15. He also appeals to a “natural
instinct to seek blessedness and [to] honor [one’s] parents” (commentary
on the Sentences, 2.39: a. 1, q. 2; McGrade trans. 2001: 175–176). For
the opinion that conscience is not innate, on the other hand,
Bonaventure cites Aristotle’s claim that the soul is a blank slate.
Bonaventure’s solution is to find a middle position between St. Paul, on
the one hand, and Aristotle, on the other. His conclusion: conscience is
part innate, part acquired.



principles of practical reason. This innate capacity to immediately
grasp such principles as true or not in the realm of practical reason is
called conscience. It is associated, for Bonaventure, with the
Augustinian “natural light”—or “natural tribunal”—that is built into the
structure of the mind and which permits rational agents to intuitively

In what sense, though, is conscience acquired? Although the ability to
judge the deontic propositions of the natural law as self-evidently true
is innate, it does not follow that the contents of such propositions are

propositions is Potts’, and although the case cited is an example of an
erroneous conscience (Bonaventure argues that male circumcision and the
prohibition on eating pork are no longer applicable), it accurately sums
up Bonaventure’s distinction between propositions that are “very clearly

or derived precepts is germane to the question of whether conscience can

  the Sentences 2.39: a. 2, q. 3, ad 4; Potts trans. 1980: 120)

Is one obliged to always follow one’s conscience? It depends, since
conscience is fallible. If what it dictates is in accordance with God’s
will, then one is obliged to follow it on pain of eternal damnation. If
erroneous—if what it dictates is contrary to the divine will—as is
sometimes the case when applying basic deontological principles, then
conscience does not bind. Rather, the agent has an obligation to correct
the error in order to bring his conscience into line with the natural
law. If he does not, and follows his erroneous conscience, he commits a
mortal sin. “It is clear that conscientia always either binds us to do
what it tells us, or binds us to change it” (commentary on the Sentences
2.39: a. 1, q. 3; Potts trans. 1980: 114–115). Obviously, then, the
intellect plays an important role in achieving happiness given its
possession of conscience. But what of the will? Does it not have an
equally important role to play in the moral life? Yes: in its possession
of synderesis. In line with tradition, Bonaventure calls synderesis the
“spark of conscience” (commentary on the Sentences 2.39: a. 2; McGrade
trans. 2001: 186). He breaks with tradition, however, in arguing that it
inheres in the will rather than in the intellect. Indeed synderesis, for
Bonaventure, is precisely the counterpart of conscience insofar as the
will, like the intellect, has an innate inclination towards the moral
(as opposed to the useful) good. In the case of the intellect this
disposition takes the form of the “natural light” of conscience that
apprehends the first principles of the natural law; in the case of the
will, it takes the form of synderesis: a “natural bias” towards desiring
the moral good. There is one sense, however, in which synderesis is not
exactly analogous to conscience. While it looks very much like a habit,
synderesis is rather, according to Bonaventure (presumably following
Philip the Chancellor), a habit-like power of the soul (commentary on

cannot reorient themselves towards the good. Still, when synderesis
follows the innate judgement of conscience with respect to basic deontic
principles, which can never err, then it too functions correctly because
that is its natural state. It has the potential to go wrong and fall


the agent sins.

3.2 St Thomas Aquinas: Synderesis and Conscience as Cognitive

Thomas Aquinas (1224/25–1274) is, by any measure, one of the most
important, if not the most important, scholastic theologian of the later
Middle Ages. Although his views on conscience and synderesis have
received less attention in recent years than his theory of natural law,
this is unjustified. For the scholastics, a full account of morality


knowledge of right and wrong.

Aquinas discussed the issues of synderesis and conscience in several of
his major works, from his early commentary on the Sentences and the De
veritate to his mature Summa theologica (see D’Arcy 1961: 36–47). As


“habit-like faculty”. Aquinas, as might be expected, hews much closer to
his Dominican mentor and teacher Albert the Great (ca. 1200–1280) for
whom both synderesis and conscience belong to the intellect (see
Dougherty 2018: 221).



object of the practical intellect is the good “under the aspect of
truth” (Thomas Aquinas, Summa theologica I, q. 79, a. 11, ad. 2).
Synderesis and conscience, for Aquinas, both belong to the practical
intellect.



Like speculative reasoning, practical reasoning generally takes a
deductive form. Just as science is the conclusion of the demonstrative
syllogism, so conscience is the conclusion of a practical syllogism. The
practical syllogism, like the demonstrative syllogism, contains a major
premise, a minor premise and a conclusion. The major premise is drawn or


and minor premises, a conclusion is drawn that generates a moral
obligation to act (Hoffmann 2012: 258). This inferential judgment is
associated, for Aquinas, with conscience: an act—as opposed to a faculty
or a habit—that includes a number of applications, such as “to witness,
to bind, or incite, and also to accuse, torment, or rebuke” (Thomas
Aquinas, Summa theologica I, q. 79, a. 13, corp.).

Conscience acts as a “witness” when it is consciously aware of some
personal wrongdoing, whether of commission or omission. It “binds” or
“incites” when it makes a judgement that some act should be performed.
Finally, it “accuses”, “torments” or “rebukes” when it judges that some
past action was either morally acceptable or it was not. Although it is
difficult to see how conscience in the first sense—conscience as
witness—can function as an application of knowledge to conduct, this
seems less problematic in the second and third senses of the term, which
harken back to the legislative and judicial senses of conscience found
in St. Paul and pagan antiquity, respectively (D’Arcy 1961: 46). In any
case, an example of the way in which conscience applies the natural
law—whose principles are apprehended by synderesis— is articulated in
Aquinas’s De veritate:


  higher reason presents this minor premise “sexual intercourse with
  this woman is forbidden by the law of God”, the application of
  conscience will be made by concluding: “this sexual intercourse is to
  be avoided”. (De veritate, q. 17, a. 2, corp.; cited in Dougherty
  2018: 222)

Now the dictates of conscience can either be right, if correctly deduced
from the natural law, or wrong, if they are incorrectly deduced. The
dictates of the former are the product of a “correct conscience” and the
judgements of the latter are the result of an “erroneous conscience”.
Since synderesis is infallible, the main source of an erroneous
conscience, when it does occur, is the agent’s adoption of a faulty
minor premise in the practical syllogism (De veritate q. 17, a. 2; Potts
trans. 1980: 132–133).

Now it is clear that we have an obligation to follow a correct
conscience since to do so contributes to achieving our final end. But
what of an erroneous conscience? Does this have any authority? For
Aquinas, an erring conscience also binds. It does not, however,
necessarily excuse. As Hoffmann puts it,

  regardless of whether my action is objectively good, evil or
  indifferent, conscience binds, for it is by means of conscience that
  an action is proposed to me as good, bad, or indifferent. (Hoffmann
  2012: 260)


refrains. According to Aquinas, this agent, although he does what is
objectively right, nonetheless sins. Why? Because in choosing the
opposite of what his conscience dictated, he chose to do something he
believed to be evil. And choosing what is (subjectively if not
objectively) wrong, for Aquinas, is a sin: “[F] from the very fact that


thereto becomes evil” (Summa theologica, I-II, q. 19, a. 5, corp.).

What follows from this is that conscience, whether right or erroneous,
always binds. As to the question of whether an erroneous conscience
excuses, on the other hand, that depends on the type of ignorance that
causes it. This is because some types of ignorance render an act


  theologica I-II, q. 19, a. 6, corp.)

Ignorance that contributes to an erroneous conscience that is in any way
voluntary is vincible, or able to be corrected, and therefore culpable
if followed. This generally happens where the agent’s ignorance of the


Unfortunately, as we have seen, such precepts are of a very general
character, such as “do good and avoid evil”. For such general knowledge
to be applicable by conscience, it must be further specified. This
further specification comprises the secondary precepts of the natural
law, which are closely drawn from the former precepts and from natural



A final problem seems to emerge: are we not, according to Aquinas’s
account of the erroneous conscience, left with the possibility of a
moral dilemma? For if we have an obligation to always follow our
consciences, but we sometimes sin when we do follow them, then it seems
that we are sometimes put into a double bind. We seem, that is, to
sometimes have conflicting obligations so that regardless of what we do,
we sin. Aquinas’s solution is that it is only wrong to follow a
conscience that is in a state of vincible ignorance. Since such
ignorance is by definition correctable, we can always resolve the
apparent dilemma by choosing to put aside our ignorance. As far as
acting from invincible ignorance is concerned, we are pardoned.

3.3 William of Ockham: New Directions in the Understanding of Synderesis and Conscience

With the fourteenth-century theologian William of Ockham (1285–1347) we
encounter some radically new developments on the topics of synderesis
and conscience. While Ockham’s Franciscan predecessor John Duns Scotus
had disagreements with Aquinas about the nature of the moral law, Scotus
fundamentally agreed with the Dominican in viewing synderesis and
conscience a habit and an act of the practical reason, respectively,
whose jobs were to apprehend the basic principles of morality in the
case of synderesis, and to apply them in the case of conscience (John
Duns Scotus, Ordinatio 2, d. 39; Wolter trans. 1997: 162–163). Like
Scotus, Ockham also agrees with Aquinas in several crucial respects.


tradition which preceded him, however, is in his abandonment of the
concept of synderesis, and in his unique approach to the invincibly
erroneous conscience.

It is difficult to know for certain why Ockham abandoned the concept of


moral epistemology was Pinckaers’ assumption that, because Ockham
discarded the traditional notion of synderesis, he must have done the
same for its twin concept of conscience. Pinckaers conceded that moral
principles, even if rooted in the divine will, still need to be applied
to particular situations on Ockham’s account. This role was, of course,
reserved for conscience in the earlier tradition. In Ockham, according
to Pinckaers, this role now became associated with practical reason and
prudence (Pinckaers 1993: 259).

A closer reading of the textual evidence suggests that Ockham very much
made use of the traditional concept of conscience. Indeed, much of how
he employed the concept was consistent with the tradition, especially as
articulated by Aquinas. Ockham associates the dictates of practical
reason, for example, with judgements of conscience. He is also emphatic
in his belief that rational agents have an absolute obligation to follow
their consciences, which can be correct or erroneous (Quaestiones
variae, q. 8, a. 1, OTh 8: 411). A conscience is correct when it is in
accord with right reason; it is erroneous when it is not. Finally, an
erroneous conscience, for Ockham, as with Aquinas, is either in a state
of vincible—voluntary and therefore culpable—ignorance, or in a state of
invincible—or involuntary—ignorance. Where conscience is in a state of
vincible ignorance, we must do our best to set it aside. In all these
cases Ockham follows the tradition, with one exception: that of the
invincibly erroneous conscience (Eardley 2013: 94–98), the state in
which the agent finds himself with the correct universal principles, but
non-culpably errs with respect to his grasp of the circumstances in



In what sense does Ockham depart from the tradition? For Ockham, the act
of following an invincibly erroneous conscience is not merely excusable,
as it was For Aquinas, but “virtuous and meritorious”. Consider the
following example from Ockham. While walking down the street one day you


determine that, although it is theoretically possible that he could be
fraud, this seems unlikely. For Ockham, you are obliged in this instance
to follow your conscience, and indeed you do. It turns out, however,
that this apparent homeless person is in fact a very wealthy person who
is impersonating a beggar. For Ockham, in following your conscience, you
are not merely excused or absolved of your error, but your (ignorant)
act is virtuous and, indeed, regarded by God as meritorious (so long,


  Indeed, had he not, while in such error, willed to help that person,
  he would have performed a vicious and demeritorious act because such
  an act would have been knowingly elicited against conscience and
  against non-culpable reason, because in the aforementioned case he
  does not know that he is in error but believes that he possesses right



What is motivating Ockham’s novel suggestion? Even Aquinas admitted that
we have an obligation to follow our consciences, whether right or
erroneous. When we do not do so, according to Aquinas, we sin. Of
course, when our consciences are in a state of voluntary or vincible
ignorance we also have a duty to put aside our error, otherwise we sin.
It is obviously not possible, however, to put error aside in the case of
invincible ignorance since such ignorance is by definition involuntary.
Accordingly, for Aquinas, we are obliged to follow such a conscience.
Although we act wrongly, in such cases, we are, for Aquinas, excused on
the grounds that we could not have known better. To return to Aquinas’s


such an act might be considered virtuous, much less meritorious. But for
