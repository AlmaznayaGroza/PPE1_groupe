Conscience – An Evil Conscience, Part 4 – Good and evil are the only two forms of conscience.

[Study Aired November 4, 2023]

Our inherent nature of an evil conscience knows to do good and doesn’t.
Such a one rightly divides the truth from error and is bewitched to
disobediently choose error.

  1Pe 3:15  But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts [where conscience
  resides]: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that
  asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear
  [prompted by a good conscience. How?]:
  1Pe 3:16  Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of
  you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your
  good conversation in Christ.

  Heb 10:22 Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of
  faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our
  bodies washed with pure water.

Hebrews 10:22 is the only verse in the Bible that directly refers to an
“evil conscience.” However, as previously pointed out, the Bible abounds
with stark nuances of both forms of a good or evil conscience. It is
impossible to speak about specific evil consciences without juxtaposing
them with their corresponding good conscience.

As we have seen in the preceding studies, a ‘good conscience’ is
dramatically differentiated by Adam and Eve partaking of the Tree of the
Knowledge of Good and Evil. Subsequently, a pandora’s box of evil
conscience blooms like leavening in bread dough.

As such, Mr Barid’s order of sixteen headings for his conscience study
does not descend in order of authority, but rather it is in order of
scriptural reference.

1.  1.  1.  The Natural Conscience
        2.  A defiled Conscience
        3.  An Evil Conscience
        4.  A Convicting Conscience
        5.  A Purged Conscience
        6.  A Pacified Conscience
        7.  A Good Conscience
        8.  An Answering Conscience
        9.  A Pure Conscience
        10. A Witnessing Conscience
        11. A Conscience Void of Offence
        12. An Emboldened Conscience
        13. A Wounded Conscience
        14. A Weak Conscience
        15. A Seared Conscience
        16. An Abandoned Conscience

Our study today is on an “Evil Conscience”, yet when we review the above
headings, the vast majority of them are all aspects of an evil
conscience. Nonetheless, it is the Saint’s God-given passion to study
every detail of His word, leaving nothing alive that breathes of
misunderstanding and thus our continuation of the sixteen mostly evil
versions of our conscience.

Clearly, Adam and Cain within us initiated the many forms of evil
consciences, yet the first time the term is directly used is in Hebrews
10:22, the entire Bible bleeding defiled evil consciences from the
beginning to near the end.

Hebrews 10 admonishes us to remain faithful to the New Covenant in
Christ and not regress to the Laws of Moses so etched in our hearts that
we temporarily battle a dual of tortured consciences as Paul did
regarding circumcision.



  Heb 10:20  By a new and living way [one that literally leads to life
  eternal], which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is
  to say, his flesh [revealing the path to a more excellent conscience];
  Heb 10:21  And having an high priest over the house of God;
  Heb 10:22  Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of
  faith, having our hearts sprinkled [a sprinkle (little by little) is
  the beginning of a storm, a flood of truth] from an evil conscience,
  and our bodies washed with pure water.
  Heb 10:23  Let us hold fast the [new] profession of our faith without


spirit and in truth. Formally, Israel worshiped God by attempting to
keep His laws through physical washings and sacrifices that most
certainly caused His people a good conscience via those laws. Yet, as
depicted by Saul, who became Paul, his pricked conscience while under
the slavery of the Old Covenant was subliminally aware of a strange new
conscience opposing most turbulently his established beliefs. Paul’s
boldness became dramatically evident through his earthquake of
miraculous blindness as he whimpered, ‘”Who art thou, Lord?” And the


against the pricks.’ (Acts 9)

Paul’s conscience was kicking against the pricks of his murderous ways
and imploring eyes staring back at him upon his many stonings as he
demanded the church of the day adhere to Moses’s laws; subliminally, he


worship of God by the same laws, only by spirit and not by sweat. It was
a shift in how each of us now perceived what constituted an ‘evil
conscience’ and was earth-shattering. That seismic shift in how to live
by the Law was quickly realized to be immensely liberating. Its
overpowering joy eclipsed martyrdom, as Steven exemplified in Acts 7.


  tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.

Unlike Paul, Moses wasn’t given or ready to have his conscience pricked
by a better conscience by the holy spirit…

  Heb 7:15  And it is yet far more evident: for that after the


  unchangeable priesthood.

… governed by a pure conscience. 

  Heb 7:25  Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that


  them.
  Heb 7:26  For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless [a
  pure conscience casts out all fear], undefiled, separate from sinners,
  and made higher than the heavens; 
  Heb 7:27  Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up


  is consecrated for evermore. 

Hebrews 7 highlights the most profound shift of a good conscience to a
means to attain a pure conscience through Christ, our High Priest.
Stephen was so committed to the spirit of a ‘good conscience’ of greater
purity that he was willing to be martyred. Stephen, Christ and all the
martyrs of old, all died having acted in good faith in accordance with
their consciences defying an ‘evil conscience’, and so, too, does the
Bride of Christ. From that foundation arises the focus of this study and
our immovable confidence…

  Heb 10:22  Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of
  faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our
  bodies washed with pure water.



Temple he is constructing.

The following scriptures annul an evil conscience.

  1Jn 3:18  My little children, let us not love in word, neither in


  assure our hearts before him.

There in the above scripture lies a conscience that is a foundation to
rightly discern the truth, and in the below scripture, the bisection of
choosing by His will a good or evil conscience.

  1Jn 3:20  For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart,



If we are an Elect of God, He assures us that our heart, that is, our
mind, will know the difference between a good and evil conscience, and
our Lord will provide the power for us to ultimately learn to choose
righteously.


  his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.

How easy is it to simply ask our Lord to give us a pure conscience in
all that we think. If we thus have that pure conscience, we are keeping
all the commandments of Christ, and our hope in the First Resurrection,
Lord willing, will be assured.


  1Jn 3:24  And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he
  in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the spirit which
  he hath given us [in practising a good conscience].

We have seen that we can’t have light without knowing darkness, and
comparably, a good conscience without knowing an evil conscience. Let’s
review some everyday examples of us being assailed by an evil
conscience, namely the seemingly imperishable lust of the eyes, the lust
of the flesh and the pride of life.

In the Old Covenant, an evil conscience was somewhat foreign to lust yet
still pricked their consciences.

  Mat 19:8  He [Christ] saith unto them [the Apostles], Moses because of


  adultery. 

Wow! What an indictment of a good conscience that mankind, subliminally
from the beginning, as did Adam, Eve and Cain at heart, knew by their
subsequent actions of hiding, revealed an evil heart against what
constituted a good conscience.

  Mat 5:27  Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou



In Matthew 5, Christ is instituting the spirit of keeping all His
commandments, resulting in growing a perfect conscience as He and the
Father perpetually exist without contrast.

Yet, like Cain and Paul, their consciences beheld a shadowy dichotomy of
a pricked conscience suggesting something (spiritually) awry. With that
same conscience, Solomon, who is who we are before knowing Christ,
withheld from himself no lust, as seen in Ecclesiastes 2:10. Solomon and
everyone under the Old Covenant were blessed materially for their lawful
dedication to loving God. Their physical wealth denoted their love for
God in a shadowy good conscience and was evidence of their righteous
living.



  a blessing and a curse;
  Deu 11:27  A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your
  God, which I command you this day [and resulting good conscience]:
  Deu 11:28  And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the
  LORD your God [and resulting evil conscience], but turn aside out of
  the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye
  have not known [and assuredly a resulting evil conscience].

As earlier expressed, much later Achan, under those commandments,  knew
by his evil conscience that he had done wrong since he hid his treasure
in the ground beneath his tent. The spirit of keeping the Lord’s
commands was already evident by the conviction of their Old Covenant
hearts.

Jesus, being flesh, lived in perfectly good conscience, yet He knew that
He was subject to an evil conscience by virtue of being tempted to
acquiesce with an evil conscience in submitting to the Devil’s wiles ~
evil was present within His flesh as it is in us, yet he didn’t sin, but
we do.


  none good but one, that is, God.

We all, as Solomon, if given to honestly study our consciences, would
conclude that our lusts are vanity, a vapour of joy unable to be
retained. Solomon came close to understanding the misty conclusion of
his polarised conscience, confusing him while he did his best to live by
the Laws of Moses, and yet knew some unidentifiable spirit couldn’t be
grasped. That missing something was the unheard-of holy spirit that
urges a pure conscience that later, in his experiences with the
Shulamite he frustratingly continued to see blackness. Christ’s love
isn’t awakened in Solomon and the world until He pleases in the


Life’s experiences only produced struggles against sin to be always
faced with the junction of choosing, by our Lord’s hand, a pathway of
either a good or evil conscience.

  Ecc 1:14  I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and,



Our works always cause us to constantly be vexed by having to choose the
route of a good or evil conscience. 

  Ecc 1:15  That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that



We are constantly besieged by the choice of a good or evil pathway of
conscience. 

  Pro 21:8  The way of him that is laden with guilt is exceeding
  crooked; But as for the pure [conscience], his work is right.

  Ecc 1:16  I communed with mine own heart [my conscience!], saying, Lo,
  I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they
  that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great


  knowledge increaseth sorrow. 

Without the holy spirit to prick our consciences, when in Babylon, we as
did Solomon, experienced an indefinable sorrow where immense physical
prosperity and wives (churches) eluded our quest for peace and perfect
joy, always searching but never coming to the truth. Our dichotic
consciences increased sorrow.

  Ecc 2:9  So I was great, and increased more than all that were before


  labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.

There is some truth that, in good conscience, particularly Solomon in
his time, and remnants of us in Babylon believe that it is our right to
pursue any joy of the flesh as long as we use our “wisdom” to not



With an elusive Shulamite-like epiphany, Solomon was further vexed by
his conscience. With classic introspection, he says, 

  Ecc 2:11  Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought,



How utterly frustrating it is in Babylon when a mist of Christ’s spirit,
for the most part, veils our conscience. When given a Stephen-like
revelation upon keeping all the commandments of God, a good conscience
hailstones our understanding, washing away the multitude of lies and
outshining all vexations of darkness.


~ and us ~ with captivating doctrines) while not understanding that they
all represent the same ruling deception. A man’s wife mirrors himself as
having a heart that ensnares his conscience with evil and fetters his
hands to ‘excuse’ himself and hide from sin (Ecc 7:25-29). She is the
reflection of his narcissism, and he is unwittingly taken by his own
beauty, having ascended to heaven unconsciously to presume a dethroning
of God. While pricked by a good conscience, he is so easily led away by
his lust and conceit to be god; flattering himself seems the more, at
least, temporal joy. Like Esau’s fleeting passion to satiate his
famished state, we always have time to reflect upon our choice of
conscience. If a semblance of righteousness resides, we should be
stabbed through our liver with an evil conscience for not fully
considering the Lord’s commandments.

  Pro 6:23  For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and
  reproofs of instruction are the way of life: [and peace through a good
  conscience]
  Pro 6:24  To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the
  tongue of a strange woman [the strange woman within ruling our
  conscience].
  Pro 6:25  Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her
  take thee with her eyelids. 



  Jas 1:12  Blessed is the man that endureth temptation [In this case
  choosing a good or evil conscience]: for when he is tried, he shall
  receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that
  love him. 
  Jas 1:13  Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for
  God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: [God
  doesn’t have an evil conscience to tempt anybody] 
  Jas 1:14  But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own
  lust, and enticed. [… with his bias towards an evil conscience]
  Jas 1:15  Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin [and
  the knowledge of an evil conscience that is amplified to hide the
  sin]: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.

The famous German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche said, “A bad
conscience is easier to cope with than a bad reputation.” Why? Because a
bad conscience is mostly contrived in secret, whereas a bad reputation
is humiliating and mostly for everyone to see. We are more likely to
fear another’s condemnation rather than God’s since God seems far off
and not in our faces. It is easier in the short term to hide a bad
reputation, even with having to live with the amplification of an evil
conscience forever.

  Pro 9:10  The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the



We can accuse, excuse and run and hide all we like from an evil
conscience but are guaranteed to face the music of the last Trump
heralding our judgment, either in this age or the next.

As stated in the previous studies in this series, by being made from the
outset in Adam having a trace of our Lord’s spirit, we know, as Adam
proved, a conscience when we are disobedient to God’s laws. If we
weren’t by default disobedient, we wouldn’t have known a good
conscience.

  Gen 3:4  And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely


physical power and later his power, his spirit, prior to being faced
with a fork in the road of knowledge and thoughts to choose good or evil
and a resulting conscience.

Conclusion

It is impossible to escape the God-given choice of good and evil and the
corresponding consciences.

The Bride of Christ is most grateful for her Lord making “all things”
hers to experience (1Co 3:22), the good equally with the day of evil, to
cause both a good and evil conscience to be astronomically impactful.
There is no escaping hiding among the trees and passing the buck when
discovered, only to vainly excuse ourselves from the evil that we are


Such a person rightly divides the truth from error. His foundation of
judgment is guided by the holy spirit of truth and, with a good
conscience, condemns his warring evil conscience.l

If we love lying, we love our bias for an evil conscience, one that, in
a soon-coming study, runs the grave risk of a “seared conscience” that
is impervious to a good conscience.
