1. Introduction

Each of us has, at one time or another, talked about our conscience. We
might have been “pricked by our conscience” or our conscience might have
“butted in” when it was not wanted. We might be going on quite happily
telling a lie to a friend, or might have accidentally walked out of a
shop without paying for something and it is our conscience that makes us
confess or stops us in our tracks spins us on our heels and takes us
back into the shop.

People from different walks of life talk of the “conscience”, from the
religious believer, the politician, the celebrity, to every day folk; we
might hear someone berate their conscience for nagging them to do
something they do not want to. People might be labelled “conscientious
objectors” because they feel their conscience is telling them to object
to certain political actions, e.g. war. A protester might lament the
erosion of their “freedom of conscience”. And we can find concepts very
similar to “conscience” in many non-Christian religious traditions both
Eastern and Western throughout history and from around the globe.1

However, the nature of conscience is obscure and consequently the
philosophical discussion of conscience is complex and has a long
history. It draws on issues in philosophical psychology, philosophy of
religion, epistemology, philosophy of mind, applied ethics, normative



In this chapter we’ll give a general overview of two theories of
conscience. One draws on Aquinas’s account; the other Sigmund Freud’s
(1856–1939). Although Freud is not typically seen as a philosopher (he’s
a psychologist) his account will provide us with some insights which
allows us to think philosophically about this thing we call “the
conscience”.

2. The History of Conscience

In the twenty-first century conscience is not thought of as solely a
religious idea. However talk of “conscience” was popularised, at least
in “the West”, due to its adoption by both Protestant and Catholic
traditions. In this section we’ll look how “conscience” is, and has
been, used in order to draw out some general features.

“Conscience” played a role in one of the most famous speeches in the
protestant reformation. Martin Luther (1483–1546), being charged with
heresy and being forced to recant by Charles V, stands his grounds and
says “Here I stand, I can do no other” and “I cannot nor will I retract
anything, since it is never safe nor virtuous to go against conscience”.
Luther believed that his God-given conscience was not allowing him to
recant, not even under the considerable pressure by the powerful people
before him. Or consider a more recent example.


his views said:

But, conscience asks the question, is it right? And there comes a time
when we must take a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor
popular, but one must take it because it is right.2

Conscience is, then, powerful. It seems that it can move a person to put
themselves in mortal danger, to “stand up and be counted”, to act
contrary to self-interest.

But it is not just saints and heroes that talk of conscience, conscience
has been cited by the most repugnant and morally abhorrent people who
have ever lived, racists, murderers, tyrants, dictators. For example as
Bettina Stangneth’s states in Eichmann Before Jerusalem: The Unexamined
Life of a Mass Murderer,3 a discussion of the inner life of one of the
Nazi’s most notorious officers: “Conscience was simply the ‘morality of
the Fatherland that dwells within’ a person, which Eichmann also termed
‘the voice of the blood’”.

Conscience can be male or female or both or neither, it can be one voice
or many, it can echo religious ideas, social ideas, racist ideas, lofty
ideas or ideas found in the filth of human corruption. Conscience can
develop at any particular age and dissipates at any age. It does not
“speak”, and it does “speak”, and does not have a language of choice.



There seem to be (at least) three related functions that we think the
conscience plays. First, it tells us what we ought to do as a guide for
our lives. Second, it is a source of moral knowledge. That is, we might
say “I know that stealing a pen is wrong because my conscience told me”.
Third it might be thought of as a motivation. That is, it might be the
thing that actually gets us up out of our seat to act in certain ways,



Just to clarify, we can see the difference in the first two of these
functions if we think of a tyrant who says for example: “my conscience
tells me I have to kill all mentally ill people to help the country”.
Clearly this is a case where her conscience is telling her how she ought
to behave. But, given that we think that killing the mentally ill is
morally wrong, we do not want to say that in this case her conscience
gives her knowledge of what is right and wrong. So it might be true that
the conscience gives us guidance but not knowledge.

Equally the opposite seems true, that we might know what is right and
wrong yet fail to be guided to do it. This predicament is what
Shakespeare captured in this famous quotation: “conscience doth make
cowards of us all” (Hamlet 3.1.78–82).

Consider another point. Conscience is subjective in that it is about one
reflecting inwards on oneself, on how one might “feel” about certain
things. It is not about looking out into the world, at a set of rules or
laws. We experience the conscience differently than we would if a
friend, priest, politician or Imam was telling us what to do. Of course,
although conscience is “inward looking”, that is not the same as saying
that we just make up what the conscience allegedly tells us. For
instance, we might think that what is right and wrong is dependent on
God but also think that we come to know what is right and wrong through
our conscience.

Finally it is worth noting that the term “conscience” was only
formalized in its modern moral meaning in the mid eighteenth century
(e.g. neither Plato nor Aristotle talk of conscience). However, note
that just because a term is modern, or just because there is
disagreement with how a term is used, that does not mean that the ideas


scientific community. This in itself does not lead us to the conclusion
that there are no molecules and no atoms. So the lack of term
“conscience”, and disagreement about what “conscience” means does not
mean that conscience is merely an “invention”. With all these points in
mind let’s consider one of the key thinkers in relation to conscience,
Aquinas.

3. Aquinas on Conscience

If you recall from Aquinas developed a Natural Law theology. The basic



They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts,
their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes
accusing them and at other times even defending them.4

Notice then that for Paul — and Aquinas — the “conscience” bears witness
sometimes accusing the person, sometimes defending them. For Aquinas
conscience is morally neutral, it simply “bears witness”, it is a
“sign-post” and after all signposts do not opinions on things (see
Aquinas, Summa, Part 1, Question 79, Article 13).

To be clear then Aquinas did not take conscience to be a source of moral
knowledge but as a guide. This means that Aquinas, unlike Luther and
post-reformation thinkers, took conscience to be fallible. For Aquinas
we may be wrong in following our conscience as it can move us in the
wrong direction/mislead us

For Aquinas the conscience is the act of applying the universal
principles (the Eternal/Divine law) to actual real life situations.

Aquinas explicitly defines “conscience” as the “application of knowledge
to activity” (Summa Theologica, I–II, I). So, if conscience for Aquinas
is about the application of knowledge to activity, this raises the
question how we get this knowledge? This is where another key technical
term is introduced. The synderesis. Synderesis is not the same as
conscience but is the innate ability of the mind — what he calls a habit
of the mind — to apprehend the eternal/divine laws. The role of
conscience is to apply the primary precepts discovered as the content of
synderesis.



reflection they will see that it is the straight line. This “coming to
recognize through reflection” is what Aquinas has in mind when he talks
about synderesis. For Aquinas, unlike conscience, synderesis is never
mistaken. Humans do wrong, thinks Aquinas, when conscience (and not
synderesis) makes a mistake. This means that a failure of conscience
needs to be clearly thought through on Aquinas’s account.

For Aquinas, conscience errs because of ignorance about how to apply the
eternal/divine laws, of which there are two types. Ignorance that can be
overcome by using one’s reason (vincible ignorance), and ignorance that


Invincible ignorance is doing something wrong when one could not have
known better; vincible ignorance is doing wrong when one ought to have
known better. But how might this relate to conscience?

Imagine two people going into a gun shop. The first person has no


and they have no record of mental illness. He is, for all intents and
purposes, a model citizen. This person buys a gun and goes on a killing
rampage. The owner of the shop, by following her conscience, has not
done something morally wrong because her ignorance is invincible; there
was no indication that this would have been a likely outcome.


This contrasts to the person who is sold a gun even though he has a
violent criminal record which would have shown up on a basic background
check. In this case, the owner of the gun shop following her conscience
has done something morally wrong because in this case her ignorance is
vincible.


and wrong through synderesis. However, even though we are infallible
about this, we can, and do, make mistakes in applying this knowledge. It
is our conscience (conscientia) which tells us how to apply this
knowledge and moves us to act. It can go wrong through ignorance.
Ignorance which could have been avoided (vincible) means our action is



In the next section, we will consider what Freud has to say about
conscience, and explain how he reconceptualises it as a psychological
and not theological concept, and in doing so argues we should not accept
it as an inherently good notion.

4. Freud and the Conscience

Freud is best known as a psychologist and the architect of


talk in the form of a “Freudian slip”. Among Freud’s many ideas his
conceptualization of the structure of the mind is key to his views on
conscience. He thinks the mind can be thought of as containing three
parts: the id, the ego and the super-ego. Freud’s account of conscience
is understood as the relation between these.



from the super-ego.

Where does the conscience come in? For Freud the conscience is the form
that the super-ego takes in addressing the ego. When the internalized
authority derived from parental (social/religious) rules and regulations
controls the ego is it is understood as “the conscience”. In our last
example it is our “conscience” that tells us to remove our elbows from
the table.

Notice then that our conscience often requires certain things from us
which we fail to achieve and this gives rise to guilt. For Freud, the
conscience can be thought of as synonymous with the “guilty conscience”.
Our ego is punished through guilt by the form of the super-ego we call
conscience. Furthermore, Freud says that when the super-ego fails to
deal properly with the id — when the pleasure principle is repressed —
this forms what he calls neurosis.

You can also hopefully see the differences between Aquinas and Freud.
First, the obvious point is that for Freud the conscience is not the
voice of God. Second, unlike Aquinas, Freud thinks that the conscience
could be bad, destructive and unhelpful. The conscience is the way the
ego experiences the authority of the super-ego. But the super-ego is
arrived at through the experiences we have. And, of course, we might
have had really bad experiences growing up where parents are stifling,
overly authoritarian, distant, cold, hard, violent, abusive etc. In
these sorts of cases the conscience would be stifling, overly
authoritarian, distant, etc. This means that although Freud does not
think we can, or should, get rid of the conscience he does think we
should treat it with a healthy dose of scepticism and hence not be
kowtowed by the “guilt” that is our ego’s punishment for falling short
of the super-ego; conscience is the product of our often non-ideal
upbringing rather than a divinely-inspired force for good.



generally, a pursuit of pleasure and happiness. People become sexually
active, fall in love and get married. This is the stage where we acquire
a fully developed conscience.

SUMMARY

The notion of “conscience” has appeared for thousands of years in
different cultures, even though it has not always been called
“conscience”. Modern Christian orthodoxy popularised it and
characterised it in relation to God’s voice, and guidance. Aquinas
thought that conscience is the way we understand how to apply what we
know. In Aquinas’s view, our conscience is fallible and might guide us
wrongly. When our conscience “gets it wrong” we can be either culpable —
through vincible ignorance — or not culpable — through invincible
ignorance.

Freud is less convinced that conscience is a force for good, and he is
certain that it has not got anything to do with God. For Freud
conscience can be either a good or bad. We can think of our mind as
having three parts, the id, ego and super-ego. The conscience for Freud
is the form the super-ego takes when it is trying to keep the ego in
line. It is internalized as the voice of authority. The super-ego is
about following rules but those rules do not come from “on high”, they
derive from the upbringing we have had. So if we have had a repressive
upbringing then the super-ego — the voice of conscience — will be
repressive. How we develop these three features of the mind is through
what Freud calls Psychosexual Development; if we do not develop


COMMON STUDENT MISTAKES

-   Writing conscious when meaning conscience.
-   Confuse synderesis and conscience.
-   Confusing conscience as guidance with conscience as the source of
    knowledge.
-   Believe Freud thinks the conscience is always bad.
-   Thinking that for Aquinas conscience is way of knowing what is right
    and wrong.
-   Thinking that because the term conscience is new, conscience itself
    is a modern invention.

ISSUES TO CONSIDER

1.  Do you think you have a conscience? What does it tell you?
2.  What is the difference between synderesis and conscience?
3.  Do you think that everyone ultimately knows — if they reason
    correctly — what is right and wrong?


    of the supposedly invincible knowledge, really vincible? We just
    need to try harder?
5.  What are the possible different roles for the conscience?
6.  Could the conscience be a morally bad thing?
7.  Why does Freud think we need to be cautious about listening to our
    conscience?
8.  How does Freud’s account of conscience relate to his Psychosexual
    Development Theory?
9.  What do you think about Freud’s Psychosexual Development Theory?


    of Freud’s Psychosexual Development Theory.
11. Could it ever make sense to talk about animals/robots having a
    conscience? If not, why not?
12. Do you think conscience will still shape our lives in one thousand
    years?
