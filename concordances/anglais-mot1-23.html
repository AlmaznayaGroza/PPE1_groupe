 Moral conscience is a part of the cognitive process in mind that tells
whether an act is morally right or wrong. In other words, it is
awareness of moral principles and whether act done is in accordance with
these principles or not. It is an instrument for self-control,
correction and regulation. The proper understanding of the moral
conscience is basic to our understanding of morality and to an ethical
conduct.

Role of moral conscience in ethical behaviour:

1.  Right choices: Human actions entail free decisions concerning ends


    concern making right choices based on the analysis of the nature of
    acts and the intentions and circumstances that are involved. Moral
    conscience help guide people to follow the right means to a right
    end.
2.  Inner guide: Moral conscience is our inner guide and it helps you
    figure out how to make good choices. As we grow up, we learn right
    from wrong. Our moral conscience is the thought and feeling we have
    that tells us whether something is a right or wrong thing to do or
    say. Thus it is a consistent guide to ethical decision making.
3.  Source of information: The moral conscience is considered the
    proximate norm of conduct because it is the immediate source of
    information guiding human actions. It directs human actions so that
    a person can transcend his animal instincts and human inclinations.
    Moral conscience allows man to exercise reason and thus allow an
    objective decision and act based on right values.
4.  Decision making: Without moral conscience a person would doubt even
    the smallest decisions.Since the judgment of moral conscience is a
    judgment about how an action conforms or does not conform to natural
    law, then, it is obligatory to act according to one’s conscience.
    Although there are persons who have a doubtful conscience which
    renders them unable to decide upon actions easily. A well-formed
    moral conscience is effective because it makes practical judgments
    with relative ease or after seeking necessary advice.
5.  Resolving ethical dilemmas: A human being always comes across
    ethical dilemmas in the decision making process. Moral Conscience
    acts as the guide for taking correct decisions when we have to
    choose between competing sets of principles in a given, usually
    undesirable or perplexing, situation. Example:  Helping accident
    victims on your way to an interview.
6.  Rational decision: Through our individual moral conscience, one
    becomes aware of his deeply held moral principles, and motivates
    accordingly to act upon those principles removing conflicts. As we
    assess our character, our behaviour and ultimately our self against
    those principles, conscience leads to proper analysis of good and
    bad of the situation and proper evaluation of various options.
7.  Ethical Awareness: This is our ability to recognise ethical values
    and principles. The moral conscience enables the human mind to
    understand the world in moral terms. This enhances our ability to
    make practical decisions in light of ethical values and principles.


    important in public services. Tostay impartial, it is important that
    public servants must object to any favours and corrupt activities.
    Moral conscience helps in conscientious objection by making an
    individual aware of the impact of his decisions on larger public.

Limitation of moral conscience in ethical behaviour:

1.  Individuality: Moral conscience is highly personal and varies with
    individuals. For example, a person might think killing muslim as
    moral in order to take revenge. In his conscience it is moral to
    kill muslim and help Hindu cause.
2.  Social norms: Moral conscience is guided by the social norms in
    general. It can impact the ethical thinking of an individual leading
    to unethical behaviour. For example, in Islamic countries many are
    misguided in name of jihad and act of terrorism is held moral and as
    an act of sacrifice for the cause of religion.
3.  Courage: Despite being morally conscience about what is right, an
    individual might lack courage to act ethically. For example, a civil
    servant might know that his colleague is taking bribes, he may not


    etc. define an individual’s morals. Thus, one might not know what he
    is doing is immoral. For example, a person might beat his wife as in
    his conscience mind it is not immoral, due to patriarchal mindset.

Thus the moral conscience plays an important role in making moral
decisions and actions. The reason behind conscience as the ultimate,
highest determiner of moral action and its authority is the idea that
when conscience and all other principles are properly understood, they
promote and motivate us to act that are in accordance with our nature.
