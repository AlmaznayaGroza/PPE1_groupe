Delacroix).

A conscience is a cognitive process that elicits emotion and rational
associations based on an individual's moral philosophy or value system.
Conscience stands in contrast to elicited emotion or thought due to
associations based on immediate sensory perceptions and reflexive
responses, as in sympathetic central nervous system responses. In common
terms, conscience is often described as leading to feelings of remorse
when a person commits an act that conflicts with their moral values. The
extent to which conscience informs moral judgment before an action and
whether such moral judgments are or should be based on reason has
occasioned debate through much of modern history between theories of


Ages.

Religious views of conscience usually see it as linked to a morality
inherent in all humans, to a beneficent universe and/or to divinity. The
diverse ritualistic, mythical, doctrinal, legal, institutional and
material features of religion may not necessarily cohere with
experiential, emotive, spiritual or contemplative considerations about
the origin and operation of conscience.^([1]) Common secular or
scientific views regard the capacity for conscience as probably
genetically determined, with its subject probably learned or imprinted
as part of a culture.^([2])

Commonly used metaphors for conscience include the "voice within", the
"inner light",^([3]) or even Socrates' reliance on what the Greeks
called his "daimōnic sign", an averting (ἀποτρεπτικός apotreptikos)
inner voice heard only when he was about to make a mistake. Conscience,
as is detailed in sections below, is a concept in national and
international law,^([4]) is increasingly conceived of as applying to the

universal agreement about its role in ethical decision-making, three
approaches have addressed it:^([8])

In the literary traditions of the Upanishads, Brahma Sutras and the
Bhagavad Gita, conscience is the label given to attributes composing
knowledge about good and evil, that a soul acquires from the completion
of acts and consequent accretion of karma over many lifetimes.^([9])


In the Zoroastrian faith, after death a soul must face judgment at the
Bridge of the Separator; there, evil people are tormented by prior
denial of their own higher nature, or conscience, and "to all time will
they be guests for the House of the Lie."^([12]) The Chinese concept of
Ren, indicates that conscience, along with social etiquette and correct
relationships, assist humans to follow The Way (Tao) a mode of life
reflecting the implicit human capacity for goodness and harmony.^([13])


stillness."

Conscience also features prominently in Buddhism.^([14]) In the Pali
scriptures, for example, Buddha links the positive aspect of conscience
to a pure heart and a calm, well-directed mind. It is regarded as a
spiritual power, and one of the "Guardians of the World". The Buddha
also associated conscience with compassion for those who must endure
cravings and suffering in the world until right conduct culminates in
right mindfulness and right contemplation.^([15]) Santideva (685–763 CE)


training the awareness to be like a "block of wood" when attracted by
vices such as pride or lust; so one can continue advancing towards right
understanding in meditative absorption.^([16]) Conscience thus manifests
in Buddhism as unselfish love for all living beings which gradually
intensifies and awakens to a purer awareness^([17]) where the mind



The Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius wrote in his Meditations that
conscience was the human capacity to live by rational principles that
were congruent with the true, tranquil and harmonious nature of our mind
and thereby that of the Universe: "To move from one unselfish action to

The Islamic concept of Taqwa is closely related to conscience. In the
Qur’ān verses 2:197 & 22:37 Taqwa refers to "right conduct" or "piety",
"guarding of oneself" or "guarding against evil".^([20]) Qur’ān verse

from God.^([21]) In Qur’ān verses 91:7–8, God the Almighty talks about
how He has perfected the soul, the conscience and has taught it the

is inherent in the soul, allowing it to be tested fairly in the life of


written by God in al-Lawh al-Mahfūz, the Preserved Tablet), humans
possess free will to choose between wrong and right, and are thus

connection to God enhanced by knowledge and practise of the Five Pillars
of Islam, deeds of piety, repentance, self-discipline and prayer; and
disintegrated and metaphorically covered in blackness through sinful
acts.^([23]) Marshall Hodgson wrote the three-volume work: The Venture
of Islam: Conscience and History in a World Civilization.^([24])

The Awakening Conscience, Holman Hunt, 1853

In the Protestant Christian tradition, Martin Luther insisted in the
Diet of Worms that his conscience was captive to the Word of God, and it
was neither safe nor right to go against conscience. To Luther,
conscience falls within the ethical, rather than the religious,
sphere.^([25]) John Calvin saw conscience as a battleground: "the
enemies who rise up in our conscience against his Kingdom and hinder his
decrees prove that God's throne is not firmly established
therein".^([26]) Many Christians regard following one's conscience as
important as, or even more important than, obeying human
authority.^([27]) According to the bible, written in Romans 2:15,
conscience is the one bearing witness, accusing or excusing one another,
so we would know when we break the law written in our hearts; the guilt
we feel when we do something wrong tells us that we need to


you, let him first cast a stone at her.' And again he stooped down, and
wrote on the ground. And they which heard it, being convicted by their
own conscience, went out one by one" [However the word 'conscience' is
not in the original New Testament Greek, and is not in the vast majority
of Bible versions.] (see Jesus and the woman taken in adultery). In the
Gospel of Luke (10: 25–37) Jesus tells the story of how a despised and
heretical Samaritan (see Parable of the Good Samaritan) who (out of
compassion/pity - the word 'conscience' is not used) helps an injured
stranger beside a road, qualifies better for eternal life by loving his
neighbor, than a priest who passes by on the other side.^([31])

This dilemma of obedience in conscience to divine or state law, was
demonstrated dramatically in Antigone's defiance of King Creon's order
against burying her brother an alleged traitor, appealing to the


living".^([32])

Catholic theology sees conscience as the last practical "judgment of
reason which at the appropriate moment enjoins [a person] to do good and
to avoid evil".^([33]) The Second Vatican Council (1962–65) describes:
"Deep within his conscience man discovers a law which he has not laid
upon himself but which he must obey. Its voice, ever calling him to love
and to do what is good and to avoid evil, tells him inwardly at the
right movement: do this, shun that. For man has in his heart a law
inscribed by God. His dignity lies in observing this law, and by it he
will be judged. His conscience is man’s most secret core, and his
sanctuary. There he is alone with God whose voice echoes in his
depths."^([34]) Thus, conscience is not like the will, nor a habit like
prudence, but "the interior space in which we can listen to and hear the
truth, the good, the voice of God. It is the inner place of our


to understand the path we ought to take, and once the decision is made,
to move forward, to remain faithful"^([35]) In terms of logic,
conscience can be viewed as the practical conclusion of a moral
syllogism whose major premise is an objective norm and whose minor
premise is a particular case or situation to which the norm is applied.
Thus, Catholics are taught to carefully educate themselves as to
revealed norms and norms derived therefrom, so as to form a correct
conscience. Catholics are also to examine their conscience daily and
with special care before confession. Catholic teaching holds that, "Man
has the right to act according to his conscience and in freedom so as
personally to make moral decisions. He must not be forced to act
contrary to his conscience. Nor must he be prevented from acting
according to his conscience, especially in religious matters".^([36])
This right of conscience does not allow one to arbitrarily disagree with
Church teaching and claim that one is acting in accordance with
conscience. A sincere conscience presumes one is diligently seeking
moral truth from authentic sources, that is, seeking to conform oneself
to that moral truth by listening to the authority established by Christ
to teach it. Nevertheless, despite one's best effort, "[i]t can happen
that moral conscience remains in ignorance and makes erroneous judgments
about acts to be performed or already committed ... This ignorance can
often be imputed to personal responsibility ... In such cases, the
person is culpable for the wrong he commits."^([37]) Thus, if one
realizes one may have made a mistaken judgment, one's conscience is said
to be vincibly erroneous and it is not a valid norm for action. One must
first remove the source of error and do one's best to achieve a correct
judgment. If, however, one is not aware of one's error or if, despite an
honest and diligent effort one cannot remove the error by study or
seeking advice, then one's conscience may be said to be invincibly
erroneous. It binds since one has subjective certainty that one is
correct. The act resulting from acting on the invincibly erroneous
conscience is not good in itself, yet this deformed act or material sin
against God's right order and the objective norm is not imputed to the
person. The formal obedience given to such a judgment of conscience is
good. Some Catholics appeal to conscience in order to justify dissent,
not on the level of conscience properly understood, but on the level of
the principles and norms which are supposed to inform conscience. For
example, some priests make on the use of the so-called internal forum
solution (which is not sanctioned by the Magisterium) to justify actions


"rejection of the Church's authority and her teaching ... can be at the
source of errors in judgment in moral conduct".^([38]) An example of
someone following his conscience to the point of accepting the
consequence of being condemned to death is Sir Thomas More
(1478-1535).^([39]) A theologian who wrote on the distinction between
the 'sense of duty' and the 'moral sense', as two aspects of conscience,
and who saw the former as some feeling that can only be explained by a
divine Lawgiver, was John Henry Cardinal Newman.^([40]) A well known
saying of him is that he would first toast on his conscience and only
then on the pope, since his conscience brought him to acknowledge the
authority of the pope.^([41])



punishment.^([42]) Similarly, although an occupation with national
destiny has been central to the Jewish faith (see Zionism) many scholars
(including Moses Mendelssohn) stated that conscience as a personal
revelation of scriptural truth was an important adjunct to the Talmudic
tradition.^([43][44]) The concept of inner light in the Religious
Society of Friends or Quakers is associated with conscience.^([3])
Freemasonry describes itself as providing an adjunct to religion and key
symbols found in a Freemason Lodge are the square and compasses
explained as providing lessons that Masons should "square their actions
by the square of conscience", learn to "circumscribe their desires and
keep their passions within due bounds toward all mankind."^([45]) The
historian Manning Clark viewed conscience as one of the comforters that
religion placed between man and death but also a crucial part of the
quest for grace encouraged by the Book of Job and the Book of


and the drive for social power of religious institutions, was the
capacity of humans to reach an individual spiritual truth through reason
and conscience.^([47]) Many prominent religious works about conscience
also have a significant philosophical component: examples are the works
of Al-Ghazali,^([48]) Avicenna,^([49]) Aquinas,^([50]) Joseph

Victor Hugo)




Charles Darwin thought that any animal endowed with well-marked social
instincts would inevitably acquire a moral sense or conscience, as its
intellectual powers approximated man's.

The secular approach to conscience includes psychological,
physiological, sociological, humanitarian, and authoritarian
views.^([53]) Lawrence Kohlberg considered critical conscience to be an
important psychological stage in the proper moral development of humans,
associated with the capacity to rationally weigh principles of


humorous personifications (such as Jiminy Cricket) and later in
adolescents by debates about individually pertinent moral
dilemmas.^([54]) Erik Erikson placed the development of conscience in
the 'pre-schooler' phase of his eight stages of normal human personality
development.^([55]) The psychologist Martha Stout terms conscience "an
intervening sense of obligation based in our emotional
attachments."^([56]) Thus a good conscience is associated with feelings
of integrity, psychological wholeness and peacefulness and is often
described using adjectives such as "quiet", "clear" and "easy".^([57])

Sigmund Freud regarded conscience as originating psychologically from
the growth of civilisation, which periodically frustrated the external
expression of aggression: this destructive impulse being forced to seek


against the person's own "ego" or selfishness (often taking its cue in
this regard from parents during childhood).^([58]) According to Freud,
the consequence of not obeying our conscience is guilt, which can be a
factor in the development of neurosis; Freud claimed that both the
cultural and individual super-ego set up strict ideal demands with
regard to the moral aspects of certain decisions, disobedience to which
provokes a 'fear of conscience'.^([59])

Antonio Damasio considers conscience an aspect of extended consciousness
beyond survival-related dispositions and incorporating the search for
truth and desire to build norms and ideals for behavior. ^([60])

Conscience as a society-forming instinct

[edit]



Jeremy Bentham: "Fanaticism never sleeps ... it is never stopped by
conscience; for it has pressed conscience into its service."

Michel Glautier argues that conscience is one of the instincts and
drives which enable people to form societies: groups of humans without
these drives or in whom they are insufficient cannot form societies and



War criminal Adolf Eichmann in passport used to enter Argentina: his
conscience spoke with the "respectable voice" of the indoctrinated
wartime German society that surrounded him.

Charles Darwin considered that conscience evolved in humans to resolve
conflicts between competing natural impulses-some about
self-preservation but others about safety of a family or community; the
claim of conscience to moral authority emerged from the "greater
duration of impression of social instincts" in the struggle for
survival.^([62]) In such a view, behavior destructive to a person's
society (either to its structures or to the persons it comprises) is bad
or "evil".^([63]) Thus, conscience can be viewed as an outcome of those
biological drives that prompt humans to avoid provoking fear or contempt
in others; being experienced as guilt and shame in differing ways from
society to society and person to person.^([64]) A requirement of
conscience in this view is the capacity to see ourselves from the point
of view of another person.^([65]) Persons unable to do this
(psychopaths, sociopaths, narcissists) therefore often act in ways which
are "evil".^([66])

Fundamental in this view of conscience is that humans consider some
"other" as being in a social relationship. Thus, nationalism is invoked
in conscience to quell tribal conflict and the notion of a Brotherhood
of Man is invoked to quell national conflicts. Yet such crowd drives may
not only overwhelm but redefine individual conscience. Friedrich
Nietzsche stated: "communal solidarity is annihilated by the highest and
strongest drives that, when they break out passionately, whip the
individual far past the average low level of the
'herd-conscience.'"^([67]) Jeremy Bentham noted that: "fanaticism never
sleeps ... it is never stopped by conscience; for it has pressed
conscience into its service."^([68]) Hannah Arendt in her study of the
trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem, notes that the accused, as with
almost all his fellow Germans, had lost track of his conscience to the
point where they hardly remembered it; this wasn't caused by familiarity
with atrocities or by psychologically redirecting any resultant natural
pity to themselves for having to bear such an unpleasant duty, so much
as by the fact that anyone whose conscience did develop doubts could see
no one who shared them: "Eichmann did not need to close his ears to the
voice of conscience ... not because he had none, but because his
conscience spoke with a "respectable voice", with the voice of the
respectable society around him".^([69])

Sir Arthur Keith in 1948 developed the Amity-enmity complex. We evolved
as tribal groups surrounded by enemies; thus conscience evolved a dual
role; the duty to save and protect members of the in-group, and the duty
to show hatred and aggression towards any out-group.


food) or in the wild.^([70]) One idea is that as people or animals
perceive a social relationship as important to preserve, their
conscience begins to respect that former "other", and urge actions that
protect it.^([71][72]) Similarly, in complex territorial and cooperative
breeding bird communities (such as the Australian magpie) that have a

conscience as a function of the brain that evolved to facilitate
altruism within societies.^([74]) In his book The God Delusion, Richard
Dawkins states that he agrees with Robert Hinde's Why Good is Good,


individuals to act altruistically towards its kin.^([75])

Neuroscience and artificial conscience

[edit]



Attempts have been made by neuroscientists to locate the free will
necessary for what is termed the 'veto' of conscience over unconscious
mental processes (see Neuroscience of free will and Benjamin Libet) in a
scientifically measurable awareness of an intention to carry out an act


the 'readiness potential.'^([79][80][81])

Jacques Pitrat claims that some kind of artificial conscience is
beneficial in artificial intelligence systems to improve their long-term
performance and direct their introspective processing.^([82])


Virtue ethics, Metaethics, Moral motivation, and Normative ethics

The word "conscience" derives etymologically from the Latin conscientia,
meaning "privity of knowledge"^([83]) or "with-knowledge". The English
word implies internal awareness of a moral standard in the mind
concerning the quality of one's motives, as well as a consciousness of
our own actions.^([84]) Thus conscience considered philosophically may
be first, and perhaps most commonly, a largely unexamined "gut feeling"
or "vague sense of guilt" about what ought to be or should have been
done.^([85]) Conscience in this sense is not necessarily the product of
a process of rational consideration of the moral features of a situation
(or the applicable normative principles, rules or laws) and can arise
from parental, peer group, religious, state or corporate indoctrination,
which may or may not be presently consciously acceptable to the person
("traditional conscience").^([86]) Conscience may be defined as the
practical reason employed when applying moral convictions to a situation
("critical conscience").^([87]) In purportedly morally mature mystical
people who have developed this capacity through daily contemplation or
meditation combined with selfless service to others, critical conscience
can be aided by a "spark" of intuitive insight or revelation (called
marifa in Islamic Sufi philosophy and synderesis in medieval Christian
scholastic moral philosophy).^([88][89]) Conscience is accompanied in
each case by an internal awareness of 'inner light' and approbation or
'inner darkness' and condemnation as well as a resulting conviction of

The Flemish mystic Jan van Ruysbroeck viewed a pure conscience as
facilitating "an outflowing losing of oneself in the abyss of that
eternal object which is the highest and chief blessedness".

Some medieval Christian scholastics such as Bonaventure made a
distinction between conscience as a rational faculty of the mind
(practical reason) and inner awareness, an intuitive "spark" to do good,
called synderesis arising from a remnant appreciation of absolute good


becoming a source of inner torment.^([89]) Early modern theologians such
as William Perkins and William Ames developed a syllogistic
understanding of the conscience, where God's law made the first term,
the act to be judged the second and the action of the conscience (as a
rational faculty) produced the judgement. By debating test cases
applying such understanding conscience was trained and refined (i.e.
casuistry).^([93])



The medieval Persian philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna) developed a sensory
deprivation thought experiment to explore the relationship between
conscience and God.

In the 13th century, St. Thomas Aquinas regarded conscience as the
application of moral knowledge to a particular case (S.T. I, q. 79, a.
13). Thus, conscience was considered an act or judgment of practical
reason that began with synderesis, the structured development of our
innate remnant awareness of absolute good (which he categorised as
involving the five primary precepts proposed in his theory of Natural
Law) into an acquired habit of applying moral principles.^([50])
According to Singer, Aquinas held that conscience, or conscientia was an
imperfect process of judgment applied to activity because knowledge of
the natural law (and all acts of natural virtue implicit therein) was
obscured in most people by education and custom that promoted
selfishness rather than fellow-feeling (Summa Theologiae, I–II,
I).^([94]) Aquinas also discussed conscience in relation to the virtue
of prudence to explain why some people appear to be less "morally
enlightened" than others, their weak will being incapable of adequately
balancing their own needs with those of others.^([95])

Aquinas reasoned that acting contrary to conscience is an evil action
but an errant conscience is only blameworthy if it is the result of
culpable or vincible ignorance of factors that one has a duty to have
knowledge of.^([94]) Aquinas also argued that conscience should be
educated to act towards real goods (from God) which encouraged human
flourishing, rather than the apparent goods of sensory pleasures.^([94])


Thomas A Kempis in the medieval contemplative classic The Imitation of
Christ (ca 1418) stated that the glory of a good man is the witness of a
good conscience. "Preserve a quiet conscience and you will always have
joy. A quiet conscience can endure much, and remains joyful in all
trouble, but an evil conscience is always fearful and uneasy."^([97])
The anonymous medieval author of the Christian mystical work The Cloud
of Unknowing similarly expressed the view that in profound and prolonged


always there, even after one's confession and however busy one is in
holy things: "therefore, whoever would work at becoming a contemplative
must first cleanse his [or her] conscience."^([98]) The medieval Flemish
mystic John of Ruysbroeck likewise held that true conscience has four
aspects that are necessary to render a man just in the active and
contemplative life: "a free spirit, attracting itself through love"; "an

Schopenhauer considered that the good conscience we experience after an
unselfish act verifies that our true self exists outside our physical
person.


thought produced by emotions and to fall in love with viewing problems
requiring moral decision from the perspective of eternity.^([101]) Thus,
living a life of peaceful conscience means to Spinoza that reason is
used to generate adequate ideas where the mind increasingly sees the
world and its conflicts, our desires and passions sub specie
aeternitatis, that is without reference to time.^([102]) Hegel's obscure
and mystical Philosophy of Mind held that the absolute right of freedom
of conscience facilitates human understanding of an all-embracing unity,
an absolute which was rational, real and true.^([103]) Nevertheless,
Hegel thought that a functioning State would always be tempted not to
recognize conscience in its form of subjective knowledge, just as
similar non-objective opinions are generally rejected in
science.^([104]) A similar idealist notion was expressed in the writings
of Joseph Butler who argued that conscience is God-given, should always
be obeyed, is intuitive, and should be considered the "constitutional
monarch" and the "universal moral faculty": "conscience does not only
offer itself to show us the way we should walk in, but it likewise
carries its own authority with it."^([105]) Butler advanced ethical
speculation by referring to a duality of regulative principles in human
nature: first, "self-love" (seeking individual happiness) and second,
"benevolence" (compassion and seeking good for another) in conscience
(also linked to the agape of situational ethics).^([51]) Conscience
tended to be more authoritative in questions of moral judgment, thought
Butler, because it was more likely to be clear and certain (whereas
calculations of self-interest tended to probable and changing
conclusions).^([106]) John Selden in his Table Talk expressed the view
that an awake but excessively scrupulous or ill-trained conscience could
hinder resolve and practical action; it being "like a horse that is not
well wayed, he starts at every bird that flies out of the


available in German translations in the 18th and 19th centuries, they
influenced philosophers such as Schopenhauer to hold that in a healthy
mind only deeds oppress our conscience, not wishes and thoughts; "for it
is only our deeds that hold us up to the mirror of our will"; the good
conscience, thought Schopenhauer, we experience after every
disinterested deed arises from direct recognition of our own inner being
in the phenomenon of another, it affords us the verification "that our


here is Kant's categorical imperative: "act only according to that maxim
by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal
law."^([110]) Kant considered critical conscience to be an internal
court in which our thoughts accuse or excuse one another; he
acknowledged that morally mature people do often describe contentment or
peace in the soul after following conscience to perform a duty, but
argued that for such acts to produce virtue their primary motivation
should simply be duty, not expectation of any such bliss.^([111])
Rousseau expressed a similar view that conscience somehow connected man
to a greater metaphysical unity. John Plamenatz in his critical
examination of Rousseau's work considered that conscience was there
defined as the feeling that urges us, in spite of contrary passions,
towards two harmonies: the one within our minds and between our

Samuel Johnson (1775) stated that "No man's conscience can tell him the
right of another man."

Other philosophers expressed a more sceptical and pragmatic view of the
operation of "conscience" in society.^([113]) John Locke in his Essays
on the Law of Nature argued that the widespread fact of human conscience
allowed a philosopher to infer the necessary existence of objective
moral laws that occasionally might contradict those of the
state.^([114]) Locke highlighted the metaethics problem of whether
accepting a statement like "follow your conscience" supports
subjectivist or objectivist conceptions of conscience as a guide in
concrete morality, or as a spontaneous revelation of eternal and
immutable principles to the individual: "if conscience be a proof of
innate principles, contraries may be innate principles; since some men
with the same bent of conscience prosecute what others avoid."^([115])
Thomas Hobbes likewise pragmatically noted that opinions formed on the
basis of conscience with full and honest conviction, nevertheless should
always be accepted with humility as potentially erroneous and not
necessarily indicating absolute knowledge or truth.^([116]) William
Godwin expressed the view that conscience was a memorable consequence of
the "perception by men of every creed when the descend into the scene of
busy life" that they possess free will.^([117]) Adam Smith considered
that it was only by developing a critical conscience that we can ever
see what relates to ourselves in its proper shape and dimensions; or
that we can ever make any proper comparison between our own interests
and those of other people.^([118]) John Stuart Mill believed that

of any community ripe for representative government, but that "it would



Josiah Royce (1855–1916) built on the transcendental idealism view of
conscience, viewing it as the ideal of life which constitutes our moral
personality, our plan of being ourself, of making common sense ethical
decisions. But, he thought, this was only true insofar as our conscience
also required loyalty to "a mysterious higher or deeper self".^([120])
In the modern Christian tradition this approach achieved expression with
Dietrich Bonhoeffer who stated during his imprisonment by the Nazis in
World War II that conscience for him was more than practical reason,
indeed it came from a "depth which lies beyond a man's own will and his
own reason and it makes itself heard as the call of human existence to
unity with itself."^([121]) For Bonhoeffer a guilty conscience arose as
an indictment of the loss of this unity and as a warning against the
loss of one's self; primarily, he thought, it is directed not towards a
particular kind of doing but towards a particular mode of being. It
protests against a doing which imperils the unity of this being with
itself.^([52]) Conscience for Bonhoeffer did not, like shame, embrace or
pass judgment on the morality of the whole of its owner's life; it
reacted only to certain definite actions: "it recalls what is long past
and represents this disunion as something which is already accomplished
and irreparable".^([122]) The man with a conscience, he believed, fights
a lonely battle against the "overwhelming forces of inescapable
situations" which demand moral decisions despite the likelihood of


that the truth distributed in the world, as the statement about human
dignity, as the affirmation of the line between good and evil, lives in
people as conscience.^([123])

[]



As Hannah Arendt pointed out, however, (following the utilitarian John
Stuart Mill on this point): a bad conscience does not necessarily
signify a bad character; in fact only those who affirm a commitment to
applying moral standards will be troubled with remorse, guilt or shame
by a bad conscience and their need to regain integrity and wholeness of
the self.^([124][125]) Representing our soul or true self by analogy as
our house, Arendt wrote that "conscience is the anticipation of the
fellow who awaits you if and when you come home."^([126]) Arendt
believed that people who are unfamiliar with the process of silent


"count on its being forgotten the next moment;" bad people are not full
of regrets.^([126]) Arendt also wrote eloquently on the problem of
languages distinguishing the word consciousness from conscience. One
reason, she held, was that conscience, as we understand it in moral or
legal matters, is supposedly always present within us, just like
consciousness: "and this conscience is also supposed to tell us what to
do and what to repent; before it became the lumen naturale or Kant's
practical reason, it was the voice of God."^([127])

Albert Einstein associated conscience with suprapersonal thoughts,
feelings and aspirations.

Albert Einstein, as a self-professed adherent of humanism and
rationalism, likewise viewed an enlightened religious person as one
whose conscience reflects that he "has, to the best of his ability,
liberated himself from the fetters of his selfish desires and is
preoccupied with thoughts, feelings and aspirations to which he clings


liberty, obligations should take precedence over rights in moral and
political philosophy and a spiritual awakening should occur in the
conscience of most citizens, so that social obligations are viewed as
fundamentally having a transcendent origin and a beneficent impact on
human character when fulfilled.^([130][131]) Simone Weil also in that
work provided a psychological explanation for the mental peace
associated with a good conscience: "the liberty of men of goodwill,
though limited in the sphere of action, is complete in that of
conscience. For, having incorporated the rules into their own being, the
prohibited possibilities no longer present themselves to the mind, and
have not to be rejected."^([132])

Alternatives to such metaphysical and idealist opinions about conscience
arose from realist and materialist perspectives such as those of Charles
Darwin. Darwin suggested that "any animal whatever, endowed with
well-marked social instincts, the parental and filial affections being
here included, would inevitably acquire a moral sense or conscience, as
soon as its intellectual powers had become as well, or as nearly as well
developed, as in man."^([133]) Émile Durkheim held that the soul and
conscience were particular forms of an impersonal principle diffused in
the relevant group and communicated by totemic ceremonies.^([134]) A. J.
Ayer was a more recent realist who held that the existence of conscience
was an empirical question to be answered by sociological research into
the moral habits of a given person or group of people, and what causes


believed, fell wholly within the scope of the existing social
sciences.^([135]) George Edward Moore bridged the idealistic and
sociological views of 'critical' and 'traditional' conscience in stating
that the idea of abstract 'rightness' and the various degrees of the
specific emotion excited by it are what constitute, for many persons,
the specifically 'moral sentiment' or conscience. For others, however,
an action seems to be properly termed 'internally right', merely because
they have previously regarded it as right, the idea of 'rightness' being



The French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir in A Very Easy Death (Une mort
très douce, 1964) reflects within her own conscience about her mother's
attempts to develop such a moral sympathy and understanding of
others.^([137])


Michael Walzer claimed that the growth of religious toleration in
Western nations arose amongst other things, from the general recognition
that private conscience signified some inner divine presence regardless
of the religious faith professed and from the general respectability,
piety, self-limitation, and sectarian discipline which marked most of
the men who claimed the rights of conscience.^([138]) Walzer also argued
that attempts by courts to define conscience as a merely personal moral
code or as sincere belief, risked encouraging an anarchy of moral
egotisms, unless such a code and motive was necessarily tempered with


individual to a universal spiritual order, or from the common principles
and mutual engagements of unselfish people.^([139]) Ronald Dworkin
maintains that constitutional protection of freedom of conscience is
central to democracy but creates personal duties to live up to it:
"Freedom of conscience presupposes a personal responsibility of
reflection, and it loses much of its meaning when that responsibility is
ignored. A good life need not be an especially reflective one; most of


because it forfeits dignity for ease."^([140]) Edward Conze stated it is
important for individual and collective moral growth that we recognise
the illusion of our conscience being wholly located in our body; indeed
both our conscience and wisdom expand when we act in an unselfish way
and conversely "repressed compassion results in an unconscious sense of
guilt."^([141])



Peter Singer: distinguished between immature "traditional" and highly
reasoned "critical" conscience

The philosopher Peter Singer considers that usually when we describe an



Moral anti-realists debate whether the moral facts necessary to activate
conscience supervene on natural facts with a posteriori necessity; or
arise a priori because moral facts have a primary intension and
naturally identical worlds may be presumed morally identical.^([143]) It
has also been argued that there is a measure of moral luck in how
circumstances create the obstacles which conscience must overcome to
apply moral principles or human rights and that with the benefit of
enforceable property rights and the rule of law, access to universal


conditions such as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and famine, people in
relatively prosperous developed countries have been spared pangs of
conscience associated with the physical necessity to steal scraps of
food, bribe tax inspectors or police officers, and commit murder in
guerrilla wars against corrupt government forces or rebel
armies.^([144]) Roger Scruton has claimed that true understanding of
conscience and its relationship with morality has been hampered by an
"impetuous" belief that philosophical questions are solved through the
analysis of language in an area where clarity threatens vested


inflicted on others.^([146]) Jonathan Glover wrote that most of us "do
not spend our lives on endless landscape gardening of our self" and our
conscience is likely shaped not so much by heroic struggles, as by
choice of partner, friends and job, as well as where we choose to
live.^([147]) Garrett Hardin, in a famous article called "The Tragedy of
the Commons", argues that any instance in which society appeals to an
individual exploiting a commons to restrain himself or herself for the
general good—by means of his or her conscience—merely sets up a system
which, by selectively diverting societal power and physical resources to
those lacking in conscience, while fostering guilt (including anxiety
about his or her individual contribution to over-population) in people
acting upon it, actually works toward the elimination of conscience from
the race.^([148][149])

John Ralston Saul: consumers risk turning over their conscience to
technical experts and to the ideology of free markets

John Ralston Saul expressed the view in The Unconscious Civilization

to technical experts; willingly restricting their moral freedom of
choice to limited consumer actions ruled by the ideology of the free



Some argue on religious or philosophical grounds that it is blameworthy
to act against conscience, even if the judgement of conscience is likely
to be erroneous (say because it is inadequately informed about the
facts, or prevailing moral (humanist or religious), professional
ethical, legal and human rights norms).^([151]) Failure to acknowledge
and accept that conscientious judgements can be seriously mistaken, may
only promote situations where one's conscience is manipulated by others
to provide unwarranted justifications for non-virtuous and selfish acts;
indeed, insofar as it is appealed to as glorifying ideological content,
and an associated extreme level of devotion, without adequate constraint
of external, altruistic, normative justification, conscience may be
considered morally blind and dangerous both to the individual concerned
and humanity as a whole.^([152]) Langston argues that philosophers of
virtue ethics have unnecessarily neglected conscience for, once
conscience is trained so that the principles and rules it applies are
those one would want all others to live by, its practise cultivates and
sustains the virtues; indeed, amongst people in what each society
considers to be the highest state of moral development there is little
disagreement about how to act.^([8]) Emmanuel Levinas viewed conscience
as a revelatory encountering of resistance to our selfish powers,
developing morality by calling into question our naive sense of freedom


being more severe the more rigorously the goal of our self was to obtain
control.^([153]) In other words, the welcoming of the Other, to Levinas,
was the very essence of conscience properly conceived; it encouraged our
ego to accept the fallibility of assuming things about other people,
that selfish freedom of will "does not have the last word" and that
realising this has a transcendent purpose: "I am not alone ... in
conscience I have an experience that is not commensurate with any a
priori [see a priori and a posteriori] framework-a conceptless
experience."^([153])

Amnesty International organises campaigns to protect those arrested and
or incarcerated as a prisoner of conscience because of their

Kyi of Burma, was the winner of the 2009 Amnesty International
Ambassador of Conscience Award. In legislation, a conscience clause is a
provision in a statute that excuses a health professional from complying
with the law (for example legalising surgical or pharmaceutical
abortion) if it is incompatible with religious or conscientious
beliefs.^([168]) Expressed justifications for refusing to obey laws
because of conscience vary. Many conscientious objectors are so for
religious reasons—notably, members of the historic peace churches are
pacifist by doctrine. Other objections can stem from a deep sense of


Dewey considered that conscientious objectors were often the victims of
"moral innocency" and inexpertness in moral training: "the moving force
of events is always too much for conscience".^([170]) The remedy was not
to deplore the wickedness of those who manipulate world power, but to
connect conscience with forces moving in another direction- to build
institutions and social environments predicated on the rule of law, for
example, "then will conscience itself have compulsive power instead of
being forever the martyred and the coerced."^([170]) As an example,
Albert Einstein who had advocated conscientious objection during the


the face of Nazi rearmament and advocated a world federalist
organization with its own professional army.^([171]) Samuel Johnson
pointed out that an appeal to conscience should not allow the law to
bring unjust suffering upon another. Conscience, according to Johnson,
was nothing more than a conviction felt by ourselves of something to be
done or something to be avoided; in questions of simple unperplexed
morality, conscience is very often a guide that may be trusted.^([172])
But before conscience can conclusively determine what morally should be
done, he thought that the state of the question should be thoroughly
known.^([172]) "No man's conscience", said Johnson "can tell him the
right of another man ... it is a conscience very ill informed that
violates the rights of one man, for the convenience of another."^([172])

World conscience

[edit]


government, Cosmopolitanism, and Common heritage of humanity

World conscience is the universalist idea that with ready global
communication, all people on earth will no longer be morally estranged
from one another, whether it be culturally, ethnically, or



Often this derives from a spiritual or natural law perspective, that for
world peace to be achieved, conscience, properly understood, should be
generally considered as not necessarily linked (often destructively) to
fundamentalist religious ideologies, but as an aspect of universal
consciousness, access to which is the common heritage of
humanity.^([192]) Thinking predicated on the development of world
conscience is common to members of the Global Ecovillage Network such as
the Findhorn Foundation, international conservation organisations like
Fauna and Flora International, as well as performers of world music such
as Alan Stivell.^([193]) Non-government organizations, particularly
through their work in agenda-setting, policy-making and implementation
of human rights-related policy, have been referred to as the conscience
of the world^([194])



coherence of global moral and scientific knowledge supporting the
premise that "only unified learning, universally shared, makes accurate
foresight and wise choice possible".^([195]) Thus, world conscience is a
concept that overlaps with the Gaia hypothesis in advocating a balance
of moral, legal, scientific and economic solutions to modern


development, biosequestration and legal protection of the biosphere and
biodiversity.^([196][197][198][199][200]) The NGO 350.org, for example,
seeks to attract world conscience to the problems associated with
elevation in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.^([201][202])

The American cardiologist Bernard Lown and the Russian cardiologist

catastrophic public health consequences of nuclear war in establishing
International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW) which
was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985 and continues to work to "heal
an ailing planet".^([206])
Worldwide expressions of conscience contributed to the decision of the
French government to halt atmospheric nuclear tests at Mururoa in the
Pacific in 1974 after 41 such explosions (although below-ground nuclear
tests continued there into the 1990s).^([207])

A challenge to world conscience was provided by an influential 1968
article by Garrett Hardin that critically analyzed the dilemma in which
multiple individuals, acting independently after rationally consulting
self-interest (and, he claimed, the apparently low
'survival-of-the-fittest' value of conscience-led actions) ultimately
destroy a shared limited resource, even though each acknowledges such an
outcome is not in anyone's long-term interest.^([148]) Hardin's

The critic A. C. Bradley discusses the central problem of Shakespeare's

King ("is't not perfect conscience to quit him with this arm?"
(v.ii.67)).^([264])

Bradley develops a theory about Hamlet's moral agony relating to a
conflict between "traditional" and "critical" conscience: "The
conventional moral ideas of his time, which he shared with the Ghost,
told him plainly that he ought to avenge his father; but a deeper
conscience in him, which was in advance of his time, contended with
these explicit conventional ideas. It is because this deeper conscience
remains below the surface that he fails to recognise it, and fancies he
is hindered by cowardice or sloth or passion or what not; but it emerges

tortured conscience. A promiscuous student, for example, in The Fit
describes it as a "dull pain, indefinite, vague; it was like anguish and
the most acute fear and despair ... in his breast, under the heart" and


experienced by the factory owner's daughter in From a Case Book calls it
an "unknown, mysterious power ... in fact close at hand and watching
him."^([269]) Characteristically, Chekhov's own conscience drove him on
the long journey to Sakhalin to record and alleviate the harsh
conditions of the prisoners at that remote outpost. As Irina
