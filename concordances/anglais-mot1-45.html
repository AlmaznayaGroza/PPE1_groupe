How does the conscious differ from the conscience? Being conscious is
the state of being awake and alert. Conscience, on the other hand,
refers to an awareness of whether actions are right or wrong.



At a Glance

While the two terms are often confused, the conscious and the conscience
refer to very different things. Your conscious allows you to be aware of
your place in the world, while your conscience allows you to behave in
this world in morally and socially acceptable ways. As described below,
being conscious refers to your awareness of yourself and the world
around you. Your conscience is your ability to distinguish between what
is right and what is wrong.

 What Does Conscience Mean?

right and wrong and keeps you from acting upon your most basic urges and
desires.

information about what is viewed as bad or negative by your parents and

upbringing. The conscience emerges over time as you take in information
about what is considered right and wrong by your caregivers, your peers,
and the culture in which you live.


caregiver's rules. For example, if a parent sets a rule, a child could
learn a sense of right and wrong regarding that topic. Studies have also
examined other factors that may affect the way conscience develops,
including the nature of the parent-child relationship, style of parental
discipline, and the child's temperament—but more research is needed.
